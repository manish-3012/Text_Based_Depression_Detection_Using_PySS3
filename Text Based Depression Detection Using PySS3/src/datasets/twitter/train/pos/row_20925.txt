Do I tell the girl I like her? So Ive known and been best friends with this girl since kindergarten and I like her. Thing is Im not allowed to date, even if i do date for marriage. I dont want to go behind my dads back bc heâ€™d get really angry. But, what do I do? Risk our lifelong friendship by telling her i like her? Cuz if the feeling isnâ€™t mutual then suddenly everything becomes awkward.
