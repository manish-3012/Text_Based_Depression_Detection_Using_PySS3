I need answers!! :( The weirdest shit just happened and I am so confused and annoyed.  I made a new friend at school, she is pretty cool and is fun to talk with, after two weeks, for some reason she unfollowed me on Insta,  I'm pretty sure I did nothing wrong, she never once has she been annoyed by my existence. Then 3 days later I find out she restricted me. Like WTF is going on here. I did not ask her why she did that, let alone she still seemed fine when I go up to her and talk to her. It is my birthday after 2 days (turning 16), I was getting a skateboard for my birthday. Luckily she was a skateboarder too, but since she "restricted me" I cannot show her my skateboard. I honestly have no clue on what happened, is there anything I can do to solve this stupid mystery
