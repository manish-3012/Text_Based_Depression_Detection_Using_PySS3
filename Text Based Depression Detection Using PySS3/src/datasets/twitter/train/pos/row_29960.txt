How tf am I supposed to meet people in my college when most of my classes are online? I enjoyed orientation and started to get to know some people and I was getting excited to meet my classmates but Iâ€™m realizing Iâ€™m probably only going to have like 2 in person classes a week and you canâ€™t really get to know people through zoom. Plus on top of that my school doesnâ€™t have a dining hall which makes bumping into people much harder. Like I was getting to know a girl during orientation but now like even if she is in one of my classes who knows if Iâ€™ll actually be able to speak to her. Little how the hell do they expect us to make friends?
