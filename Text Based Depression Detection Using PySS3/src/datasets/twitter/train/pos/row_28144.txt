How bad is underage drinking ? Of course, my parents will never allow me or buy me alcohol (they also don't drink since it's haram). I've bought some tools to make my own alcohol. I'm using bread yeast actually, it's not best but good enough.

Anyways, I'm only 14. I just want to try once. I told mom I'm making vinegar , and part of making vinegar is making alcohol.  

I would guess the bread yeast I'm using makes from 7-9 % ethanol wine. I'm using grape juice btw.

How dangerous would it be to just try maybe half a cup?  This drink is high in sugar but got enough ethanol to be drunk.

I'm not planning on making this drink regularly , since turning it into vinegar takes time, so at maximum i can if i want to try it once every 1.5 month.

Will this damage my Brian too much? How bad can it go ? What's also the dangerous dose ?
