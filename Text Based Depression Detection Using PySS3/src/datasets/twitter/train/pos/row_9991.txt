I made a bee-movie themed social media platform Yup just like the title, I started this around 2 months ago as a joke but it turned out much better than planned. I dunno just thought u guys would enjoy it. I made it from scratch which I'm really happy about since I'm new to this whole coding thing.

Show it some love, make and account and stuff. Don't try and abuse it cos its still in beta testing stages, lmk of any serious bugs. Many thanks.

Here is the link to it: [https://scopreon.net/beemessenger/](https://scopreon.net/beemessenger/)
