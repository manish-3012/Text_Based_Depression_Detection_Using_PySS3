Currently getting yelled at by a bunch of girls cause iâ€™m a misogynist apparently So this one girl from my school made a tiktok of her doing pullups without weight. She did 3, and you could really just see a few back muscle and people went crazy.

I said â€œbruh I could do 3 in my sleepâ€ as a joke cause me and her have joked before, but she took it seriously. A bunch of her friends said â€œwhat are u mad cuz a girl is stronger than u?â€

I then posted a video of me doing 20 dead hang weighted pullups and tagged everyone in it. Got lots more hate. That girl that made the video is now trashing me.
