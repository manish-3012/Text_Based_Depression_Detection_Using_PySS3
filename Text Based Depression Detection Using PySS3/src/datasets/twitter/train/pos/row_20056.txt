I got a girlfriend!!! Itâ€™s taken a long while, but after many rejections and a couple of bouts with mental illness, Iâ€™ve finally found a special someone who I can enjoy spending time with and feels the same way :))

Sheâ€™s so understanding, comforting and just a general bop to be around. I still have some growth to make before I feel completely comfortable in myself, but weâ€™re trying hard to make it work, and I would be lying if I said we arenâ€™t making good progress. 

For those of you who are struggling to find someone, donâ€™t give up hope, thereâ€™s somebody out there waiting just for you.
