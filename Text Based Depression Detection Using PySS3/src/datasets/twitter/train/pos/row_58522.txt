I'm fucking pissed. i slammed my face on the wall yesterday and started bleeding and it's going to be swollen for atleast 5 days. my sister keeps eating all the snacks which has to be shared with us and it's not the first time, even before I was injured she eats my portion too and I forget to eat it because of classes and playing games etc but when I need it, it's all gone bc she took it?? idk if I'm supposed to be mad but now that I really want to eat, it's all gone because she's eating everything
