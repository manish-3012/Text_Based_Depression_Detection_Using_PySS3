Iâ€™m having a really rough day and I donâ€™t wanna socialize but I have to School started this for me and I really havenâ€™t been doing well emotionally, in part because of school and in part because of other things I donâ€™t need to go into here

Anyway for the past 5 months Iâ€™ve been organizing weekly zoom meetings with my friends for us to all hang out and talk and weâ€™re supposed to have one in half an hour but I just really donâ€™t feel up to it rn but at the same time I know if I donâ€™t start it everyone will get freaked out and I donâ€™t wanna have to deal with a ton of people asking me where I am when literally anyone can just start a zoom meeting. On top of that I know if I donâ€™t hang out with them Iâ€™ll probably just be in my room crying alone for a couple hours so thatâ€™s not exactly a good option either

I just feel like everything sucks and idk what to do
