Weird boner causes Okay, so I have an Oculus Quest 1 (vr headset) and I got some shooting games on it. Every time I play and use like a really big gun, or dual wield pistols or anything â€œbadassâ€, I get a boner. The sheer badassery gets me hard.

Same thing with another vr game, Physics Playground, where you can use physics objects as a weapon, and stab enemies to death with kunais or a fucking katana. When I get stealthy or something and Iâ€™m boutta stab some dude in the heart, my duck just goes rock-mode.

Is this just a me thing, or can other dudes relate?

Anyways, thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
