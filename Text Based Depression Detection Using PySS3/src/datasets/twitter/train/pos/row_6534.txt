Advice from an attack helicopter, about attack helicopters 1. We fly at around 100-200 mph on average.
2. We can fly up to roughly 250 miles on average before needing to stop and refuel. 
3. Don't mess with us when we're having a bad day, or we will probably shoot or bomb you.
4. Don't get too high around us; we're already 10000 ft in the air.
5. We have a large variety of weapons, including missiles, machine guns, bombs, etc.
6. Our primary role as a military vehicle is to engage with ground troops, either that be for surveillance or to attack enemy infantry and armoured vehicles.
7. We like pancakes.
