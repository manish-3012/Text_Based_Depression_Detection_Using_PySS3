I'm quitting vaping I've vaped like 3-4 times now, and I'm noticing strong nic cravings. It's been about 1-2 weeks since I last vaped, and the cravings are mostly over, and I was planning on getting a juul but now I'm realizing I do not wanna fall into addiction. 

I'm gonna take the signs and dodge this bullet while I can. Have a good one guys.
