I am done with daylight savings time So my dad works in Saudi Arabia and I live in Eastern US. I had to move to Saudi to be with my dad for 2 ~3 months. Because I only have online school, I thought it would be a breeze. Not only do I have to go to bed around 12:00 I have to wake up at 6:00 because my dad is strict and wants me to run early. My school starts at 4:00 pm and ends at 9:00 pm. It doesn't seem bad because you usually play video games during that time but it's school. Then American daylight savings time happens and I finish around 10:00. Also I have to eat dinner at lunch which is annoying. Thanks for listening to my rant.
