I think r/2000sgirls should be banned and hereâ€™s why Whenever I search up this sub the sub r/2000sgirls or whatever is always one of the first things to appear. I looked at the sun out of curiosity. Itâ€™s a porn sub which for this site isnâ€™t weird. What I hate though is that these young girls whom some can still participate in this sub are using their bodies for pornography. I donâ€™t feel like people my age or 19 should be able to do this kind of thing. Is it just me
