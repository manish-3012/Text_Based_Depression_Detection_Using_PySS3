Itâ€™s my 19th birthday lads The last few have been pretty bad (this one included, I just had minor surgery so ugh) BUT I was hoping to get maybe a few â€œhappy birthdayâ€ wishes on here? Iâ€™ve lost a good majority of my friends over the last few months so I donâ€™t have many people who really care about my birthday except like my grandparents and an old friend. You donâ€™t have to mean it, it would just be nice to see at least a few random teenagers from the internet spent like two seconds typing it out
