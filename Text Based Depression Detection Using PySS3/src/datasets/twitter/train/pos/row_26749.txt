Whoever is on the school board shall burn 1000 hells for this So me and the bois get our new school laptops right? We soon figure out that we can download free VPN and other unblocking tools on Firefox. So after loading our government properly with a definitely not malware we try to see what we can access. The results are astounding, youtube, netflix, xbox, steam, minecraft, *pornhub*..... all unblocked, everything. Except one... coolmath games, tried it many times, didn't work, coolmath has been blocked for 4 years in my district, and we thought we had just liberated it. But no. Of all the websites of the entire internet, *coolmath games* was locked down tighter than my crush's pussy. Just why. What has the world come to when I can LITERALLY BUY SOMEONE OFF THE BLACK MARKET BEFORE I CAN PLAY FUCKING RUN 3. If I ever find out who did this I'll make the Berkeley bike lock dude look like fuckin Gandhi.
