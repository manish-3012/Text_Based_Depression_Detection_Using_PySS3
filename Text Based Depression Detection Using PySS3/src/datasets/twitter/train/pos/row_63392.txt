Thatâ€™s not even what I asked... Me: (Casually) â€œDo I put my phone back at 10?â€

Dad: (Aggravated) â€œWell, last time when I trusted you, you weant on it at night anyway.â€

He then proceeds to rant about how immature I am. Then:

Dad: â€œSo you need to put it back after you do your homework. And donâ€™t rushâ€ and tells me to not do things, that I never even considered or have a history of doing, and was extremely patronizing.

I get it. Discipline and shit, he already did it the other day. But... I asked a simple question?? Jesus Christ??

I asked â€œDo I put my phone back at 10?â€ Not â€œWhy the FUCK did you take my phone, why do I have to put it back? Bitch.â€
