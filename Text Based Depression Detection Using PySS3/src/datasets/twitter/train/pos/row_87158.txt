I really do not like this sub when images are allowed So far today (15 minutes on here), I have seen dozens of terrifically unfunny memes using formats that stopped being funny 2 years ago, a photo of someone's ACTUAL SHIT, and an original meme that was reposted five minutes later with one number changed to avoid the repost bot. 

I miss text post weekend already =(
