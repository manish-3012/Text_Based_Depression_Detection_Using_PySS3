So since im 17 can i just basically do whatever i want now? I mean not whatever i want of course lol. But like my mom has always been overprotective over me. Doesnt let me out the house much to see friends or anything, hardly lets me drive, or even get a ride by people i know and even restricts me from going to certain places like a mall because she thinks itâ€™s dangerous.

I turned 17 today and like, can i just not listen to her? I mean what is she gonna do? Give a 17 year old a whooping? Ground me? Idk lol i just kinda wanna rebel now
