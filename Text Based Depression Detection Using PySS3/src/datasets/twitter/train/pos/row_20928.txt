Itâ€™s my birthday Itâ€™s my birthday,19yo, and Iâ€™m still lonely.
Iâ€™m here with my dogo browsing reddit. No friend ,no girlfriend .i just some of my family and people from work who Â«Â celebrateÂ Â» with me .
Iâ€™m almost crying writing this realising that Iâ€™m f** lonely and thinking that will be the case for the rest of my life .
BUT Iâ€™m not discouraged,Iâ€™m getting help and have goals to get a better social life and be dammed for the rest of my life .
