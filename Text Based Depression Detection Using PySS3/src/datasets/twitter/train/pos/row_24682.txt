Hereâ€™s a lil story So the other day was one of my friends 16th birthday so we where having a sleep over, it was going well we had had dinner and gone to the beach. At abt 1am and we where all laying in the backyard looking at the stars and talking for and then someone said â€œwhy donâ€™t we walk down to the park?â€ So 2 people stayed behind and the rest of us snuck out of her house. 

When we got to the park we basically just fooled around on all the swings and shit, thereâ€™s a big matrix in the park so we where just chilling on that for a while and randomly the chick whoâ€™s birthday it was started crying and everyone was like â€œoh shit, whatâ€™s wrong?â€ and she just replied with â€œyou know a couple years ago I didnâ€™t think I would have made it to 16, I didnâ€™t think that my life was going to get any better and yet here I am, here we are, I couldnâ€™t have asked for better people in my life and I thank you all for being there for meâ€ 

It just rlly hit me yâ€™know, I didnâ€™t know her before high school but even now sheâ€™s always so positive and outgoing and I couldnâ€™t of imagined her any other way. I didnâ€™t know of her past and when my friends explained it to me I questioned how well I actually know anyone. It reinforced well kind of like a saying I have which is â€œ the people who seem to have it all together, always smiling and look happy are the ones who have the saddest storiesâ€

No ones going to read this but writing helps me think abt things
