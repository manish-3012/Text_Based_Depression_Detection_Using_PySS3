Post-Exam Anxiety I get post-exam anxiety every time after I've taken my tests._.I would start calculating my grades and looking for answers online because I'm scared I did something wrongâ€”most of the time, I did get them wrong. Today is one of those days again:( I know I did something wrong on the test, and I can't stop thinking about itðŸ˜­does anyone know a tip that can get rid of this thought? It's sooo annoying i just wanna relax after my test.
