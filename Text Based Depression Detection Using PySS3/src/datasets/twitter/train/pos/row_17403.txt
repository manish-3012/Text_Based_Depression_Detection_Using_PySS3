Can I have advice So Iâ€™ve been friends with this girl since the start of secondary/ high school and I think she likes me but I canâ€™t be sure and I kinda like her too but idk what to do. Can anyone help at all?

Edit: I forgot to mention this and itâ€™s that Iâ€™m a bi guy and she could just think Iâ€™m like a gay best friend. Idk
