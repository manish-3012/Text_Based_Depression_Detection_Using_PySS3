How do I forget someone? So I've met this girl, and I kind of started liking her, even though we have never met in person before. I did tell her that I liked her but it didn't get awkward or anything.
Later we started talking more and getting to know each other, but I can't for the sake of it, get her out of my mind, keep in mind I haven't even seen her in person
