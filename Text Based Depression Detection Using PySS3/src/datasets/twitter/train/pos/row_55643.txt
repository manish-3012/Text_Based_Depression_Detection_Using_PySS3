I have an addiction I need to confess something. It's been controlling my life. I'm draining my bank account because of it. 

I have an addiction to buying new swimsuits. 

You see, I'm a competitive swimmer, and I buy tons of practice suits. Those are excusable, because I use them for practice. What's not excusable is the bikinis I buy.

Anytime I'm in a store, I'm instantly drawn to the swimsuit section. I've probably spent close to $300 dollars on swimsuits this summer alone. 

After counting up my collection I have 20 bikini sets, and about 10 stray tops and bottoms. Mind you, this doesn't include the amount of practice suits I have. 

I even got rid of a lot at the beginning of the summer. 

I just really like swimsuits goddamnit, but I honestly have a problem at this point.
