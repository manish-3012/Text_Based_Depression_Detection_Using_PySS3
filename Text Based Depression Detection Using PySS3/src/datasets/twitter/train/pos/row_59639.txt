My 2 biggest insecurities I want help with 1. A very common one, weight, I want to be skinny but unfortunately my sucky mom never taught me about healthy eating but I honestly donâ€™t think she knows about it herself......I struggle with finding things to eat and my parents typically just get me super processed foods even when I tell them not to

2. A bit weird but I hate how dry my feet are, the skin is so dry and ugly and weird and when I was younger I would literally just scratch tf out of it out of anger so now itâ€™s rlly...weird looking uggghhhhhh frick younger me
