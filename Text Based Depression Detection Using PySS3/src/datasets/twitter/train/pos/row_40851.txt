â€œIf being a depressed teen wasnâ€™t a stereotype, a lot of people could have got help at a younger age.â€ -me. -or someone else if theyâ€™ve already thought of this

I wasnâ€™t allowed to put this on r/showerthoughts as it breaks its rules but I thought it would be appreciated here. 

I feel like just because it is a stereotype teenagers get shit for it and canâ€™t actually get the help we are told to get by literally everyone. Because when we try people just say things like: â€œyouâ€™re 15 youâ€™re just doing this for attention or somethingâ€ it any age just an eg).

This really grinds my gears
