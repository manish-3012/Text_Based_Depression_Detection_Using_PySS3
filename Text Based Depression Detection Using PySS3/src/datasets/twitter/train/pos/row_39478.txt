My bestfriend of 3 years came out as bi last night told me they liked me I was just trying to download a pirated version of Photoshop CS6 last night when my bestfriend decided to tell me that he liked me. I asked if he was gay and he answered that he was bi. I don't hold any feelings towards him and told him as gently as I could so as not to ruin our friendship.

I still treat him as my bestfriend. I'm just concerned that he'll slowly not talk to me anymore because he got rejected. Maybe he'll feel weird about hanging out with me from this point on.

I need advice on how to continue our friendship, thanks
