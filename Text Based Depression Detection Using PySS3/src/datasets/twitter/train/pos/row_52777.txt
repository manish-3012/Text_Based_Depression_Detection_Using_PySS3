Today was a tragedy This guy in my class is so perfect I stg. I saw his insta pfp that he just changed and he looks sooo freaking good I can't. Anyways these past few days we had sex Ed and it was awful today was our last day and we talked about the r word and me and my friends started to cry. I cried because they were crying and the r word is for some reason very close to home and idk why. In my head I thought people were gonna think that it was weird that me the only guy in my whole girl domininated friend group was crying but no one seemed to notice. I also got my guitar practice book so I can now start playing. Anywhoozles I hope everyone is having or has a good day.
