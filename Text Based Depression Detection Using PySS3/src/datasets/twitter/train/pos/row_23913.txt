Anyone remember Peter Jacksonâ€™s King Kong? One of my favorite, if not my favorite movie of all time. Just watched it again for the first time in a few years and I was again blown away by the visual effects. I know it came out in 2005, but I hope a few people here have seen it. Kong dying still got me crying man :(
The video game that came out with the movie is also one of the best movie video games ever made.
