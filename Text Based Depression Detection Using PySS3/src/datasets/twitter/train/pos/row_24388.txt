Help me to continue my story So the four guys in team Atria want to train at the basketball court, they want to train their magical powers and their monster partners. When they arrive are the four girls in team Atria already training and waiting for them. How should they react to each other, I don't want it to be like: "Ow they our teammates are already there let's train with them not minding that they already started before the journey tomorrow!"

So drop here your suggestions (no sexual things, minors are reading okay?)
