How can I make my parents allow me to download games (My english isn't very good so please pardon the mistakes i might make while writing this) 
My parents are on the strict side of parenting and recently they bought me a new laptop for online school. They bought me one because i was doing very well at school and i asked them if i could download atleast 1 game on it but they refused. The game i wanted to download was Minecraft Java edition because my friends play all the time and they really want me to join them. The reason my parents keep refusing is because games might interfere with my grades, but i highly doubt it because i had tons of games on my tablet which didn't affect my grades even a tiny bit.

TL:DR: How can I make my parents let me download Minecraft on my laptop?
