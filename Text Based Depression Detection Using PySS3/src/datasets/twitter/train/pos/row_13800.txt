I just drank a Monster for the first time ðŸ‘**DRINK**ðŸ‘**REVIEW**

Okay so I decided to join the Kyle Cult and drank a can of Monster Energy. After engaging in an act of capitalism at my local gas station and brought the goods home, I took my first sip. Basically it tasted like someone melted down a bunch of sour candies and made a drink out of it, caffiene level was enough to make me a bit more alert but not enough to "Unleash the beast inside me" like the can said. That might be because of my tolerance built up over years of caffeine consumption, and it probably is, or it could be because of a shortcoming with the drink. Regardless, it's just a nitpick and the drink woke me up a bit anyway, not really making enter the avatar state and open my third eye of hyperactivity like I experienced it to. With that said I think overall it was a pretty decent drink, I'll give it a 7/10 for now but part of me thinks Monster might be a bit of an acquired taste. That's it for the review, see ya
