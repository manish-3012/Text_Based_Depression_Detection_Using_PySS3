What is wrong with reddit? On smaller subreddits, you can make a post, and have meaningful, well, how meaningful is up to debate, but have discussions at least. But then there are the, "Major Subreddits", like r/WTF, r/Teenagers, r/AskReddit, etc. Now, this isn't true for all of them, but the amount of shitty references and cumbrain responses is staggering.
