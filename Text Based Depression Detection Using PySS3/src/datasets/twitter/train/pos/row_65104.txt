I need help with love I am in love with my friend (lets call him bob) and i don't know what to do. I cant go a day without thinking about him but not only does he have a girlfriend but he is not gay or bi (i dont think) so i would not have a chance. We are really close and according to my friend billy he is startibg to think i love him. Tonight i was going to text him and tell him. I think he has a right to know even if u have no chance. But my friend billy think i should wait for hin and his girlfriend to break up (sad to say he does nit keep dates for long) i juat think that is wrong but i really trust Billy i have ni clue what to do and i could really use some advise
