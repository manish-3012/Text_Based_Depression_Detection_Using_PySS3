I just got yelled at for something I didnt do So, its lunch time, and I was trying to figure out what to eat. My brothers and parents had the last of the leftovers, and since were going to Costco tomorrow to get more frozen food, we dont really have that. 

I'm not a super decisive person, so I was taking my time, looking around, trying to decide what to have. My dad asked me what I was going to eat, and before I could say anything, my mom, in a mocking, borderline yelling voice said "he just wants to stand there and ask what everyone else had even though he watched all of us eat and knows that stuff is gone like he does every day", blah blah...

So I pointed out that whenever I ask what other people had, I was in class in my room, and I actually dont know what they had, and that whenever i ask, it's because I want to get ideas, and that I don't ask whenever I know what other people had.

Now my mom is super fucking mad at me for something SHE brought up, that I do IF I DONT KNOW SOMETHING.  

And now I cant have lunch, and I'm hungry because I didnt eat a very big breakfast, and my mom is going to make me go walk downtown with them (which she KNOWS very fucking well stresses me out because less then half of the people are wearing masks close quarters, and my dad is high risk and I really don't want to lose my dad to this stupid virus) then go sledding, and is going to get mad at me for not doing much and being hungry, and it's my fault she yelled at me and caused me not to eat.
