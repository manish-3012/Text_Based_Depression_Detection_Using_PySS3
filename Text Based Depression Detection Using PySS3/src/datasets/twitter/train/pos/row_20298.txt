How to access any blocked website on a chromebook under a GoGaurdian Firewall. (Most common firewall used by schools) First, search "chrome://settings" into your address bar

&amp;#x200B;

once you are in your google settings, get to your Authoritative Certificates by going into

&amp;#x200B;

Security &gt; Manage Certificates &gt; Authorities

&amp;#x200B;

from there, scroll down to "org-Amazon"

&amp;#x200B;

Untrust all four of the certificates by pressing

&amp;#x200B;

â‹® &gt; edit

&amp;#x200B;

from there simply uncheck all of the blue ticks. Hit OK.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, scroll down until "org-Starfield Technologies, Inc."

&amp;#x200B;

Untrust the Starfield certificates the same as you did Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you are done, refresh your page.

&amp;#x200B;

Open a new tab and try to access a website that would normally be blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

If you gain access with no problem, you're good to go.

&amp;#x200B;

If the blocked by administrator screen pops up, you have one more step.

&amp;#x200B;

Press search + esc. (The search key usually has a magnifying glass on it, but on some models its just a circle above shift)

&amp;#x200B;

A small window should pop up. From there click "Memory Footprint"

&amp;#x200B;

End all of the processes that have a gray circle with a white triangle inside of it. (This is the GoGaurdian symbol)

&amp;#x200B;

Scroll through and find them all in the list. (to end a process simply click on it and press the large button that reads "End Process")

&amp;#x200B;

Next, close that window and refresh your page.
