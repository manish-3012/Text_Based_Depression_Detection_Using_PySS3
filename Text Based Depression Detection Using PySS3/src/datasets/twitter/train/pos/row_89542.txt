Did Diesel Patches actually leave YouTube? For those of you who don't know, Diesel Patches is a youtuber who recently hit 1 million subscribers. After hitting 1 million subscribers, he changed his channel banner to a statement that said that he was leaving. He hasn't addressed this anywhere else as far as I'm concerned.


What do you guys think?
