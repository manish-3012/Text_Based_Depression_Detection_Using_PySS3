My parents use me as a â€œvictimâ€ to scream at for no reason when theyâ€™re angry. So you people probably know parents and their busy lives. Same here. Theyâ€™re always running around and in their stress they release their tension and anger that they get from doing work on me. Still ainâ€™t used to it tho. Still get angry every time.
