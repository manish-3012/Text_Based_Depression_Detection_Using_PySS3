I was gonna make a second post regarding my quest for the biggest snickers bar, as I have, in fact found the biggest one. But unfortunately, r/teenagers mods are dumb and gay and donâ€™t allow image posts on weekends. Seriously mods, what the fuck? Nobody wants to make friends, we just want extra karma from our memes. I request that we be allowed to post whatever we want, whenever we want. Maybe just encourage text posts, or have bots push them to the front, but I just want to be able to post memes on weekends, the best days to post memes.

Mods, I donâ€™t actually mean you any offense, I just think itâ€™s really stupid. At the VERY LEAST, is there a way you can just have the posts left on pending until images are allowed again.

Thanks for your consideration
