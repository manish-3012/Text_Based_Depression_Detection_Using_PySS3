Among us lobbies are something else I decide to join a random lobby and I see some trash names like horny girl, Eboy, etc which I'm used to, but last but not least "DrSexMD" is in the lobby. I laugh a little then start walking to my tasks when the game starts but I'm greeted with a meeting 10 seconds in. I check the chat and DrSex tells everyone to vote me out. I ask why and it was apparently because I chose my color to be orange. Then before i vote myself, I ask again one final
time. Why? 
"Doctor's orders."
