I need help with my hair (15m) So the people that cut your hair (idk what to call them in english) have stopped working due to corona and my hair is a litteral hell, im thinking of going bald (i think i would be able to but i cant do anything good with my hair) but i dont know if it would fit with my face and i just dont know what to do. Any advice at all would really be appreciated
Edit: i can dm my face so yall can give some better advice
