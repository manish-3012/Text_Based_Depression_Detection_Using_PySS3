I don't see why people have so much self-hate for themselves. One thing that I don't really understand is why you would hate yourself so much. Why should you hate yourself if you're going to be you for the rest of your life. The only thing that will ever come from you hated yourself is you just dragging your own self down and losing friends. Self-hate doesn't do anything to improve you if anything it just drags you down. If you don't like the way you currently are, you shouldn't hate yourself and put yourself down so much, you can improve yourself and make yourself better. 

And if you're still reading this I hope you've had a good day ^^ and stay strong and keep your chin up!
