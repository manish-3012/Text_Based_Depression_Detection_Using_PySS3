Life is interesting when you spend time with Gen X conspiracy theorists in the midst of a pandemic They think the government is doing something behind the scenes. My mom told me to not believe what the government says. Her boyfriend was telling me how even when people from causes not related to the corona virus, itâ€™s still marked as COVID-19. I asked where I could find this information and he said itâ€™s on Facebook. So, Iâ€™m not supposed to believe the government, but Iâ€™m somehow supposed to believe what I see on internationalgatheringofboomers.com? He also used the fact that when more people died from other diseases, we werenâ€™t forced to live the way we do, to back up his argument. They think that the government wants control.
