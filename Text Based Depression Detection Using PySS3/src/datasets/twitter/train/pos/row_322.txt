Anyone else...? Does anyone else have anxiety attacks here? I havenâ€™t met someone who also has them. Itâ€™s always night when they happen, so my bf and my friends are asleep. Iâ€™ve tried the 5-4-3-2-1 thing and the finger tricks but nothing works.
Iâ€™ve lit candles and put scents around but nothing works. Any other ideas..?
