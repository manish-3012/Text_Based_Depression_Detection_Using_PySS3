Guys, I have this really cool idea for a dystopian novel! So basically, thereâ€™s this huge virus that ends up breaking loose and people start dropping like flies!

But people realize that the teens and kids seem to be immune, however itâ€™s not the case!

People want to send the children back to school, where some of them will die. Teachers have to write their wills because theyâ€™re being exposed to large amounts of possibly sick children!

And get this? Over 200,000 children have a chance of dying! And the government knows this but still wants to send them back!

^oh ^wait
