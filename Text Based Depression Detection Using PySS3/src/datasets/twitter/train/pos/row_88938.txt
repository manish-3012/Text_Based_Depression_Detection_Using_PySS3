My dad just said watching TV and playing video games isnâ€™t relaxing I said I didnâ€™t study for the ACT at all because I wanted to relax by watching Disney+ and stuff, and he says thatâ€™s not relaxing. Apparently, relaxing is â€œgardeningâ€ and â€œnatureâ€ stuff. I hate my life. I would argue with him, but he never listens so no point.
