I need support, but I don't want to bother my friends. I feel very quite shitty and overwhelmed. There are a bunch of bigger assignments that I gotta do at some point, which is making me feel pressured. I haven't been able to work on music (which is my biggest hobby) from a lack of creativity (which makes me feel bad about myself) lately. I also wish I could present more feminine but fear that people would laugh/reject me because I am a boy. And all of my close friends are dealing with either mental issues or shitty households, so I 1. feel exhausted from supporting them (which makes me feel like an asshole), 2. feel bad from empathizing with them so much, 3. don't want to talk about *my* problems, because I don't want to bother them.

I just wanna curl up in a ball and cry my lungs out. But I can't because my family is at home, so here I am, posting a rant on Reddit. :(
