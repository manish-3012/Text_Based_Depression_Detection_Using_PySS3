Just got left for another guy My girlfriend of 1 year and 5 months just broke up with me for a guy shes only liked for â€œa couple of daysâ€. Our relationship was going great and I was supposed to hangout with her today, but i woke up and she just broke up with me. What can I do to cope with this? Iâ€™m going over a friends house but if anyone has any good ideas of things to do it would be helpful, this is my first time experiencing something like this :/
