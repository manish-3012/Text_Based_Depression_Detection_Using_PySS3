I did an poem today Once again
 Where are you?
 Where are you?
 In this huge sky
 Where could you be

 I'm looking slowly
 Until I find you
 Hours go by
 Flashing only

 Where are you?
 Where are you?
 The dark green of your eyes
 I need to unravel

 Every night in the moonlight
 I'm looking for you
 Hoping to find you
 In the reflection of the moon looking for me.
