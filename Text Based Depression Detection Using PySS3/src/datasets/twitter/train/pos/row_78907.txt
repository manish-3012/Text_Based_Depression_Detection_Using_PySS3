I don't get why people get mad at this because they're literally complimenting you. Let's use the names Stacy and Leo to not get confused.

So if Stacy calls Leo a 'fatass', in the real world, Leo would get mad but what Leo doesn't understand is that Stacy is literally calling him thicc and Stacy is literally telling Leo that he/she has a higher chance of finding a gf/bf than herself/himself. Everybody uses 'fatass' as an insult and I don't really understand that. If someone calls me a 'fatass', I'd be happy and they'd be confused if they find out that I'm happy by what they think is an 'insult' and that's why I'd never call someone I hate a 'fatass' (and I wouldn't call someone I love a 'fatass' because I know what they're going to think)
