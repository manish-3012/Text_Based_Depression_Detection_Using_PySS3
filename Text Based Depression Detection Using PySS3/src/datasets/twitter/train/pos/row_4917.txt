Anyone ever do dares in order to get themselves to do stuff? I asked someone to dare me to leave a certain social media platform...it works, but now I feel like I may have been a tad bit manipulative. 

It did work...sort of...I think of logging in a lot. 

Ok, also, I dare you/race you to get done anything you have to get done
