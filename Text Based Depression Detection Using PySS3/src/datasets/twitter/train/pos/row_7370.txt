I don't want to exist I feel shitty about my sexuality (bi or pan, can't really choose) because I've internalized all the homophobia from my parents. I feel shitty about all of the people I haven't helped, the money I haven't donated, the people I've hurt. I have a job, which right now is fucking awful because someone who actually deserved it could've gotten it. I don't want to attempt suicide just because I can't guarantee it'll work, does anyone have tips for not feeling numb/sad/angry all the time?
