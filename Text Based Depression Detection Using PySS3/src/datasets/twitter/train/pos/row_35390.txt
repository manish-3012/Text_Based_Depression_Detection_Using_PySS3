I am very grateful for what i have achieved untill now I am currently 17 and i am very grateful for my life untill now, i managed to get the phone i liked, i got a laptop i didn't get the girl i liked but that doesnt matter also i kinda got a car, my dad said if you can fix it its yours and so i did also school is going great i am not in top of my class or anything but i managed to get the pretty good grades, now before you start talking anything i am gonna tell you that i worked my ass of okay summer,winter all the time, crunched through 5hours of sleep while managing good grades.All and all the effort is paying.Now i did it i am pretty sure you can do it too have a good night ;)
