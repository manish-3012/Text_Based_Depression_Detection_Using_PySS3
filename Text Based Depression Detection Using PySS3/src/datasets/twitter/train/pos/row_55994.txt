How do I support my dad whoâ€™s going to college? Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t your typical post here. Iâ€™m in middle school and my father who is 50 is currently applying to college since he didnâ€™t have an opportunity to get that education. Heâ€™s an immigrant from South East Asia and doesnâ€™t speak English well, heâ€™s only lived here for about 15 years and has to use that time to take care of me and my brother so he wasnâ€™t able to pick up the language as much as heâ€™d want. Now that heâ€™s going back into education, how do I support him? Iâ€™m not too wise on college since well, I havenâ€™t even gone to high school so I just wanna know whatâ€™s the best I could do to help him.
