My crush confessed to my friend Damn. What was i thinking. There's no way I'll end up with her. On the one hand, I was shattered, sad and broke like a glass full of wine that shattered when it hit the floor. One the other hand, I was happy because my friend happy. I was relieved because I don't need to think about her again. She would be better off with him. And perhaps, emptiness in my heart can't be filled with love but something else. Something that's better for me in future.
