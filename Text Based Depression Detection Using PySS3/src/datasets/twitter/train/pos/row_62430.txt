We need to stop these animal abuse channels Recently Reddit managed to remove a YouTube channel that abused monkeys. Since then, another channel has been shown to torture mice. The channel's name is MOUSE ARREST and if you just type that into the search bar then many other animal abuse channels appear. Some examples are Animal World TV and Glue Trap. I found these channels in 20s so there are undoubtedly many more. 

We've already removed one of these channels and we crashed the stock market. We can't let these channels continue to torture animals.

Everybody please report any channels you see abusing animals until they get removed. These sick fucks can only do it if they make money off of it. 

Please mention other channels you find in the comments and I urge everyone to report every channel mentioned in this post and the comments. If you read this far, thank you
