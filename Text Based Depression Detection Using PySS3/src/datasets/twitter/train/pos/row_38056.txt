Oh no Iâ€™m starting to have a new crush and I hate having a crush I will say how it started. I was Instagram and a girl from my school started a live thing so I joined. She did it with her twin sister and her friend. They would say to the people watching â€œask us questionsâ€ and â€œsay stuffâ€. So I did I said hey which me saying something is a big deal. So she said hey back and I have a class with her friend so she was like I know him (the girl doesnâ€™t really know me I donâ€™t her we ever had a class together and Iâ€™m quiet). So I was asking her and her fiend/sister some questions and I said ask me some also so they did. It went pretty well at least for me but now Iâ€™m starting to think about her like before I sleep and wake up and I donâ€™t want another crush. One reason is because I donâ€™t really see her so how can I talk to her another reason is I donâ€™t think she knows what I look like and the most important reason is that I canâ€™t talk to girls or anyone really. The same thing happens every time I have a crush, I like the girl I want to talk to her but I chicken out and if by some miracle I do, I make it kinda awkward and they donâ€™t have interest and if I try dming I always get ignored or dry replies so I donâ€™t want to do that. And because every time my crush is right there and I can talk to her but donâ€™t or they seem really uninterested as far as not wanting to be friends it makes me sad, really sad and maybe even depressed and since all my crushes were like this I donâ€™t like them. So idk if you have any advice on what I should do please tell me.
