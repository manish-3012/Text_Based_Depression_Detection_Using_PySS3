My dog died yesterdayâ€¦ He was a good boy. He lived for 10 great years and would always be there to greet you when you came home. Even though he was old he was still as energetic as a puppy. And i don't know what to do anymoreâ€¦ i don't have a dog to cuddle and snuggle with and life now just seems dull without him.
