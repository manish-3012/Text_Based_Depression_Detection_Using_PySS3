I HATE online school. Iâ€™m so done with this. And itâ€™s only been one situation. My Algebra teacher assigned a chapter one review online. I was like ok Iâ€™ll do it. So I start doing it and immediately start running into problems. Am I the only one that was taught that when their is a subtraction sign in front of a number itâ€™s negative? For example the equation x = 7 - 18 would be x = 7 + -18. So it would equal -25. The computer thinks it equals 11 cause they read the equation as x = 7 - +18. In my chemistry class she just makes videos to teach the class, even if your physically in the call. Like YOUR RIGHT THERE TEACH THE CLASS! I might be stupid idk it just makes me so mad.
