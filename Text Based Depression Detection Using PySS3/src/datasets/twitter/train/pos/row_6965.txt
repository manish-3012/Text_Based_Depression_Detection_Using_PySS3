Oh, what are my hobbies? (Yes I know nobody asked)

My hobbies include: 

Taking things too hard,

Ruining relationships I have with people,

Not trusting anybody for no reason,

And (trigger warning for eating disorders and the such) failing 4 times at making myself throw up. 

So fuck everything. I just donâ€™t want to do anything anymore. Itâ€™s all too much for me to handle.
