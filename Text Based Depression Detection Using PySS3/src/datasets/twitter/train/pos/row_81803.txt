How Life is so far in 2021 and my current thoughts on the state of the world So for those who donâ€™t want to read the full thing Iâ€™ll sum it up quick with this TL;DR 
1. After defending  a white kid from being harassed and being called a racist due to their parents political affiliation I was called a racist republican. 
2. After defending â€œmy strengthâ€/willpower in saying that stabbing a baby is wrong and saying that stabbing a baby in a nursery and abortion is NOT the same thing. He literally said it was OK to kill a baby and Iwas called a classic libtard 
Ok now for the long rant: 
Honestly i can see why whoever the fuck is up there gave us the virus cause at this point we as a species fucking suck. No offense to people from the U.S but your country is fucked. I literally watched a man not believe in covid cussing at a nurse for trying to save his life. Why. How? Did we come to this? Like what happened? Iâ€™m just very concerned on how things are going to go in the future. Plus im pretty sure this post will just get lost but to the 10 people who might see it I really hope you wouldnt call me weak minded from defending a white kid and saying that stabbing a baby is wrong
