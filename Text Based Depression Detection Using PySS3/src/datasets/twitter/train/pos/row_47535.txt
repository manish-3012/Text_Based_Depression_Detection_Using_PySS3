We need to fix Schools- General Argument 1; Schools inefficiently utilize time and resources.  

I'll go into detail in the following days, for today Iâ€™m going to be stating my generalized opinion. We know the routine. Get up, get ready, go to school, go home, do homework. After that, the schedule deviates to the individual. The part of our day where we all have a common routine is put bluntly, horrible. We go to school and we sit in classes to learn things, then we go home and do assignments about what we learned in class. Wait wait wait, hold up a second. So school gonna drag my ass out of bed unreasonably early five days a week, drag my ass to a place equipped for education, and then sit on my ass doing nothing but taking notes and listening for several hours. Then you're gonna tell me that school is going to send us home, a pace not equipped for education, to do the work that I could have done during the several hours of lectures I just had to listen to? I take that personally. Confused? Let me simplify. We have to spend part of our day at school, but instead of doing the work intended to be done at school, we have to listen to people tell us how to do that work and then we have to spend our own time doing it at home. I donâ€™t know about you, but I think that's some pretty bullshit way to spend your youth. Iâ€™m young and healthy, I want to run, to party, to explore and do the things I may never again do once my youth leaves me. But the reality is that here I am, stuck at my desk doing pointless, abusive busywork.

A lot of us are students and can  agree with firsthand experience that their respective education systems are flawed. We're all aware of the issue, itâ€™s time we come together to solve it.
