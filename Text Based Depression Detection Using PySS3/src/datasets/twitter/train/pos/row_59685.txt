do any of yâ€™all know if u can buy alcohol online if u have a debit card :/ bc like i have a debit card but my bank obviously knows iâ€™m not 21 so like will they block the order and/or alert my parents bc that would be a bummer to say the least. i would prob be using amazon?

note: sorry if this is against the rules? i didnâ€™t see anything about posting abt substances and i assume at least one person in this sub has personal experience with this
