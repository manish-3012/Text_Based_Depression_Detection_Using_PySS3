What's going on?? Ok so I took a break from Reddit for like *a few days*, except maybe to look at a couple trending posts. I come back on today and I see this entire subreddit has blown up about a 14 yo girl getting harrassed...? Wtf happened while I was gone?

I already knew there were pedos on here, but from what I've heard of the story, this is MUCH worse than I originally thought.

Before I start ranting about justice, does anyone have a link to the original post? It would really suck if this were all a shitty prank, or if parts of the story got fucked up along the way (parts of the story are unclear). I don't like to just take people's words for facts.

*I am NOT staying it didn't happen, I just can't find the original post. Did it get removed? And what's her username again?

#I just want to know the facts so I can join the protest.
