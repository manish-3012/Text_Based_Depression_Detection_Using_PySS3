Friends made a new voice channel And didn't invite me, they decided to do this with me in a vc with them. Who excludes one person in the friend group while that person is with them. Then they just started kicking me from the channel. They tried to hide it from me but I checked the audit logs and yeah they made a new one just for them. I guess they have a right to exclude me if they want  to. But at least do it with me while I'm not online.
