I'm disappointed in myself and the two people that I call friends. I've tried getting them to come to my house to meet my parents and they keep brushing it off (I know it's a bit weird but my parents want to get to know them) and I brought it up and one of them is now working double shifts at his job and dropped out of school to work and keeps saying he's about to move but never does. The other just said he might have covid, then he's helping to build a house and now he's going to Missouri. They both act like I'm a taxi driver but a free one. One won't get his high-school diploma and the other won't get a job and complains that he has no money. They both spend their money and never save it. 

I keep hanging out with them hoping that they'll change but they never do. I know it's wrong be i don't have the strength to move on.
