I have a very big brain plan for me and a friend So last Christmas I bought a laptop for $600 on sale, its retail price is $750. I want to sell it for around $500. This $500 would be enough for the parts i have yet to buy for a PC, as I already have a case and PSU. I'm 100% fine with buying some parts secondhand which I'll need to do.

I was planning on getting parts and building a PC with  Christmas money, but I might not have to do that now.

At Christmas I usually get ~$600. If this goes as planned, I won't need this $600 unless I decide I want to upgrade my PC, which I won't. So, I plan on putting this $600 together with however much money my friend gets for Christmas (probably won't be more than $200) and I'll put together his first PC.

He's never owned a computer capable of playing games, so this would be huge for him. I'm excited now; I want to start working on this and try to make this plan work out. We would finally be able to play games like GTA online together, which we've been wanting to do for ages.
