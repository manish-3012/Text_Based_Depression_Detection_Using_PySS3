I need advice from a female. Theres this girl on my social and she cute, i texted her like 2 days ago and she responded fast or whatever. We talked and i made her laugh but she was busy so i was on delivered until today when she remembered to text me back.

Im finna leave her on read until the next time i get the chance to talk to her but how do i get girls interested in me? I dont want to seem needy or desperate or anything. But then its so confusing. As a male im supposed to make the first move but then other people tell me that shes the one that should be chasing but how can i get her to make the move when she doesnt even know me like that? 

Help
