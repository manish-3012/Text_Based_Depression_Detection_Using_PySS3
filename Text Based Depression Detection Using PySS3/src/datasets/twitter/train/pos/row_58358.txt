So I have a problem Every time me and some people randomly find each other online we have a great 2-3 weeks chilling having fun playing on weekends.(not people I know in real life) playing video games then I decide fuck it and vanish forever. Yes Iâ€™m that person. Happened for the 5th time in 2 years cos quarantine. Is this ok should I keep doing it?
