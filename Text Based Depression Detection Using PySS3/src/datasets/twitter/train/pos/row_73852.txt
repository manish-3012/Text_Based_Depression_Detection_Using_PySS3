Does anyone know of any cool things you can do with an old phone? Because i was kinda hoping to use my old phone as a second screen for this one, or use it as a keyboard for this one, i dont know, also i have it overclocked ever so slightly, btw u can do that in devolper settings, or in the bootloader,


Also my old phone is the exact same as my current phone but with less storage,
