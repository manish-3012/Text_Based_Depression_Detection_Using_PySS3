Not being able to sleep is really, really fantastic, without a doubt. /s yeah so after a while of dealing with panic attacks (they come every night, last until sleep or morning) iâ€™m now just lying on the floor, listening to the same album on repeat, and trying to calm myself down. i donâ€™t even know why iâ€™m making this, but whatever itâ€™s just a small post so doesnâ€™t really matter anyway.

sorry for being crappy at writing, brain is slow atm.
