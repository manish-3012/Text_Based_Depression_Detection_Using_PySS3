Ugh ugh I ate wayyy too much food today and I want to cry I ate wayyyy too many calories and didnâ€™t burn enough off and I just want to cry ugh I donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™ve just been getting fatter and fatter because my mom and doctors have been forcing  me to eat so much but I just gain weight and eat way too much and my stomach is just ginormous right now and I feel so ugly and worthless and disgusting ugh I just want to be skinny and pretty thatâ€™s literally ALL I WANT but Iâ€™ll never get it
