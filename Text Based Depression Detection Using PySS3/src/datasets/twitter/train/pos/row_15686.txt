How long do crushes last I've had crushes that have lasted multiple years then I've fooled myself into thinking I liked other people for like a week or 2. I hate that I keep crushing on different people constantly lately. I mean I'll like someone but then once I get to know them I'll realize we don't really connect or we'll stop talking or whatever else. I just want to know I can find a person I genuinely like and connect with to fall in love with. I currently have a crush on this guy but I won't tell him cause I'm 3 and a half yrs younger than him so obviously it wouldn't be smart because it would just put him in an awkward position. Idk how long this crush will last but I don't just want to move on in 3 weeks and go crush on the next guy it genuinely bothers me and I have so many crushes
