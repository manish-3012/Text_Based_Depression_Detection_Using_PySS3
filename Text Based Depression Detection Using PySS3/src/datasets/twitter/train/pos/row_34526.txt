Anyone else have biased teachers? Either biased towards students or politically. 

My Journalism teacher is pretty politically biased. I mean, I don't care what your beliefs are but don't try and cement it into your class.

Back in middle school I had a teacher who was super chill (free days on Fridays), but always gave this one girl in our class As no matter how shitty her paper was. Idk what it was all she did was cry in the classroom closet during lunch.
