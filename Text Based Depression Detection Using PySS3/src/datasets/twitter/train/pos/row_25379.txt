i lost my roblox account from 2017 yesterday!!!! this account was my one and only account. It had all my friends, all my badges, games, chat convos, and i forgot the password. i contacted the roblox support group, and they dead-ass reset my account. i was locked out, i possibly lost all of my friends and badges, and i nearly cried. 

What can i do? i have made a similar account, but i donâ€™t think i will ever be able to get my other one back.
