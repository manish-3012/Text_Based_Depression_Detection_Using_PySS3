wow friendzone is weird i was friendzoned feels weird

hi !

me and my best friend have been flirting a lot. we almost dated. yet, he told one of my friends that he wouldn't go out with me.

i feel so weird, since all of our friends shipped us i really started to believe that he was actually interest in me.

i don't know how to feel and how i should react. plus i still am really attached to him and i might still have a crush on him i'm not sure

help me out lol
