Im sad with the lack of comunication with my girlfriend Its been 2 or so week and we only text, normaly we called everyday or everyother day, see each other on weekends but things in her life have been preventing that and im very sad as a result I hadnt realized how much I like hearing her voice. When comes to texting its distant as of late we message back and forth little bit then i send one more in the chain and 5 - 8 hour pass till i get a responce back, hell some times its untill the next day. She left small cules that its family trouble and when try to inquire,help or do something it brushed as she says i dont need to worry. Im sad as a result we text sparingly with hours in between I dont want to bring this up to because im afraid its another thing im gonna be adding on to her plate I dont know what to as my sadness seems irrational or clingy.
