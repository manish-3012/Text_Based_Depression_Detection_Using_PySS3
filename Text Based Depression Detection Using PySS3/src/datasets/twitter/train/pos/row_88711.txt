Help is this girl flirting with me(socially awkward introvert here) I was a a youth group meeting and a girl game up to me(a socially inept, awkward, introvert) and struck up a conversation. 

We talked for about 10 minutes, and in the course of conversation, we started talking about our workout routines. I mentioned that I like to swim laps, but my local pool just closed for the winter. She said that her neighborhood has a pool and if I wanted I could borrow her key. She also said her house is the only one in the neighborhood with a private pool, and I could go there if I wanted too. 

Later, I mentioned that I had just gotten my permit and I planned on getting a motorcycle once I got a full license. She said she'd ridden on her dad's motorcycle once before and she'd really like to try it again, then I said "maybe I can give you a ride" and she seemed really excited and said "yeah that'd be awesome!"

So is she flirting or just being nice, and if you're not sure, should I ask her out? Because if she says no, we're likely going to be seeing each other about twice a week, and it'd be really awkward.
