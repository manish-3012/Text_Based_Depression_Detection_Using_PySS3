I have realised whats wrong with me and I need advice with it. Basically towards the end of the week (Thursdays and Fridays) I would have waves of extreme sickness and therefore have to skip lessons (depending in the sicknesses intensity). Today I found out the reason I keep getting ill: Its because of how early I have had to get up.

I have experimented with this concept and its less about how early or late I go to bed and more about how early I have to wake up.

So is there any way I could stop this sickness. Please keep in mind that I cant just go to bed earlier since its more about how early I have to get up.

Thankyou.
