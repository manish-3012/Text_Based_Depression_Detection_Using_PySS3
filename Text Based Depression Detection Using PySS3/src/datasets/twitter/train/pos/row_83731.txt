What the fuck just happened Ok, a guy that i've known for maybe half a year now, just reached out to me and said that he likes me. Just so you know, I'm a dude. I do like this person a lot, but not really in a romantic way. But i wouldn't say it's a normal friend-like either. I can't put my finger on it, and I don't know what to respond. I haven't thought about me being gay before, but now im beginning to question my sexual orientation. Any tips?
