Not even a semester into online freshman year (high school), already depressed. Through all of middle and elementary school, I just got straight A's easily, no studying. Now, I just don't turn in assignments and get overwhelmed by 2 homework assignments. My grades are already plummeting, and I feel like I already peaked. I'm having thoughts of suicide, because I just want to spare myself from the next few years. I cannot tell if this would have happened during normal school, but people just couldn't wear masks. Oh well!
