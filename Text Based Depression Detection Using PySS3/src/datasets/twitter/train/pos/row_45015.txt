So we all have that innocent friend, right? So my innocent friend (Iâ€™ll call her Emma for the stories sake) and I were walking to lunch at school and talking, right? Well my comedic friend was with her other friends hanging out and Emma didnâ€™t have anyone to laugh with so I told her to give me a prompt and Iâ€™ll make up a pickup line or joke about that and she said taco. Immediately what came to my mind was, get ready for this, â€œAre you a taco shell? Because I wanna put my meat inside of youâ€ I was so sorry and now she said she hates me (jokingly). Weâ€™re both girls btw. I am so sorry if this has already been done but I just was laughing and apologizing waaaaaaaaay too much. My other friends did t want to hear what type of joke it was because she hates no one. Good day and I hope you got a laugh out of this.
