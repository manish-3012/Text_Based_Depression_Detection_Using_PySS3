No offense, but I think being trans is kinda stupid. There are only 2 genders.

no "switching genders". you either have a penis or vagina. I just get really ticked off when someone changes their gender because they feel like it.

You can act however you want, you can date whoever you want, but someone can't just change their gender because it's "the way you were supposed to be". You were supposed to have whatever gender you were born with!

and I know there are people with imbalanced hormones, but that's not really a good reason to change something about theirself. hormones just change the way you act. If someone changes their gender because they want to fit in with people that act a certain way, they're fueling the gender divide even more. Because they change their gender for that reason, they're basically confirming that only certain genders can do certain things and should act certain ways. If both genders are equal, then why would someone change their gender?

It doesn't really give any advantage, it doesn't get you out of any problems they are currently in, there is no strategical reason for changing genders.

that only leaves the last reason: "I change it because it's a personal choice"

Most likely you subconsciously correlate gender with doing things.

If you hang around girls a lot, you're might change your gender to a girl. That's because you want to identify as the people around you.

Technically, that's wrong, but I guess no one really cares so Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
