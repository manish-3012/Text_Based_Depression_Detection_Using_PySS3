The question â€˜do you wanna talk abt itâ€™ Does anyone also feels like the question â€˜do you wanna talk about it?â€™ is actually a very hard one? Like sometimes when people ask me that iâ€™m like yes but also no. Itâ€™s like yes i do but I donâ€™t wanna bother you and I donâ€™t know how to say it. So it mostly just truns out in a no I donâ€™t. But at the same time you do.
