I have the dumbest phobia perhaps in existence I have a severe case of Hauntophobia, or the fear of haunted houses. For me specifically, its the cheesy fake ones, i can handle the real stuff fine. You mighr be thinking "oh its understandable " but last year was the first year in my life i have EVER went through a haunted house with my eyes open, and it was the shitty one the school had set up. I've Bea to some pf the most haunted places around (etc, The Missouri State Penitentiary) and one of my hobbies is exploring abandoned buildings, but i cannot at all enter some tacky haunted house someone spent less than an hour setting up in their garage
