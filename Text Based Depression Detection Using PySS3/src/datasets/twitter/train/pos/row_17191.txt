A sad rant :( Hi everyone :) 

So recently my family decided to move to a different country (for various reasons) and at first I was 100% on board but now weâ€™re like 2 
months away from moving and Iâ€™m starting to just feel down about it all. Iâ€™m leaving behind whatâ€™s has been the last 9 years of my life... the dog I got for my birthday a few years ago, all the friends Iâ€™ve made through these years, the home Iâ€™ve lived in for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™ve finally found somewhere where I actually feel like I fit in and I know what Iâ€™m doing.. and... weâ€™re leaving it all behind. Tbh even tho moving is better for my family in terms of jobs and education and stuff, if I was given the choice I would definitely stay. Yeah I am also kind of looking forward to it and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll meet new people and make new friends but like these are the people who know me well and who I grew up with and I seriously feel like Iâ€™m never gonna find people like this again. :( anyways thanks for listening ig
