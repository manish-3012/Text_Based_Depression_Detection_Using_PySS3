Why are yall so ignorant and why is the automod so annoying? 

Why is it so hard for gen z to accept that there will always be people who wonâ€™t let you life your live, people who on purpose will say something racist/sexist/homophobe/transphobe just to get attention and get this sweet anger from their opposite. These are people you can not argue with because they donâ€™t want to argue or at least donâ€™t want a fair argument. It is completely useless to rage over a helicopter joke or to write a rant post about how mean everyone is. Sometimes it is just better to leave it and ignore these people because they are as provocative as you are gay/female/male/transphobe. There are some real issues trans people have in our society and there are some real issues everyone faces. 

Are you really gonna loose your temper over some stupid 13 year old on the internet who wanted exactly this reaction from you or can we all agree on ignoring these idiots just for the sake of peace?
