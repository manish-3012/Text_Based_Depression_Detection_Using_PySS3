Have you ever been labeled negatively? By negatively i mean the usual blanket terms. Homophobic, transphobic, Islamophobic, all that sort of stuff. I want to have a conversation on why you were labeled, because i find it extremely interesting.

If you do decide to engage, feel free to DM about it, or in the comments if you wanna discuss there. If you do DM me, it'll remain confidential. I genuinely want to talk if you were labeled.

And if you have ever labeled someone any of the above, do also contact me. I'm more than happy to talk about it.

I'll only answer to serious stuff. I'll dismiss all jokes.

Cheers!
