Someone needs to do this I had an idea that next time you're in an online class and get called on, just say 'sorry sir/miss my mic isn't working' then just stay silent and see what happens. I'm to scared to try it but I really wanna know what would happen. Please can someone with enough courage try this! If you do, please say what happened in the comments or take a video. I can't wait lmao
