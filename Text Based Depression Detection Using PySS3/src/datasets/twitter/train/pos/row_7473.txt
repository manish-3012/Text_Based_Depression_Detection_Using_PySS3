Back at it again So I used to be like super sad all the time and I felt worthless and everyone would be better off without me. Iâ€™ve almost killed myself more times then I can count but always stopped at the last minute. Then around summer I met new people and we had a great time Iâ€™d even go as far to say as last summer was the best time of my life and I felt happy for once and that was great. But ever since school started back up Iâ€™ve been sinking back into my pit of despair. My parents tell me every day their ashamed and disappointed in me and that they expect better BUT JM TRYING MY BEST AND IT MAKES ME SO FUCKING SAD IM TEARING UP JUST TYPING THIS. Itâ€™s so fucking stupid I hate school, school is the reason I feel so shitty Iâ€™m so god damn stressed out please someone help me feel better because I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of cutting again and I donâ€™t want to put myself or my mom through that again. Ok rant over ima go try not to cry now
