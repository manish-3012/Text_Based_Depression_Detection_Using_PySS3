I have a test in 15 mins I'm really worried and having a minor freakout about this test idk what to do and am just frantically reviewing notes. I've studied for about 3 hours yesterday and then two hours the day before because I really want to get good marks but I genuinely don't know if I can do well. Idk why I'm writing this I'm just stressed while your hear do you mind sharing any tips for calming down or like doing well idk man.
