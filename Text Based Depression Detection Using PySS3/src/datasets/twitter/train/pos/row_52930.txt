My day was so shitty Hi. I had such a shit day today at work, I was supposed to work from 11-4 and I got sent home at 12. So I cried for a little, then I got 6 doughnuts from Tim hortons and it is now almost 10pm and I ate 5 of them. So now I feel fat and ugly and I'm about to throw up bc I feel sick and also, my room is a mess so idk if I should clean it or not.

Yes or no?
