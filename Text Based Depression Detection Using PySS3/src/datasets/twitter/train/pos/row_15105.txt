Just don't bother with her You're in your room sitting In the dark thinking about her 90% of the time, thinking about your future with her whilst she's talking to another guy without even thinking of your name or even your existence

I know she's perfect to you and you can't imagine life with out her but just think about how you're always thinking about her and think about how many she though of you the past week

I hope you enjoyed..
