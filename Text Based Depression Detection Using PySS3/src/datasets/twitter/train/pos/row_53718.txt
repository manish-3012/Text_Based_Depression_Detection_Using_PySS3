Depression (not suicidal or anything, just really sad) 
Recently the past few months Iâ€™ve been really down in the dumps. Iâ€™m a shy, awkward, and self conscious loser. I have friends (doesnâ€™t feel like it) but Iâ€™m always in the back burner for all of them and none of them ever approach me to talk or anything, I always have to go up to them to talk and even when I do, itâ€™s almost as if Iâ€™m annoying them, itâ€™s probably in my head but I feel this way from their vibes. 2nd thing is the girl situation. I see all my friends I previously described talking with girls and being friends with them. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship before or ever had a girl bestie and I want an experience like that it looks fun and I feel like itâ€™ll be an unmatched experience with guys. I want a girl that I can talk to about my feelings openly and not be awkward or anything and have them approach me every once in awhile instead of me always going up to them, and I want them to be open with me to and joke around and everything, i know i probably wont get all those things if i ever do get a girl bestie. Iâ€™ve tried in the past with a few girls to try to get them to become my friends but they either show very abruptly that they donâ€™t wanna be my friend and they just be nice through the convo to not hurt my feelings or they are just super dry and clearly donâ€™t wanna be my friend either. I want to try again but I donâ€™t wanna get crushed again trying to make a friend. Iâ€™m just so insecure about my weight too I think everyone is staring at me and saying stuff like â€œhow is he so skinny?â€ Or â€œdoes he even eatâ€ I know these are probably in my head but the self consciousness leads to the awkward and shyness then that leads to me not having any girl besties. Iâ€™ve just been really down in the dumps and have been crying about it more than I should. So yea. I just wanted to say this in this subreddit just for maybe advice on what to do or something. Thanks.
