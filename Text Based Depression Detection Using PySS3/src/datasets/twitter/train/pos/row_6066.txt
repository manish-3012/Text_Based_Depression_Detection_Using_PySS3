[Rant] Are white people the only people allowed to have half decent parents? I fucking hate how everyone glorifies black, hispanic, asian, etc parents being abusive. It's not discipline. It's abuse.


I bet if those bastards came to live with my mom for one hour they'd be running out crying.


Forcing your kids into 1.32 billion extracurriculars, forbidding them from having dates, friends of the opposite gender, screaming bloody hell for the slightest mistakes, and BEATING them isn't good parenting and those people don't need to have kids.



If your kids don't speak to you when their adults, it's your fault. Nobody elses. You pushed them away.
