So I came out to a couple of friends today I have been struggling with this for months (and I am still struggling with it) but I decided today that I was ready to tell a small group of people that I'm, transgenderðŸŽ‰.  There are a lot of people in my life who would immediately cut ties with me if I told them (my family) but my friends were totally cool about it, if any of them read this I want them to know that I love them like family even if they don't feel the same about me.  I just wanted to put this out here for you guys to see. Anyway thanks for reading my short paragraph.
