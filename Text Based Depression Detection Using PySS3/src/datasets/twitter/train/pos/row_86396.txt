Dunno if itâ€™s the right subreddit or not but here it goes Iâ€™m a 17 yo who was raised in Russia but moved to US when I was 9. I was raised by ussr parents. They were not too strict, but my dad taught me one thing â€“ is to never show my emotions ever to anyone. I hate my dad for telling me that especially at such a young age. Right now Iâ€™m sitting on the balcony smoking a cigarette, completely crushed by everything that is going on, and I really want to cry right now, But I donâ€™t know how to. I can count on my hand how many times I have cried in my life and it was about five times and it was before I turn 12. Ever since then Iâ€™ve never cried even though I really want to so right now I am suffering from self harm not knowing how to relieve so many emotions. At this point of my life I donâ€™t know how to deal with my emotions. Everybody sees me as a tough 6â€3 Russian man nobody expects a tough Russian guy to cry of course, but I just canâ€™t take it man I donâ€™t care about everybody else I honestly could care less about my reputation or what people think about me I just want to be free of that baggage, and everybody assumes that Iâ€™m fine. I do not show emotions, I am most literally that Russian guy that you seen every American movie. My last girlfriend broke up with me because I couldnâ€™t show any emotions she thought that I was distancing from her even though I tried my best to show affection.I simply donâ€™t see my life beyond high school at this point I donâ€™t know what to do with my life I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen next. Peace
