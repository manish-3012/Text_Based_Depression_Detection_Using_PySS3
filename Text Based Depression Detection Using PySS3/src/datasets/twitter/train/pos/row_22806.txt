Confessed my feelings to my crush and got rejected But doing so rather than keep having a crush on him for who knows how long is way better. Realizing that if he isn't interested in me, he won't get interested to me in the future either. Not am I just saving time, I've also saved so much energy being wasted on chasing someone that won't chase you back.

It's better to open up much sooner than cementing your feelings for someone. Don't waste your time on someone who won't waste their time on you. Now life just goes on without losing much anything.

But neither will I cut connections to him since he's part of one of my social groups. Just returning back to normal and maybe feel awkward about it but in the end be ok about it. Only if he starts some drama over this, I know I've dodged a bullet for not getting together with him.

tl:dr confess your feelings towards someone early to save your time and energy
