How to talk to someone about mental health and wellbeing, from someone with mental illnesses: **TW: depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide**

*This is my opinion and experience. It differs with every person. This is not the gospel. What works for me might not work for others. This is what I have noticed tends to work best with the most amount of people*

A few weeks ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/hl3wrz/dear_all_teenage_boys_yes_even_you/) about general mental teenage health that garnered a lot of attention and support. If people are interested Iâ€™m going to write more about the topic, and things I think all people should know, whether or not you suffer. So, without further ado, I present:

How to talk to someone with mental illness about mental health (from someone with mental illnesses)

The most important thing to understand first, IMO, is that mental illness is not a choice. The science is complex (and super fucking interesting) but the TLDR is that there are lots of chemicals governing your emotions in your brain (happiness, hormones, sadness, joy), and mental illnesses are usually caused by an imbalance of them. This is measurable, medically treatable, and a fact. Mental illness is as much a choice as your height, gender, race, or sexuality is. This tips-which I follow on a daily basis is not only for people with diagnosed depression or anxiety. Itâ€™s how to talk to someone who needs support. Mental illness is a lonely fight, and having someone in your corner, supporting you, can be literally life-changing. Part of the shittiness of mental illness is that itâ€™s very individual. What works for some people wonâ€™t work for others, but this is what Iâ€™ve noticed usually helps me and others I talk to. I use the term â€˜mental illnessâ€™ instead of depression, anxiety, PTSD, or any other of the DSM (the "dictionary" of mental illnesses) terms. Mental illness is not a clean-cut diagnosis: for instance, I have diagnosed depression and anxiety, but take medication that helps people with bipolar type 2. Symptoms and actions across the definitions cross over plenty, and trying to box in someoneâ€™s struggles (especially if you're not a psychiatrist) is pointless.

Some things to avoid \~

* *Minimize their issues.* A friend of mine is fond of saying, *â€œGod only gives us the battles we can fightâ€*. Despite the fact Iâ€™m a staunch atheist, I do think that the challenges we face are over-comeable, but just because someone has it â€˜worseâ€™ or â€˜betterâ€™, doesnâ€™t necessarily mean theyâ€™re struggling more or less.
* *Tell them to snap out of it*. Mental illness is a long and difficult slog, and itâ€™s impossible just to â€˜decide to be happyâ€™. It's as impossible as "deciding" not to have a cold, or "deciding" not to have a broken arm.
* *Make it about you.* I try to avoid advice or things of that nature when talking to a friend in need. When Iâ€™m in a depressive episode or panic attack, I donâ€™t actually hear or listen to what youâ€™re saying. I hear your tone, body language, and expression.
* *Shit on normal treatment methods.* Even though something like therapy might not work for you, it might work for others. Donâ€™t blow off medication, psychiatry, or other treatments.

Good phrases/ actions \~

* "I'm here for you"
* "Come talk to me if you need me"
* Just a hug
* Spontaneous texts/memes
* "How are you doing?"
* "I love you"
* **listen, don't talk**
* open-ended questions are best  

   * Not just yes/no.
   * Urge them to open up, but don't push.
* Focus on breathing  

   * I use the [5-4-3-2-1](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/behavioral-health-partners/bhp-blog/april-2018/5-4-3-2-1-coping-technique-for-anxiety.aspx) coping mechanism during attacks, where you list five things you can see, four things you can touch, three you can year, two you can smell, and one you can taste.

Everything boils down to one core idea:\~\~\~\~\~ Support, donâ€™t guide \~\~\~\~\~

Unless someone *explicitly* asks for advice on something, it usually either just â€˜bounces offâ€™, or even makes someone feel unheard or unlistened to. Having support while fighting mental illness is an important tool, but at the end of the day, itâ€™s a solo fight. When it comes down to it, it doesnâ€™t truly matter how supportive and loving my friends are, itâ€™s just me and the great powerful beast of my depression, anxiety, and bipolar tendencies in the darkness of my mind. During those fights, none of my friends can help me. They canâ€™t stop the intrusive thoughts or the urge to self-harm. But I know I can call them, or talk to them. I know they can listen while I wrestle with it, be a shoulder to cry on. Sometimes, just being told Iâ€™m loved, having that affirmation in my mind, is enough to pull me out into the light. **You have to fight alone, but you don't need to** ***be*** **alone.**

A note about self-harm and suicide \~

In my opinion, self-harm and suicide are some of the most difficult conversations to have with someone, especially when talking about yourself. To be honest, I still donâ€™t know the right thing to do when a friend tells me theyâ€™re self-harming, or thinking about it. However, here are some things to know:

* *Scars*. Demanding to see them or calling attention to them is embarrassing. As someone with visible scars, it makes me super uncomfortable when someone asks about them. Especially if you know that the person in question is not actively self-harming anymore, calling it out (especially publicly) is pointless, and harmful if anything. Active wounds are a different issue (see below).
* *Contact*. If someone you know is threatening or is actively self-harming, going to a professional or adult (parent, administrator, family member, anyone trustworthy) can be a solid bet. Theyâ€™re happy to keep you anonymous. I've had to step forward to parents several times in the past, and while it's a difficult conversation to have, it's vital.
* *Threatening.* People (according to my therapist) who actively threaten suicide won't actually go through with it. However, if someone you know is threatening it, *please* sit down with them and have a conversation to find out if they're planning on hurting themselves. If they are, get help. [Some signs.](https://save.org/about-suicide/warning-signs-risk-factors-protective-factors/)
* *Why*. Honestly, I donâ€™t know. I still donâ€™t know. Asking usually gets no useful or real answer. "Why" isnâ€™t important, the next steps are.

Final words \~

Just because your friend or someone you know is struggling, that doesnâ€™t mean to forget about yourself. Sometimes, people try to â€˜offloadâ€™ their issues, trying to share the burden. It doesnâ€™t work, and only harms both parties. If you need space from someone, take it. Iâ€™ve had to leave behind friends who were using me as their personal therapist because it began to affect my mental health. Itâ€™s not selfish to put yourself first. Help others if youâ€™re able, but set aside the time you need for yourself. If talking and supporting your friendâ€™s mental health is hurting yours, take a step back with them.

In this post, I use "mental illness" and "mental health" interchangeably. However, they're pretty different things, but related. This is a clarification that I'm speaking about "emotional" mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and OCD. Mental "illness" also covers autism, attention disorders, Aspergers, and more.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully someone finds this useful! Please let me know if there's anything inaccurate or something I should addâ€”I'm happy to edit it after the fact. The posts keep dying in new, but hopefully, this one gets some attention.

If people like this one too, there are a few ideas I have for future posts: anxiety/panic attacks, more on self-harm, good practices for self-care, good things to read/consume, places to find help.
