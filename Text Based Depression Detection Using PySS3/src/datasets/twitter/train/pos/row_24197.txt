Start eating healthier! Trust me, it will be worth it and you will feel sooooo much better. If your thinking of going on a keto diet then i would recommend Dr. Berg (search him up on YT). Being healthy is the key to a good life, sure, you can indulge in a bit of candies every now and then but you should certainly start getting more nutrients and vitamins. If you have a symptom of any sort then i would recommend telling your doctor. Diabetes (Type 2, in specific) comes mainly from the stuff you eat, and the lifestyle you live, and it's symptoms can be very hard to spot, but they include excessive thirst, excessive urination, cravings for sugar, dry itchy skin etc. I hope this helped, have a nice life :)
