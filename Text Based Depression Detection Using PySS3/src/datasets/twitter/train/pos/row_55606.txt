help with social interactions iâ€™m not sure if this is a common issue amongst teens but personally i find it difficult to hold up social interactions, like just general conversations. iâ€™m a 15m and iâ€™m kind of quiet and i hate it. many conversations have met there demise due to me just not being able to say anything, and i wish to get better. most of the time iâ€™m laying in bed with my girlfriend i find the room stale and malnourished of lively conversation, and i know thatâ€™s not because of our relationship itself. iâ€™ve always found it difficult to just say SOMETHING or anything at all to spark up a good conversation and it kills me. what iâ€™m asking for is; how does on be â€œconversationalâ€ or just easy to talk with? i want to find the ease of talking that i see so many others succeed with
