I could use your help I know that no one will probably see this or care, but here goes nothing....

Basically, itâ€™s my dream to be a musician. I wonâ€™t bore you with the sappy stuff but

REGARDLESS

a friend of mine and I have released what is both of our first songs. Itâ€™s a collab, we are both proud of it. 

I could use some help getting it out there. 

Itâ€™s called Someone New by Ashley Delphine and Seth DeWitt. Itâ€™s available on iTunes, Spotify and Google Play. Every play and download counts, and every one makes my dream a step closer.

Thanks guys, and good night to you all.
