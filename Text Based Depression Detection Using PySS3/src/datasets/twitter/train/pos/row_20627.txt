Reddit mods are useless I got banned from reddit and r/pewdiepiesubmissions because I quoted something he said in on of his live (the"quote" contain the n-word btw)

I get banned for this kind of shit but peoples who directly try to scam people on reddit can get away with it, imo it's really dumb

if you want an example search the name u/Maplemoon
