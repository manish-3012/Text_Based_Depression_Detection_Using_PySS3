Can I ask for some help with school? I have to make this newsletter in one of my classes that can be about literally anything. 

Anything is  very large range. Video games, memes, the political compass, I have no clue. Mind giving me some suggestions? I don't care what they are, just something I can turn in for school. Thanks a lot!
