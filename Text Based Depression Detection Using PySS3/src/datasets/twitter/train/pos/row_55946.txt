Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 34: Bill Gates Bill Gates was the founder if Microsoft, pioneer if the Information Age, hige philanthropist, and the richest man on Earth for several years. How did he get so rich, though?

At one point, he was a technology advisor for Apple. Apple was designing Software, and they showed it to Gates. The same exact software was used in some of Microsoft's early computers.

To be fair, Gates, as advisor, suggested to Apple that they trademark their software, but they said no.

In 2001, Gates and Microsoft were accused by the government of monopolizing and restricting their competition. Congress looked into this in a case called *The United States vs. Microsoft*. Gates used the phrase "I don't recall" almost religiously while he testified before Congress. They appealed in favor of the United States.
