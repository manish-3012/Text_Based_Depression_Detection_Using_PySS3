The girl I like P.2 Went out for Ferragosto, an Italian holiday, for three days: Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I got to meet her and my friends again and I liked it alot She didnt seem to dislike hanging out with us. During the mornings and afternoons, me and my male friends went to the beach multiple times but she didnt come with us, from what I understood she preferred to stay because of one of my friends, a girl (which from now on Iâ€™ll call *Maria* not her real name), wasnt feeling so well. Also she felt like she could have been ignored while me and the boys were â€œhaving funâ€. We once again slept in tents and I only slept with her during mornings and afternoons as she stayed up late. She also looked around for me and flirted with me, at one point we even cuddled while she was not wearing her bra (why is that do all girls get rid of it during rest? Lemme know fellow girlredditors). Anyways I dont want to go in too deep, I had fun and thats all that matters. Now I asked her out for an evening out on our city and she asked if the others were the come, to that I answered I didnt ask, I was thinking of telling her something like â€œbut we dont have to do it if you feel uncomfortableâ€ but I stopped, she answered Itâ€™s cool and we will organize for going out to get a meal together.
