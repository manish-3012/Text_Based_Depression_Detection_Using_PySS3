Why do adults say this Like why is it anytime I try to talk about plans for the future or something I cant wait to be older for they respond with "life only gets worse from here" or "it only goes downhill from here" like bruh what's the point of living then like school is shitty and you want to tell me this is the best?? 

Idk I should probably sleep but had to put this out there
