Messy Christmas trees are better than neat ones 
One of my favorite parts of Christmas is decorating the tree. I just me and my fam just throw the tinsel, bulbs and lights everywhere and it looks beautiful. Neat trees are boring and they take too much effort. When I look at a messy tree I feel happy and when I look at a traditional neat tree with space between the bulbs and the tinsel I just get bored and walk away, the only thing that makes these trees look good are the lights but there are lights on every tree.
