Am i really that chaotic I mean i feel like im different from people around me sometimes i mean people at my school, im for example one of the very few that lives very far away from school, i dont play hockey like 99%, im pretty calm. 

I just never have a clear mind, thereâ€™s literally always something on my mind even when im sleeping. I sometimes think that im becoming crazy or something and some people call me chaotic and silent, i mean i dont show my emotions most of the time. One example is when i sat next to my old crush and we had a fight and i wanted to cry but I didnâ€™t.
