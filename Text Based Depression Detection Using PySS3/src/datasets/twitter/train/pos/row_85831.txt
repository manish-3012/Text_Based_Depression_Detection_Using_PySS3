im genuinely concerned for this person so earlier this year, during quarantine, i (15M) met this dude (9M) on a minecraft server and we became friends. We played together for months after that. He had a youtube channel and a discord. Two months ago tho, he told me about how he was crushing on a female leaderboard player on the server who was 13, and how he wanted to ask her out. About a week later, he did just that on discord, and got rejected. He told me about how he was gutted, and he had even set his status message to the most depressing shit, he seemed depressed af. Fast forward to a few weeks later (the last time i met him), when apparently he has a 16 YR OLD GF, and hes talking about wanting to have sex (not normal for a 9 yr old ik). I thought it was him being weird like always, but the next day, he blocked me on discord, when our relationship was going perfectly smoothly. Today, i remembered him and did a quick search through my subscribers, but i didnt see his channel anywhere. Im srsly concerned for him, he was a great friend :(
