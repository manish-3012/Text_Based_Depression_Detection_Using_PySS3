Holy fuck! Can people show a little participation in online classes! Every time a teacher asks a question. People go quiet and force the teacher to:

A: Call on random people

B:  Have a awkward silence.

I get that you might not know the answer but show a little respect to your teachers.

They usually put a lot of effort into their presentations.

(This only applies to people that sit silently for no reason.)

Edit: Social anxiety is a valid reason. I think their should be an option to opt out of participation if you have it.
