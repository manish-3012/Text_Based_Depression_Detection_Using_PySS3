Dude I think I just had a heart attack! So its like 3 am here and Iâ€™m chilling in bed playing Legend of Zelda and listening to music and at this point the only people still up are me and my dad. And all of a sudden my grandma who lives in our downstairs apartment has a hallucination/nightmare and like gives me a heart attack. Anyways not really sure why I am posting this but I just felt like sharing.
