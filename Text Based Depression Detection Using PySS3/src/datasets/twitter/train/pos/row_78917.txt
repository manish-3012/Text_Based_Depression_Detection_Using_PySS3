Any tips to stop drinking so much soda? Now I'm not fat, and considering how much soda I drink, I really should be. I'm addicted to soda and it's just done the worse for me, I have bad acne, it's hard to maintain white teeth, It makes me get chubby so I realized it's just better that I stop now before it becomes a life long thing.

In case you were wondering, it's either coke or mtn dew.
