Help me to stop my phone Hi hi hi so here I am I'm a French student

And I have a big problem, not a really important one but it's really strange
I'm studying in a class called Classe PrÃ©paratoire aux grande Ã©coles you can search for it it's a sort of equivalent for university and all
And I have like a lot lot big lot of work
But I'm still
Always
All the time
On my phone
I don't understand why I keep being on it and not working even though I know I HAVE to work bc I've a lot to do
Please help, give me advices, and not just "turn it off lol" I can't and I need music but like maybe it's a problem of focus and concentration Idk I'm lost

Sorry for my English :)
