smells like... birthday cake... hey guys! today is my birthday and i just wanted to come out and celebrate it on reddit too! i'm turning 16 today and it feels weird...

i now have the ability to get a job and drive! it's only a matter of time until i get to drink which is a little scary... god, this feels like a dream! 

anyways, i just wanted to put this out there for anyone who might care. i hope you guys have an amazing day!
