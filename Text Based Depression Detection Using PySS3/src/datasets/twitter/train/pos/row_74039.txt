My schoolâ€™s sex Ed class is useless I am so annoyed at the sex Ed program at my high school. I go to an Australian catholic school and we where told that our grade ten classes would be the first to get a sexually education class in the schools history. None of us where really excited for it of course but it should have happened long ago. All the misconceptions about sex that I have heard through the school shows that it was a very needed class as well. Unfortunately the school system had to fail us again and when we walked into class I saw that the unit title was â€œrespectful relationships from a Christian point of view.â€ They arenâ€™t even going to teach us about safe sex, itâ€™s abstinence only. We have kids banging behind the greenhouse and taking pregnancy tests in the bathroom and yet they didnâ€™t think that a proper sex education class would be beneficial to the students. More than there quarters of all the students are atheists so the catholic â€your all going to go to hell for having sex before marriageâ€ speech doesnâ€™t work. The school system needs to step up their game instead of trying to cover up all the teen pregnancy that are happening. I really just wanted to rant about it
