how can i convinced my parents to let me get a job? thereâ€™s a lot of fast food places in my area that are hiring yet my parents wonâ€™t let me apply. iâ€™m a teenager that needs money, i donâ€™t see a problem with me needing a job. these places are literally in walking distance to my house. iâ€™d obviously be wearing a mask the entire time. idk if itâ€™s a weird they have a problem with me growing up thing or a genuine safety concern.  idk what i should do.
