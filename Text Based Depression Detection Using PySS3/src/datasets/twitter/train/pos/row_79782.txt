I'm going to try to be less socially awkward starting off with interacting more with my cousins

it's going to be tough since all of them are like full-grown adults lmao but they are nice people

i don't get how my siblings can talk to them just fine when they are teenagers as well.

it's going to be tough trying to be less awkward though because once they look at my way, i immediately look down at my phone or on the ground or something. idk why i do that.

but i can maintain conversations if someone approaches me first.
