Steve in smash t this isnâ€™t really the subreddit for this but there is a rant tag so Iâ€™m gonna use it to rant, something has been bothering me lately I see all these people complaining about Steve being in smash with all these bullshit arguments but the on Iâ€™ve seen the most is â€œheâ€™s too new/modern of a character to be in smashâ€ and because I canâ€™t find anywhere to talk about this shit mindset Iâ€™ll talk about it here. Steve is literally from 2009 heâ€™s older than the past 3 smash broâ€™s he was literally created during Nintendoâ€™s wii era. character think of the characters and franchises currently in smash heâ€™s older than 4/7 of the past dlc characters heâ€™s older than the majority of newcomers in the past 3 games (Sakurai considers 3ds and Wii U as separate games) and heâ€™s older than a lot of franchises in smash such as splatoon, he was created before skyward sword, Mario galaxy 2, the xenoblade series, punchout wii, kirbyâ€™s return to dreamland, etc. I still donâ€™t understand why people make the â€œheâ€™s too newâ€ argument when all the PokÃ©mon added in the past 3 games are younger than him. Feel free to discuss with me on this as you will, Iâ€™ll be willing to take up any argument.
