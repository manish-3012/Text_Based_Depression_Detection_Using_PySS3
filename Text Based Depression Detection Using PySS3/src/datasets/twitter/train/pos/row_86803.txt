I don't know what to do, help. I think my crush and long time friend is ignoring me. I have sent  a message on both discord and messenger but she hasn't answered for almost a week. I don't want to seem clingy so I haven't sent any more messages but as she has sent answered u don't know what to do. I have seen her using her phone at school so she probably hasn't missed them so I think she is ignoring me.

And to top it of I am really insecure and anxious all the time. I don't really have anything to look forward to in life other than being with her. I have been drifting away from the few friends I have becuse I am not allowed to play any of the games that they play becuse my parents think they are "to violent". I don't feel like anyone would care for more than a month if I disappeared. I just want someone to care about me.

I don't know what to do, please help.

PS I am not a native English speaker and I am now going to sleep so sry for bad grammar and I won't see any messages for a while.


Please help
