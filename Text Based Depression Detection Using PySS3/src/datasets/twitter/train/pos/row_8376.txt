I lost 7kg (15 pounds)! So 3 weeks earlier, I was weighting 86 kg (Around 190 pounds) and today I checked and now I weight 79 kg (Around 175 pounds). Like I did almost nothing to lose my weight, I just went to the dormitory and because I am poor AF, I reduced the amount of junk food I was eating, and in 3 weeks, I lost 7 kg, maybe it isn't much, but it's still something. That is just a little accomplishment I wanted to share with you.
