Anyone else get mad when they hear the word TikTok Like I'm just minding my own bizness, until one of my cringe normie classmates mention TikTok . I then proceeded to tell them why TikTok is normie cringe meant for low iq individuals , and why reddit is better because of wholesome keanu . 

They made fun of me , which was complete uncalled for . They called me obese , but little do they know , I'm a heckin chonker .
