During the month of August, I listened to 1,056 songs that were posted to Reddit by independent musicians. Whenever I ran into one that blew me away, I added it to this playlist! Iâ€™d love to share them here with anyone interested.  Hey everyone, I spent the past month listening to music posted to reddit by independent artists. I found a few hidden gems that I would love to share with you guys. I have them separated by platform. Each platform has artists that are unique to it, but it also has some of the same ones. The reason is that some of these musicians only upload music to one platform. I hope you guys enjoy the music, and thanks for giving these musicians a shot!
