I just found out I saved my friends life. Today we were in English and we were watching a documentary about how social media affects us and it went to the topic of suicide. My friend mustered up the courage to tell everyone that hes cut himself before. He said that me and our friends saved him by just being there for him. I didnâ€™t realize how much being this close to losing a friend felt and itâ€™s the worst feeling Iâ€™ve ever felt in my life and Iâ€™ve been through some shit. You may not think your friends are suicidal but please even if thereâ€™s a slight chance or signals PLEASE make them feel loved. I know this seems like another karma whore post but I promise you itâ€™s not. PLEASE and I BEG you please check on your friends because you may not get as lucky as me. If youâ€™re going thinking about self-harm or suicide please talk to your friends or a trusted adult or call 1-800-273-8255. Your friends and family love you so much even if you donâ€™t realize it.
