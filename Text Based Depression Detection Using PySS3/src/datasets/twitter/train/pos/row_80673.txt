Common misconceptions about MGTOW that I would like to debunk. 1. **MGTOW is a sexist movement full of incels!**

But that is simply not the case. An Incel is someone who wants to have sex, but simply does not. MGTOW is when you can have sex, but simply won't. Of course we have a few bad apples but those guys aren't MGTOW because they actually want a girlfriend. We really are not attempting to be sexist, just because you saw some sexist post on r/MGTOW does not mean we are entirely a group of sexists. We can have female friends the whole point of MGTOW is to find yourself as a better person, and not to get caught up in constantly shooting for a SO by changing who you are.

2. **MGTOW are selfish!**

It is not selfish to care and make yourself a better person. If anything that's the opposite of being selfish, because making yourself better is helping not only you, but the people around you. We simply do not want to have an SO and just focus on out own betterment.

3. **MGTOW are just the male form of a cat lady!**

I'd heavily disagree with this point. A cat lady is someone who would loves her cats and stays at home with her cats all day. MGTOW are people who are bettering their lives and improving themselves. Cat ladies are defeated women, MGTOW are anything but.

4. **MGTOW are generalising women! Not every woman is a gold digger!**

I would not call it generalising. A good example would be a company with a bad reputation, not all of their products are good, not all of their products are bad. However, you have bought their product or heard stories about their product that made them seem really bad. Instead of buying that product in the first place, or doing it again, you simply do not want to take your chances anymore. Its not like *all* the products are bad, you just have decided no longer to buy it.

This is not a propaganda post. I am not saying to GYOW. All I am saying is that maybe MGTOW are not the type of people you thing they are. Also, women can GTOW as well.
