My past self just pranked me A few weeks ago I tried to scare my mom with a plastic spider. It landed up in my cat's bed. Today i was cleaning the cat bed and i flipped over the pillow and nearly shat myself (I have arachnophobia). There the spider was, waiting to scare me! It was actually pretty funny afterwards tho.
