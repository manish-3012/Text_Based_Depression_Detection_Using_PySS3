Spotify just gave me severe emotional whiplash I was listening to Spotify reccomend playlist on shuffle and the song [Stay alive reprise](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ydKgIVZAQXeYLWtxU8DFS?si=Qncgzu0iR0CCQppM-vueAg) played and I was feeling sad because of it then immediately after [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3pMsqOoZTtzUiZXmDVtrCD?si=tjF4o7mYQyaPCZjK5EvKcw) started playing. 

Emotional whiplash from sad deathðŸ˜¢ to like dancingðŸ’ƒ
