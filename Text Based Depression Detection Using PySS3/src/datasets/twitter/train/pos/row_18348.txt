Anyone willing to take a quick survey for my class? Good evening everyone. I am doing a field observation for my college class and I needed some people to answer just a few simple questions. The questions are basically just asking what movie you would prefer and why, and then asks for some information regarding age and school level. I would appreciate a broad range of ages so anyone is welcome to take this survey and if you have a younger/older sibling in school that would not mind taking it as well it would be a tremendous help. Thanks everyone!
