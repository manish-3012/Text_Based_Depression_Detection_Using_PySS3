Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 11 Day 11:

So today Iâ€™m reviewing tomatoes. I like tomatoes they are nice, but the whole â€œtomatoes are fruits not vegetablesâ€ is honestly the equivalent of â€œiM nOt LikE oTHeR giRLsâ€ but for foods... just stfu like last time I checked I didnâ€™t put them in my freaking fruit salad, I put them in the same salad that I put the other VEGETABLES. Also cherry tomatoes are much better, *dont @ me.* So yeah Iâ€™m gonna give tomatoes an overall score of 6/10

Anyways I hope you a lovely day guys &lt;3
