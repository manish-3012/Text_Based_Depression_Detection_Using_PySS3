Our Dog passed away As I'm writing this, our puppy, named Mango, sadly passed away due to poisoning. 

She only turned a year old a month ago, and it's heartbreaking to see a dog pass away again so early.

The vets kept her alive for many hours, as my dad rushed there, only to see her close her eyes.

Rest in peace Mango â¤â¤â¤
