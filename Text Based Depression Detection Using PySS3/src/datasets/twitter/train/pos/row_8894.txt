Ok so my view on menâ€™s vs womenâ€™s rights (in the us and other western 1st world countries at least) So I saw the post about rights women have but men donâ€™t and I wanted to expand the list and show the other side

Menâ€™s major downsides: emotional inequality, higher suicide rate, forced into parenthood where as a woman has a choice (in most areas), child custody battles rarely being won, higher rates of workplace death, and the fucking draft, sexual objectification (if they are hot,) 

Womenâ€™s: Periods, emotional dismissal as sheâ€™s just on her period, higher depression and self harm rate, in some areas also donâ€™t have control over parenthood cause of illegal abortions, less physical stature to defend themselves, higher threat of rape, sexual objectification (if they arenâ€™t incredibly ugly)

Actually looks like it equals out a lot I must say

This is not counting areas like the Middle East, just the western world
