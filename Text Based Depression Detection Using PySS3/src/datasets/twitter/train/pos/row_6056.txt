Advice on getting drunk for the first time This may sound a bit vanilla or jokey or whatever but I got properly hammered for the first time ever last  night at 18. Overall the experience was enjoyable but I thought I'd share some tips from the experience as underage drinking is very common these days.

Definitely do it in the company of adults and in a safe place. Amongst friends in a field is a very very bad idea.

Make sure the majority of people there have experience being drunk so they know recovery mechanisms or how to deal with you should something go wrong.

Make sure you have multiple options for sleep, so that should you not be able to return home there are other options - be it a friend's house or whatever. 

That's the major points out of the way, if I think of anything else during my current recovery I'll update this later.
