Who the fuck thought the compliment â€œYouâ€™re so badâ€ and every variation of it was a good idea? I wouldnâ€™t call myself socially inept by any means but this shit breaks my brain like what, Iâ€™m dancing with this girl and she tells me â€œyouâ€™re so bad rnâ€ like damn sis, you didnâ€™t have to put me down when Iâ€™m doing alright. 

Canâ€™t people use normal compliments?
