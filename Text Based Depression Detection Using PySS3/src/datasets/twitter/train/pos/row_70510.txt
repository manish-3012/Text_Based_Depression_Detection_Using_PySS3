trying to find an alternative to self harm well my parents took my blades. ive been feeling horrible lately. im off ssris, recently go broken up with lol. i feel weird i guess. ive been thinking of piercing my septum as an alternative to self harm. i dont like hurting myself. i feel like if i pierce something on my body i would feel better. At least im getting something pretty out of the pain Iâ€™ll feel.
