Conservation of mass energy is paradoxical If we are right that the expansion rate of the universe accelerates, and that so-called dark energy causes it. Then there would have to be a source of infinite dark energy to cause the expansion to constantly accelerate. If the "big crunch theory" is correct, then the expansion rate would be decelerating.
