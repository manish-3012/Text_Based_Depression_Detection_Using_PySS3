Sand bread! You guys need to try this. Replace your flour, salt, and sugar with sand. Then make a loaf of bread and boom. You have sand bread. Itâ€™s very nice with some tomato slices. But when ever I eat it in public I get a bunch of weird looks from people. They tell me things like â€œSTOP EATING BRICKSâ€ or â€œNO I DONT WANT TO EAT YOUR BRICKâ€ smh so rude.
