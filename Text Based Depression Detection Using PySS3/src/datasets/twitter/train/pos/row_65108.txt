So apparently I gave someone over 10 awards on accident I was trying to check what awards I've given and received over my time in Reddit, and today, I decided to give someone an award, because, well, the person deserved it for a big accomplishment. So I decided to give a silver, but it didn't let me. I kept spamming it, but it didn't work. So I tried other awards but it still didn't work. So I gave up. Anyway, I checked today what I've given, and it said I gave her 4 Silver awards and 7 community awards, with my 100 Reddit coins gone. I really overdid it, and if you got a crap ton of awards from me (I'm not putting her name out there just for privacy reasons) I'm sorry if I creeped you out or anything like that. Take it as a late Christmas present I guess
