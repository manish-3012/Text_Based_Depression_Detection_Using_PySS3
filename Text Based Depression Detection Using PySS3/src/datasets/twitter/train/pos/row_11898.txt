Mitras has some words of wisdom for the boys I keep seeing these "Can't find a girlfriend" titles, and I want to say something about it.

Stop putting girls on a pedestal. They're not necessary to enjoy happiness. YOU'RE necessary to enjoy yourself, a girl isn't gonna do that for you.

Of course they're great to have, but they don't make you a person, you do that. So enjoy yourself and be in love with yourself before you try to find someone else, cause if the do that, the rest will follow through.
