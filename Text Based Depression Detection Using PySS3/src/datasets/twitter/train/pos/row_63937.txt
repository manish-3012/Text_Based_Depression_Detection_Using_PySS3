can mental illness be genetic ? my grandpa hung himself, my uncle shot himself, my aunt doesnâ€™t have to work because sheâ€™s too mentally ill, and my cousin is schizophrenic.

iâ€™m not saying iâ€™m suicidal and i know that iâ€™m not schizophrenic, but i constantly feel like shit, and sometimes these feelings are so overwhelming that they make me feel nauseous or nearly pass out. i cry almost every hour.

should i see a doctor especially with my familyâ€™s history? iâ€™m worried to tell my dad because it was his dad and brother that killed themselves and i donâ€™t want him to worry about me
