Anyone else seriously considering not going to college? Iâ€™ve been thinking for a while and Iâ€™m really not sure if I want to or not. I have no clue what I want to do in the sense of a traditional career. My passion is for creating/writing, I want to work on a business or write a book and become a famous author. On top of that I really hate school with a driving passion, I donâ€™t know if I could endure 4 more years of it. Plus college is ridiculously expensive, if college was cheap I would surely go but itâ€™s not.

My only reason for wanting to go to college is to meet people and have a social life, other than that I know I can achieve my purpose without it, I really donâ€™t know what to do tbh.

Any of you in the same boat?
