Why must this happen to me Ok so here is something that happend today:

Some time ago I finally had the courage to dm my crush if she wanted to do something. She actually said yes so I was VERY happy!! We talked on dm a bit and also on school. We hit of pretty well so I thought: "holy shit maybe I am gonna get a girlfriend!!!" One of our classes got cancelled today so in that period I asked if I could go to the mall with her and her friends. She said yes so i was very happy (again yes). it was really fun so i liked that. She plays minecraft so i asked when we're home to play minecraft together. That also was really fun but I remeber seeing on her tiktok and talking in class about being gay or something. So then i asked to her: "are you actually gay?" She responded: "yes"
