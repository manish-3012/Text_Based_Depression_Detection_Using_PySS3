Why does everything bad happen to me? I feel like giving up. I donâ€™t have any reason not to. This isnâ€™t about suicide or anything. I just want to give up on life. I canâ€™t seem to get a break for more than a couple days before another big bad thing happens to me. I thought yesterday would be different. I thought I could just relax and spend Valentineâ€™s Day with my gf. We went to the mall, this group of boys followed us around for about an hour. We noticed and decided to get food in a crowded area to lose them. My gf had to use the restroom and as she went into the hallway to the restrooms the group of boys followed her in. I ran in, didnâ€™t grab my mask and because of that I was stopped and couldnâ€™t help her. She hasnâ€™t told me what happened yet. But I know it was bad. Idk what to do.
