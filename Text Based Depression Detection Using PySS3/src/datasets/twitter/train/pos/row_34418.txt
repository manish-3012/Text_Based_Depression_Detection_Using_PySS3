Storytime: I groped a shemale by accident once Now before I start this off, I'd like to say that neither I nor any of my friends in the story are homophobic even though we are from a Muslim country, we're just neutral on the subject because picking either side could potentially ruin family and wordly relations for us. Hope yall understand.

This happened late last year, I was hanging out with my friends outside our academy (which is basically 4 more hours of school) so it was like 7 pm. Beggary and shit like that are super common here, and alot of trans/shemale people do it too. So we're chatting infront of our academy and my friends suddenly go dead silent. Now me being the half blind fuck I am with my back turned to what they saw that made them go silent stay oblivious to whats happening. I literally had no idea and then BOOM they all book it. I still had no idea what was happening when I felt a breath of the back of my neck. Out of reflex, I turn around with my hands near my chest palms facing forward... baaad idea. I grabbed onto something... Now, I'm like 50% blind with alot of focusing problems so it takes a few seconds for me to realise tf is happening and what I'm looking at. I'm towering over a baby faced shemale in a blue dress... and I have my hands on their tits... and, uh, the fuck they're... smiling...? I think... this is how people get gang raped...

FUCK RUN

...goes my brain and I just run. I'd never interacted with a shemale before so that was a first for me, the media here and the enviroment has painted a pretty bad image of them in our mind so I guess this had to be expected of me.

The shemales in that area and me are cool now they dance for you for 5$.

tl;dr: accidentally groped a shemale because I'm blind
