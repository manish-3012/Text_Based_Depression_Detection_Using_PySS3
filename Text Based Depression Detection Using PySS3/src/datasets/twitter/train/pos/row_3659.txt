I fear that my Trust Issues will ruin my relationship. Iâ€™m 16 and in July I met the girl that would become my girlfriend in October, I believe sheâ€™s the love of my life, we have already started talking about getting a flat together and going to the same uni in a couple of years and itâ€™s amazing! But I have really bad trust issues and it affects the way I see her sometimes. It really hurts because I do truly love her. Ever since the first few weeks we met.

When she tells me nice things I find it hard to believe that she actually means it and that she doesnâ€™t actually want to be with me and recently Iâ€™ve been suspecting she has been seeing my best friend behind my back, without any evidence. Sheâ€™s not the type to do such a thing but those thoughts canâ€™t leave my brain.

 He asked her out sometime in August but she declined but later I began to see that she took an interest in him but then stopped after a while. I was always the side friend Iâ€™d say. In September and October we began seeing each other more in uni and soon I found out she liked me all along and it just started from there.

We have regularly been discussing it and she know about all of my suspicions and worries and she always tells me that Iâ€™m being stupid and paranoid and that I should see a therapist because she wants to be with me as much as I do, she says. 

Thatâ€™s the context, Iâ€™d like to find out everyone elseâ€™s opinion and advice if thatâ€™s ok. Feel free to criticise me, anything might help.

Iâ€™m really struggling with this.
