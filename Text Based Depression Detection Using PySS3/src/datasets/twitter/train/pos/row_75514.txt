L8r Sk8rs With my last 15 minutes of being a teen, I just wanna day thank you to the three people who might see this in new. This subreddit has given me a lot of great laughs over the years as well as show me that sometimes youâ€™re not the only way feeling the way that you are. No matter how alone you might feel, youâ€™ve got a great community here. Never stop being the way you are. Ever.

Farewell, teens.

Old, here I come.
