Omfg I did something AMAZING!!!! So I was told to record and edit a video of my shop class so the next students can understand what it is all about. Guess what music I use for the video. That's right the main tf2 theme! I credited the value studio orchestra (obviously). But that's not all! Is getting added to the school Facebook page, omfg tf2 is my life at this point.
