We are our memories Everything that matters is just a memory 

All the great moments you ever had with others, all the friendships and bonds youâ€™ve ever had that matter are events that you both remember the same way 

And if memories are just the way that your mind interprets these events, then nothing is real

Donâ€™t dwell on your past, because it isnâ€™t even real.
