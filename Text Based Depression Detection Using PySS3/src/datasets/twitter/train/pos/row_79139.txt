Do you ever catch a whiff of a smell and think why tf am I smelling this? This smell shouldn't be here Ik it may sound kinda weird, but hear me out

I'm just chillin in my room, it's 2:30 pm and I'm watching a stream, when suddenly I feel this smell fill my room up, and it's a familiar smell, it's kinda caramel-like, people from my home country (Argentina) may understand if I say that it smells like "pralinÃ©" or "garrapiÃ±ada", if you don't know what it is, it's a sweet treat that is made (I think) by heating up sugar at an almost caramel level and throwing in some peanuts, what you get is basically crunchier peanuts that taste like sugar, amazing. This whole thing is weird cuz it's 2am, who tf is making sweets at 2 in the morning?







And yes, ik that Argentina is not the only place with pralinÃ©, but it's pretty common here, specially in my province, but not in the part of my province that I'm right now
