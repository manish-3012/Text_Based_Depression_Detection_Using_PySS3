Should I break up with my girlfriend? I used to like her a ton especially when we first started our relationship. But the thing is I just donâ€™t feel close to her anymore. 

She says she is busy all the time with work and school which I respect, I donâ€™t want her to stop everything to hang out with me. But at the same time arenâ€™t you supposed to treat your boyfriend like a PRIORITY? 

Iâ€™ve been struggling so hard not being able to see her but now I just feel lifeless. It seems like she doesnâ€™t care about me, she never texts, never hangs out at school unless I initiate. We have hung out outside of school twice in 3 months! 

This is causing me more emotional pain then when I was just crushing on her. She just isnâ€™t the person I thought she was. 

What the hell do I say to her??
