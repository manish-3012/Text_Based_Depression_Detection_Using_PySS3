If I make a joke And the person I made the joke at is completely fine with it, and knows it was a joke and isnâ€™t hurt. I hate people who come in a get offended for the other person even though the joke wasnâ€™t targeted at them.

Like I swear to god that pisses me off so much 

Like I at my school we were doing a wilding out, like a roasting session where we make fun of each other. I was telling a story about how a guy said to a girl â€œyour ass looks like 2 deflated basketballsâ€, it was a joke and everyone was okay with it, but since itâ€™s a woman thatâ€™s being made fun of itâ€™s â€œbody shamingâ€ â€œsexual harassmentâ€ etc, I got comments saying I was the asshole and I was sexually harassing her, 

#when I didnâ€™t even make the joke, I was just watching them

She was okay with it too, but people in my comments still wanna call me the asshole 

This is why I hate a lot of the people on Reddit, especially the little kids here yâ€™all are so sensitive and cry over everything, (not all just the sensitive snowflakes)
