I got myself into a difficult situation even though it wasnâ€™t difficult in the first place For cultural arts class we had to make an art autobiography. Not so difficult right. Yeah you are right it really isnâ€™t. So I wrote down like two books, three musicals/theater performances I saw and like 10 really good movies I really like.

I really like watching and analyzing movies and movie scripts. This wouldnâ€™t surprise you then, but I want to become a movie director myself. My cultural arts teachers walks up to me and looks at what Iâ€™ve done and says: â€˜I see you like films. Interesting selection of movies. A lot of classics I see.â€™

For the assignment we also had to write down what art related thing we wanted to do in the future. I asked if I could write down the fact I wanted to become a movie director. He then asked if I already made a short film and I answered no, because I havenâ€™t had time to do that and since like 6 months I have a good phone with a great camera, but filming during COVID-19 isnâ€™t the best thing to do. 

Out of nowhere he said: â€˜when everyone has to make a report you ARE going to film a short movie.â€™ Now I fricking regret telling him that I wanted to become a movie director because even though filming a movie sound like fun, being graded on it while having literally no experience in filming and screenwriting there is so much pressure and this grade is part of my exam. I fricking regret having a conversation with a teacher.
