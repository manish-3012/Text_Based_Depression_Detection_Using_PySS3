Youâ€™ve spent all your time trying to get a girlfriend but what happens after that? This is just a random thought but I know that some of the people here have probably lived their entire teenage life trying to get a girlfriend, (you know who you are) my question is what happens after you succeed and wether youâ€™ve considered that fact.
