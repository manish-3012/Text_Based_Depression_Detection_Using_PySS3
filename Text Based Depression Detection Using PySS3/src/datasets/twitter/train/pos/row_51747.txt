Maintainable Weight Loss for a Teen Hi everyone!

I was already slightly overweight for a 16 year old girl, but after quarantine (eating a lot tbh), I gained some more. I am certainly not at a weight that concerns my doctor (she's said as much), but I want to address my weight before it becomes a problem.

Does anyone have advice for being more conscious of what I eat without driving myself crazy and binging on takeout?
