How do I start a conversation with a girl that I like but I don't really know? Last year I moved to a new town. I didn't know anybody and was pretty lonely for the start of the year, but this girl was always nice to me and I started to really like her. Cause of covid I couldn't get to know her or anybody a ton and Im pretty lonely right now. It would be really nice if any of you could help me start a conversation with her.
Keep in mind I really don't know any thing about her. 

Sorry for bad English it's not my native language.
