tw rape one of my friends got raped and i dont know how to help them. one of my friends (under the age of consent) has oral sex with a guy (reached the age of consent) and my friend got pressured by the guy into doing it. she never gave a 100% yes but the guy did it anyways. she is still kind of horrified from the experience and sheâ€™s been having nightmares since the experience. sheâ€™s never told this to anyone for a month since itâ€™s happened and sheâ€™s only told me, since sex is a very huge taboo topic in her culture. up until now, she hasnâ€™t realised that sheâ€™s been raped until i made her realise it. she canâ€™t get actual help from a counsellor or anything in fear that her conservative parents would be informed about this and be very very mad at her. i really want to help her but i dont know how.
