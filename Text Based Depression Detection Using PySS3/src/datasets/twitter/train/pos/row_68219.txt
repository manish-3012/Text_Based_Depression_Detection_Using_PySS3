I think I'm the only one who is very different from the rest of my family members I'm already on a different education pathway than what my other family members have went through

and now they are hoping that I could get into a local university and yes I know that is a better choice for my future but honestly, I don't mind not getting into one and start working right after I get my diploma but man, I don't know...

I might still stick to the University route eventually
