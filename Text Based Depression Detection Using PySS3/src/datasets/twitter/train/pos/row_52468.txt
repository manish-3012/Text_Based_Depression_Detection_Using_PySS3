Letâ€™s not forget little kids like Secoriea Turner These violent protests are starting to wear me down. Innocent kids are starting to get shot down n shit in America. I donâ€™t know how far this message is gonna spread, but if any of you are thinking of taking to the streets with a gun, think twice. An innocent girl like [Secoriea Turner](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/05/us/atlanta-shootings-secoriea-turner-rayshard-brooks/index.html) could be killed. She isnâ€™t the only child dead. This shit is fucked. Remember to keep these protests peaceful. Donâ€™t let yourself get worked up.
