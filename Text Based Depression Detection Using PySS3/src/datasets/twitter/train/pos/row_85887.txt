I have to really think about what Iâ€™m gonna say to try and start a conversation (Also fuck texting I only use it to spread information not just to talk). So right now Iâ€™m trying to talk to this girl I met through my friends gf and itâ€™s been a struggle. Iâ€™ve been trying to start up a conversation but nothing seems to stick for very long. How do I make it so that we can actually have a conversation
