i wish other people in my family owned cats or dogs I have like 30 cousins, a million 2nd &amp; 3rd cousins and like 12 aunts and uncles, and NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY PETS. Like, HOW?? Nearly all my classmates have at least 1 family member that has a pet. I'm the only one in my family that genuinely loves animals. I can understand some of my cousins' living situation to being unable to own pets but what about my rich cousins?
