I have fucking survied Covid19 and i will be happy for the rest of my life three weeks ago i've had a very high fever and my body was burning for two days and i was coughing for three days while i was sick, i would become weak, have a sore throat, have trouble breathing.
i've clearly thought it was a regular fever. After two and a half weeks my body temperature started cooling down and my coughing wasn't so bad.
This whole fucking time i was lying in bed and i've had no idea i've contracted such a dangerous sickness.
i don't want a reward or karma but i am happy that my life has been saved.
