Dude ngl, I wanna be Markie Mark I'm really inspired by the big tech companies, cause they can get away with blatant corruption and no one will say anything. Someday I wanna create my own big tech company, buy out politicians, and use them to get whatever I want. If I can't make it into art, I guess I'll be america's dictator.
