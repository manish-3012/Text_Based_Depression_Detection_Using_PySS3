Reviewing Dutch Pat and Mat episode 2 I will not have a consistent scedule for these, so maybe sometime I won't have some for 3 days and then I'll do two in one day


This episode is already much better than episode one  The writing is funnier, they wear hats and they have some very nice music. This is truly the start of the good episodes. 

Oh and they are also swearing a lot which was worth pointing out, like they said god damnit and jesus a lot which was quite odd for a kids tv show in the 80s where even then there were way more religious people. 

This episode also always used to scare me when I was like 3 for some reason lol. I always hated it when the goulash appeared.

Edit: oh yeah and in this episode they put wallpaper or their house
