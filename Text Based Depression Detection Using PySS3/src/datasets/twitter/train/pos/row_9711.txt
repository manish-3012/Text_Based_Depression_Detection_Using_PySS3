I quit Islam Serious thing, my heart is actually beating as I write this. Iâ€™m still scared and noone will ever know in my life about this. But I worked up the courage to break free!

I feel so compelete. Itâ€™s fine to believe in what you want to believe in but I felt like itâ€™s so controlling and after reading 1984 it troubled me how similar some aspects were.

I can now  listen to music, support lgbt (well technically Islam isnâ€™t against it but majority of Muslims are), watch movies during sunset and go to the cinema and shake hands with a girl.

Iâ€™m complete.
