I just saw something that forever changed me as a man A police officer stopped a teen black male that wasn't doing anything wrong.
The cop told him that his tie wasn't tied correctly, the teen told him that he was on his way to a date and never learned how to do it propperly as he is an orphan, the police officer steps out of his car, re-does the young males tie, and tells him he looks nice, the look on that teens face as he thanks the officer gave me hope that life is full of good people.
