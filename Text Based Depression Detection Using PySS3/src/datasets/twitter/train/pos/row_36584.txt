I feel lonely Iâ€™m the youngest child and all of my siblings are off and married so itâ€™s only me and my parents at home. I hardly see them outside of dinner though so Iâ€™ve pretty much been entirely by myself for the past 6 months (outside of work).

Idk, I just want to be a part of something again
