My mum won't buy Nike's anymore, here's the stupid reason. So you guys know the lil nas X music video, and about the she's with blood in them? They're Nike's, and she's a Christian. She says I'm never buying Nike again because they did something demonic with a celebrity. Honestly this is the dumbest shit I've ever heard, Nike even said they had nothing to do with the shoes. I don't think it's about the demons tbh, I think it's because LNX is gay. Ugh, homophobia.
