This is too all the people (strangers and friends) who made me smile in 2020 THANK YOU!!! I mostly won't know you but you won't know me either, but there were moments (TONS of them) this year which inspired me, motivated me, and just made me smile and be happy during all the stuff happening this year. This year is just been crazy, one thing happening after another. I, well, am easily influenced by stuff and the overall mood of the people I hanged out with was bad so I tend to be gloomy all the time. There was a whole month during lockdown in which I did nothing except eat, study, school, YouTube. Hearing people not only on this subreddit but others helped me realise what I could do and made me stop thinking about what I couldn't do. Some of the posts were rants and others pictures but they still did help me.So basically what I am trying say is *Thanks a lot* everyone.

TL;DR: Thanks to all of you for unknowingly help a teenage boy smile during tough times. I am usually complemented for my smile which is always on my face but this time you guys put it there. Also Merry Christmas (Thought this was the best time to post this)
