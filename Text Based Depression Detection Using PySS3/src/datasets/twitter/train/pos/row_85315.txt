Does anyone else have multiple friend groups and feel weird when those groups mix together I would say I have like 4 or 5 different friend groups because of sports, church, school, and just straight up homies. Sometimes I feel kinda awkward when some people from one group hangout with people from another one of those groups. Some combinations are clearly worse than others. It might just be that I can act very different around each one of those groups and my mind malfunctions trying to think of how to act but it's still weird to me. Anyone else like this at all?
