I've been struggling with my mental health I (15 F) have been struggling with depression and overall poor mental health for the past few weeks. I've been withdrawn from my friends and family, and I've lost all motivation to do anything. I used to hang out or at least talk with my friends once every two days or so, but I haven't seen them in about a week and a half. My friends and I are incredibly close, so this has been really hard for me. School has really been kicking me while I'm down, too. I have overdue assignments, and I can't seem to think at all. My head feels like it's filled with cement and my chest feels heavy all the time. I constantly feel like I'm on the verge of tears, but I can't cry. I feel like I can't continue, I can't do it anymore. I used to be able to power through it in a day or so, but I've got nothing left anymore. Any advice or kind words would be much appreciated :)
