Thinking of ditching career day today. Well for some reason we have career day today and it's online, fucking great ðŸ˜. Wish we canceled it for 2 career days next year.
Recently I thought of ditching it by just checking in my 1st period and just never entering a career day room ever.  
I think we also check in into other classes, but whose to say I can't just check in them. Also you might be asking me about a check list to see if you didn't ditch but last year they didn't check that list for mine and I didn't get in trouble which led to me believe I can get away with it.

I May still go be to afraid, but I have done worse in the last couple of months. It's possible I only join like 2 or 3 classes, the ones I enjoy and just ditch. 
My school Life has really gone downhill hasn't it.
