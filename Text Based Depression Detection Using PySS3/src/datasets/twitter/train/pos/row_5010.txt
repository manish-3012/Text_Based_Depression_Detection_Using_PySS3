Day 6 of my weight loss Day 6 is here. Almost the end of week one and Iâ€™m seeing decent progress for the first week. Anyways hereâ€™s day 6.

Breakfast: None. (woke up to late)

Lunch: School cheeseburger with Mayo and ketchup.

Supper: Egg breakfast sandwich.

Physical Activity: I had an after school orchestra event so I couldnâ€™t do much. When I got home I followed a 15 minute calorie burn video. Thatâ€™s basically it.

Notes: I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I lose a little over three pounds this week and now Iâ€™m gaining weight. Iâ€™m not going to give up but I need to actually start a routine of diet and exercise.

Starting weight: 158 lbs

Todayâ€™s weight: 156.2 lbs

Goal weight: 125 lbs
