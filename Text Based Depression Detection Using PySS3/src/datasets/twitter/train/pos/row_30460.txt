So, one year. I've finally done it, one year on this fuccin wasteland of a website. out of all the terrible memes and awful posts I've seen, yall have been the best of it. thanks for that. Anyways, I'm off to listen to the same song on repeat for 20 minutes and eat cake like this is an actual milestone, later!
