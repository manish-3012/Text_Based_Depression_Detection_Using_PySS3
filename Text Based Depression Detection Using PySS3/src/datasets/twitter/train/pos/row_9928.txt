I dont know how to make good friends. Long story short I've had a shitty time growing up as most of my "friends" basically just pitied me and more or less saw me as some pet they had to put up with.  


My latest friend group just ditched me seemingly out of nowhere. They said I make them uncomfortable but never have told me this and still won't go into specifics. It hurts as I thought some of them were cool and were fine with me. I don't expect to be best friends with everyone I meet and I understand not every friendship works. But when I'm constantly being told I'm the problem, yet not what specifically is the problem about me, I get depressed that it's just me as a whole. Like my existence just bothers everyone. I was doing fine mentally, but I wish I was never born. Life just doesn't feel like it's worth it, especially if the few things that it worth it reject me.  


I just want to learn how to make good friends. I was always the odd one out and just gave up trying most of the time. I'm so alone and can't even have a pet in my college dorm to keep me happy.  


I don't care about pointless karma, just please help me. How does everyone else do it seemingly so easy?
