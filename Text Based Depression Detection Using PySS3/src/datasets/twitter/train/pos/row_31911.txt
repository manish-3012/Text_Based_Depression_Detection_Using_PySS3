iâ€™m happy! iâ€™ve had a horrible 2020 (not just for covid related reasons) and my depression/anxiety  has made it hard for me to stay positive. but iâ€™m happy right now!

i have three close friends who i love and cherish as family, i have two siblings, a dad, and a stepmom who are always there for me, and some cute ass puppies who are spoiled little bundles of energy and happiness. itâ€™s nice, and i feel so grateful.

itâ€™s also been nine months since iâ€™ve self harmed. iâ€™m so much healthier than i thought i could ever be. life is finally worth living again, which is nice.

all in all, this year has sucked big time. but iâ€™m happy right now, and thatâ€™s all that matters to me.
