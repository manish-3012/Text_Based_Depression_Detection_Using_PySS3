just gonna move on iâ€™ve been crushing on this girl for a while and weâ€™ve actually had been close. I thought she felt the same way about me until i found out she had sex with this other person. I was hurt. She even said â€œi love youâ€. Iâ€™ve decided to let that part of her go, until i saw her kissing another guy on snap. I feel like i should just give up and find someone that doesnâ€™t leave me on delivered and doesnâ€™t have relationships with people.
