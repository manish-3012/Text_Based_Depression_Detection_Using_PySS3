Helpful Christmas tips from me to you: 1. Bigger is not always better. Sometimes the best gifts are in the smallest packages, so do not be upset if your gift is not the huge box in the corner addressed to your little brother.

2. A gift that rattles when you shake it is NOT always Lego. Just...donâ€™t get to excited.

3. If it is a big box, when you pick it up, tilt it. If the center of mass changes, itâ€™s probably a â€œRussian nesting dollâ€ box, and there is a fake weight inside.

4. Check to see if your parents start recording you while you open the gift. If they do, youâ€™re about to get something gooood.

5. Stockings are the most underrated part of Christmas morning. I mean, itâ€™s all just candy and crap, but it tastes good. The socks that you also get in there will probably come in handy too.

6. Finally, thank the person who got you the gift. Mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle. Doesnâ€™t matter. Give them a big hug and smile. This, in turn, will put you on their favorites list for next year, essentially getting you more gifts.

I hope these tips and tricks serve you well, and donâ€™t forget- itâ€™s all just a corporate scheme for money!

Have a Merry Christmas everyone!
