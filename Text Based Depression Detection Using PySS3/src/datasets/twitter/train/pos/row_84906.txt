What should I do? I have a crush on a girl who goes to the same school as me. We are in the same grade but she goes to another class, however we went to the same IT class. I sent her a friend request on Facebook about 4 month ago and she accepted it right away about an hour later after I sent it. 

I am socally awkard, introverted and really anxious about most stuff especially stuff including talking to new people. I want to chat with her but IDK that's a good idea or not. Maybe she wants to chat with me first but I goof up like I always do or she doesn't even want to chat with me at all. And I also have a feeling that she would find it creepy or weird that a half-stranger is starting a conversation with her on her social media.

I had really bad experince in the past, but I don't want to be alone forever.

What should I do or should I even do anything?
