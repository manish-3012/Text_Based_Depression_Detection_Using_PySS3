I'm going to join the military to get away from my toxic family. So last night, my sister said that "men are useless." This is by no means an uncommon occurrence as I am the only male in a home with three females (my mom and two sisters). My two sisters regularly say things like " Men are trash" And "I wouldn't expect you to understand because you're a man" and other scummy shit like that with little to no rebuttal from my mom. The double standards are also annoying as fuck and I have voiced my dislike for them and have been shot down. So, instead of my original plan of securing a job and saving up to get my own place, I am going to join the military. I just gotta get through one more school year since my ma wouldn't sign for me when I asked. I cannot stress enough how much pain comes from living in this household and I'm sure my mental health is suffering because of it.

My bad for this long ass post.
