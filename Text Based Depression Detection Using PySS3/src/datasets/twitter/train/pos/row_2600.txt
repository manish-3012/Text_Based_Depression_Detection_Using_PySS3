I have an issue and I canâ€™t help it So basically, I have a problem with gals. I canâ€™t help myself see a pretty girl and slide into her dms and talk to them. Now, at first look that may not be seen as an issue, but the issue is that i do that waaay too often in short period of time- which is bad because I canâ€™t help flirting with them all. 

I donâ€™t like the fact that they catch feelings because of that flirting because I know eventually Iâ€™ll have to reject them. I donâ€™t wish to reject them, but I just canâ€™t pick between the few that start catching feelings for me. Theyâ€™re all great in their own ways and I hate that Iâ€™m like this. 

I just need help on how to stop myself from being like this.
