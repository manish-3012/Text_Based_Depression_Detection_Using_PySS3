Hello Fellow Teenagers, Iâ€™m having an existential crisis and learning a life lesson from it. I dunno why, but in the middle of global history, I started thinking. And then I thought some more, and now Iâ€™d like to share some wisdom with you other teenagers.

Humans are destined to die. Call me a pessimist or whatever, but itâ€™s true, weather your feel comfortable admitting it or not, we all die eventually. And thatâ€™s okay, because most of our times come when weâ€™re ready. I mean, take cartoon shows for example, Iâ€™m sure lots of you remember having that favorite show as a kid, but eventually, all good things come to an end. And thatâ€™s also okay, itâ€™s things like that that makes us. And eventually, weather itâ€™s all your shows are done, or your favorite video game franchise comes to a close, itâ€™s those experiences we need to take from it. Itâ€™s like going to a theme park, or on a vacation, it ends eventually, but itâ€™s those memories that defines who we are in the end. To wrap this all up, weather your depressed, happy, or neutral, be you. Donâ€™t be afraid to show people who you are. Because you are unique, you are beautiful.
