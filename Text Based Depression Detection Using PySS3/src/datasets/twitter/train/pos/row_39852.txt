Nuclear Everything Workshop Hello fellow redditors,

I am hosting a 4 day free workshop on nuclear engineering. Topic discussed involve: nuclear energy, nuclear radioactivity, nuclear medicine, and much more. I will be having guest speakers from MIT's Nuclear Science and Energy department and NCSU's Nuclear Engineering department.

The dates are August 11, 13, 17, and 19 from 12 - 1 PM EST and the attendance is through zoom meetings. You must sign up in order to attend, and I would love to have more of us attend and learn about Nuclear Engineering from the experts themselves. You also get a certificate of attendance.  
Sign up here: [https://forms.gle/kGcysXN84wd2uDQ29](https://forms.gle/kGcysXN84wd2uDQ29)

Thank you all.
