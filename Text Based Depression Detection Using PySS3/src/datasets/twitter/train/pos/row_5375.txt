first post here in a long time, idk what to say This isnt some dumb meme, I just want to ask what is it like to be normal?

You all are so different to me, and I wish I could be normal. I used to be like you all too, I want to forget the past but thats not how it works, I am who I am now. I know that this post is probably hyper-cringe but I just want to sincerely know how I can be normal, and what its like.
