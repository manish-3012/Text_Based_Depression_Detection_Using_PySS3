My closest friend just got dumped by her bf I tried talking to her and giving her some advice, and she said I made her feel better alot, but I've never actually been in a relationship so idk how to deal with breakups. Is there anything I could do for her to make her feel better?

If you want more context or follow my posts, [this is the girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jc4w37/theres_this_one_girl_whos_showing_me_affection/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [this is the guy](http://tps://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j9ko9q/russian_kid_tries_to_convince_me_homophobia_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I really care for her and want to make her feel better. Any advice?
