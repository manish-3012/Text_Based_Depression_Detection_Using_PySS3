I send a message to my crush and told her i loved her Sorry for bad english, it's not my first language.

I'm a straight 15 years old boy, and i have a crush on a 16 yo girl for almost a year. I love everything about her, and I finally got the courage to tell her I love her. Obviously, she said she didn't liked me that way, but that we could still be good friends, but I don't know how to talk to her the next time i see her. What should I do?
