I think my geography teacher got fired. Apparently he did a thing during Thursday's class, and now students in the class are getting calls, being asked what happened. The teacher's not in class today. The worst I heard was him using the F-word while the mic was when talking to another teacher 15 minutes after the class normally ends (we were having a test and I get extra time because of my IEP). Though, I wasn't paying attention to the context of the swearing.
