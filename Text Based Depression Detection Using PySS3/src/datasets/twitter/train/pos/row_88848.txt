Hello fellow kids! We need your input. Are you a Youtuber, TikTokker or otherwise content creator? We want to create, in essence, a coworking/IRL connection space for media makers! ðŸ“·

Hello!

Ever have an idea that you think is awesome but aren't sure if other people actually want to *pay* for it? That's what we're trying to figure out! [We're conducting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s_7lx0uewJoVnELBq_78NQddTCW5ZXrSzKCEgL2Lwq8/prefill) some preliminary market research on a concept that's, in essence, a coworking space and IRL community for media content creators!

This includes:

* Youtubers
* Podcasters
* Livestreamers
* Film and Television Creators
* Editors
* TikTok'ers
* Other Media Creators

[Our survey can be found here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s_7lx0uewJoVnELBq_78NQddTCW5ZXrSzKCEgL2Lwq8/prefill), and we sincerely appreciate your time and consideration! It's totally anonymous, however if you'd like to leave your email, we'll provide a discount for you when we officially launch!

Not only do I think this idea is something I genuinely would enjoy myself, but I also see it bringing some life back into the city post-COVID 19. Help me out with the blind spots! Thank you everyone.
