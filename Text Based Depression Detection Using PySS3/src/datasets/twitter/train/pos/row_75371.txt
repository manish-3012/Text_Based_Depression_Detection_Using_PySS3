Eyyy I got a valve index I got an HTC vive a few years ago, and in the summer I replaced the controllers with those of the valve index, cause mine were starting to break and also the index controllers are better.

So for Christmas I asked for a graphics card, but obviously stock shortages meant I'd get it late, so my dad basically get one if you can find one, but they're wx MSRP now cause tarriffs, so I talked to him and I got an index instead, and it got here today, and it's so amazing, I love it
