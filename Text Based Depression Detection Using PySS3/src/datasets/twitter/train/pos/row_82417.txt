I am a socially awkward teenage boy who needs strangers advice on the internet I feel uncomfortable talking about this to strangers on the internet but I have a crush on this girl in one of my classes I basically know nothing about her but her name and appearance because I haven't talked to her much but I know she finds me funny because of her laughing at jokes she hears when I'm talking to my friends and when I'm screaming for whatever reason she always responds by screaming back with a screaming contest that she finds funny I guess but I don't know how to start a actual conversation with her without making it uncomfortable or just freaking out mid conversation and having to tag in my friends to help and I just think is is really cute and just wanna know more about her and really get to know her but I just don't know how to approach the situation and see if she really likes me too.
