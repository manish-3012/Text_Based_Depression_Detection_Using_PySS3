Why does it have to be this way So about a month or 2 ago my brother broke my Ps4 controller and i have to wait til yesterday to get one that i paid for and you know i wasnt going to let him use it. I also pay the the Ps plus subscription so i can play modern warfare and other games and my mom said no one else was able to touch my controller (big suprise since she never defends anything i do or say) and so i was eating my breakfast this morning and hear my brother back in my room beating on my controller so i went back there and took it from him, he then proceeds to try and delete his account off the console (the only one the ps plus would work on and idk why) but he was trying to so i unplugged the power cord and now im probably about to get an entire new ass chewed because i was defending stuff i worked for and yes,i know thats only like 96 dollars or something but thats kind of alot to me. But so help me if i am about to get in trouble for this im moving in with my dad. Atleast he wouldn't chew me out for wanting to keep something
