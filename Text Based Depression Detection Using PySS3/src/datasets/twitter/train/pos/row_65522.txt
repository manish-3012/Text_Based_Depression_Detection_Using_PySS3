My laptop surprise attacked me and put an update button right where I clicked. I am in the middle of class and now I am waiting here as my laptop restarts for the past half hour. Thatâ€™s always fun. Itâ€™s not like I wanted to be there for class. What a great way to start my first class of the week. Better yet itâ€™s the class I also happen to be failing. So anyways how are your days going?
