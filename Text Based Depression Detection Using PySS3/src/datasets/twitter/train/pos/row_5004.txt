google meet is stupid af like I come onto this for my second hour and I hit the camera off button before you go off to join (as I'm pretty sure 99.9% of this sub does) and this button turned off my camera in the join meeting screen and it DIDNT FUCCIN WORK. This threw me into the meeting with my camera on. I cannot physically express how much I did not enjoy that experience
