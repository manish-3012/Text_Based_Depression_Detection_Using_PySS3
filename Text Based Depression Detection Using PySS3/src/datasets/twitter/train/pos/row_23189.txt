I lost my two best friends I don't know what to do. For some backstory, I'm (M16) a junior in high school and I have had these two friends let's call Dave (M16) and Billy (M17) that I have known since I could barely walk. We had been through everything together. Up until this past year we were inseparable. Nothing got in between us and even if it did, we would talk it out and move on. But something changed. The past few months have been rough for me due to my mom having surgery and my stepdad being deployed. I have felt alone and they seemed to be the only people there for me. Up until 2 months ago when I met my gf. She is incredible and has shown me who I can really trust. This is where things change. Billy stopped including me in stuff. He would hang out with Dave and others without even letting me know what plans they had. Whenever I would confront him about it he would say that "oh just talk to me next time and we'll do something" only to change plans on me the moment that I ask to hang out. So I decided enough was enough. I cut him off. I told him that what he was doing wasn't cool and that I didn't feel like me staying was good for my mental health. My gf said the same thing. Dave is a narcissist who always seems to get into trouble and only seemed to keep me around to get him out of it since I am (or was) the responsible one in our friend group. I cut him off about 2 weeks ago. This past week has been rough because our other friend Josh also blocked me with no explanation. Dave doesn't check in on me and I don't know what to do. I have always had good friends and now that I don't I feel alone. And I'm not doing this for awards or anything like that. I legit am in a tough spot and I don't know what to do. If any of my fellow teenagers have any advice, I am all ears &lt;3
