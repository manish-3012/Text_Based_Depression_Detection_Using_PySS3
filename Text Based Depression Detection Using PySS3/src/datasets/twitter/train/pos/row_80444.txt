I need help in a discussion My friend and me are having a discussion about moral standards that guide your decisions. They are saying that they feel like doing good for others or not harming other animals (like annoying insects) when most people would, because you feel good while doing it or would feel bad if you did harm them, is still selfish and therefore bad, since you're doing or not doing these things because it makes YOU feel good or would make YOU feel bad.

I am aware that this is really backwards logic, but I am really struggling to find a way to show them that. Can you guys help? Thanks in advance
