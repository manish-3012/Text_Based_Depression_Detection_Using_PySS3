Is it normal to feel super-detatched from your parents? Idk why but I feel super detached from my parents and I don't understand why. It feels like growing up in a stranger's house.

I'm a 15yo boy and I didn't feel that way when I was younger. I always loved my parents and we had an amazing relationship. But around when I got 13 everything shifted. My whole world flipped and I completely disconnected from my parents. Everything I do with them just feels ... -weird.

Idk if that's normal but I also don't feel like talking to them about it would make it better. And I don't think I would even bring able to bring it up bc it literally feels like talking to strangers and I don't have the courage to talk with my parents about such stuff anyways.

I'm not good at talking to people, that's why I'm posting this on reddit.

Is this normal?
