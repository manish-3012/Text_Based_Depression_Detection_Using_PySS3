I just got perma banned from r/memes The post: https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/k8wj9i/do_it_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf 

I donâ€™t know what I did wrong. They say I broke rule 3 which is about spamming. Iâ€™ve only posted it once. I have to wait a month till I can appeal but I donâ€™t know what I did. Can someone explain?
