Why do stomach bugs exist? Why must I sit here, wallowing in pain?

Why must I feel a pain, like a rhino slamming into me, just every few minutes?

Why must I sit here, fat lumps sore from sitting for hours?

Do you know what time it is? 

I want to sleep, please.

Just when I think itâ€™s over that rhino comes stomping back just to hit me while I am down. 

I want to cry.

Itâ€™s 4:00 in the morning. I should be asleep by now. I should be dreaming whatever my brain comes up with.

Instead here I am, browsing reddit to keep what small sanity I have left.

You there, yes you. Why are you here? Why are you reading my post, while I am shaking in fear?

Does sleep exist?

Oh god here comes the rhino again.

I better have a massive gain in luck to make up for this.

I just want to sleep....

It hits me when I am down. Just to laugh at me while I am crouching in pain. Just when I think itâ€™s all over, I can finally go to sleep, it comes and asks for my lunch money. 

I donâ€™t want to believe itâ€™s food poisoning. I had my motherâ€™s cooking, she hadnâ€™t poisoned me ever. If I tell her I am up so late because the rhino of stomach pains kept me up would she feel bad?

So tired.

What did I do in my past lifetime to deserve this?

I curse at you stomach, capable of dissolving any food with your acid, yet you get so feisty when itâ€™s something you dislike. 

Someone fix this bug in the next patch.

I want to sleep.
