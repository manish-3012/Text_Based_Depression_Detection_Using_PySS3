I went to sleep normally but I woke up in the middle of the night naked. I'm seriously confused rn. My clothes were beside my right leg. I don't think anyone in my house would do this. I do have some kind of sleep walking kinda thing if I know that I will wake up early tomorrow so maybe that was it. I was gonna wake up early. But I don't think I would've stripped in my sleep. I would've just moved around a lot. But yea this is weird. It's 1:21 AM. I'll try to answer some comments before going back to sleep so yea. 

Thank you!
