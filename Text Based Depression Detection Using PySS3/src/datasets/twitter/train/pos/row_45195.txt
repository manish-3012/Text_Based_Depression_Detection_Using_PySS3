we did it boys aight now that I caught your attention, I just wanna say that you matter, your life has value, if you ever feel down, try talking to somebody, or me, I'll keep my PM's open, and I will answer as many people as possible.
If you're having suicidal thoughts, seek actual help, I know some people use comedy as a coping method (me), but sometimes it doesn't help as much as it needs to help, for the problem to fade.
Being suicidal is not something that a person should have to deal with for a very long time, or any time at all for that matter, and you should really think about the people who stand close to you who will miss you, the people you might not know would miss you, but surely would if you were gone.

Your life matters, just as much as the next person, so please, don't do anything stupid, and try getting help. I love you, you are important.
