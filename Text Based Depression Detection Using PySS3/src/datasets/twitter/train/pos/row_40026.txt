Drowning in Despair ***Author: Hussain Al-Beshri***

May this ice cold water suffocate me

And freeze my insides to break them apart

Maybe it will break with it my despair

Drowning in it, I couldnâ€™t prepare

For things I thought were unfair

Maybe then I can restart

To never let heat melt my heart

People talk but never understand

The pain going through the veins of a hand

Words become bland

And a man's blood can never stand

May this coldness freeze my corpse

Break it apart and let people remorse
