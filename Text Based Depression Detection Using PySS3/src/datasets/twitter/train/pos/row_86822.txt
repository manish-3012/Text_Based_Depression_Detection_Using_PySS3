Help me find this song iF yOu dArE Okay so my friend wants to find this continent song, and ngl Iâ€™ve been looking for it for like an hour. 

So itâ€™s a continent song to the tune of â€œlove and marriageâ€

And these are the lyrics: 


â€œNorth America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa, donâ€™t forget Antarctica, or way down under in Australia. 

Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian, arctic, the southern ocean.
North Pole, South Pole, equator: I know all about maps and globes.â€
