r/trashy is trashy [TW] idk where else to post this but I got downvoted to absolute shit for saying it was bad to make suicide jokes at a person who attempted to take their own life, having people say I was defending someone who was â€œbegging for attentionâ€. That sub is a fucking 4chan dumpster fire, it lives up to its name lmao
