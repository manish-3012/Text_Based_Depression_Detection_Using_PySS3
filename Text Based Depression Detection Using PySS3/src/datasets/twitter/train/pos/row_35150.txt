WHAT THE FYCJ IS GOING ON Let me explain

About a week ago I met a girl on my university's discord and later in real life after band rehearsal. We talked for a bit and took a pic in the discord and then left.

But then things have gotten weird in the discord. For some reason she changed her roles to him/her in the Discord and denied that she was in the band even though she was a week ago?! Also when people asked what she looked like I brought up the pic and asked me to delete it (which i did).... This all sounds kinda sus...

What the fuck is going on??? Why is this happening??? I'm so confused...........
