Idk just questioning life ignore if you want Sorry this is for myself but itâ€™s gonna be a bunch of questions. 

If parallel universe theory is true would there be a creator in each universe or would it be overseeing all of them or just one. Are humans the optimal species to be  on earth or would we be beaten by an animal if it  wasnâ€™t endangered. If the universe is infinitely expanding when would it collapse, maybe it already has we wouldnâ€™t know because if the shored of light is the fastest it would take a long time to go an unknown distance at the speed of light also black homies are cool ok peace out Iâ€™ll continue this tomorrow
