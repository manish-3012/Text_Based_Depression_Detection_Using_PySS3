And just like that I forgave her... You may have seen [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/iaizvp/what_a_fucking_bitch/) that's currently on the front page. Well, here's an update to it. We talked a little bit, she's stoned as hell. I told her either talk to me and work things out and tell me why the fuck she got so mad over that or I'm blocking her. I honestly thought she'd choose the blocking but much to my surprise she actually talked to me about it. And just like that, even though I was pissed as hell, I forgive her. I shouldn't and I'm not gonna let her live this down but I'm not about to end a friendship that's lasted for years because of dumb shit like that.

Honestly though, I don't think I'm gonna talk to her near as much as I was for a while. Give myself time to cool down. If she does shit like this again, I'm not gonna forgive her a second time.
