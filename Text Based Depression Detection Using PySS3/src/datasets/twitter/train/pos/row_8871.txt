I need advice for hanging out during COVID ***tl:dr- my friend wants to hang out indoors for multiple hours at a time in high risk locations but I don't feel comfortable with that. I feel bad turning her down but still want to hang out. Any safer options? How to bring it up?***

My friend and I have been close friends for 2-3 years. Since COVID has blown up, we haven't been able to see each other or talk that much (about 7ish months). We both miss each other know that we want to hang out, but I'm scared about how she suggested it.

There's a movie coming out and there is only one showing of it close enough to us. This means there will most likely be more people there to watch since it's limited. Given that I dread just going to the store, I don't feel comfortable at all sitting in a theater with strangers for 2+ hours where their masks may not be on the entire time because they are eating. I know the movie theater will most likely distance people but its's not a highly ventilated area.

On top of this, it sounds like she wants to have a sleepover. Her parents are okay with it but my mother is immunocompromised. I can't risk my mother's health or mine to hang out with my friend, as much as I want to have a sleepover with her.

I treasure my friendship with this person to the point where I would put her wants in front of mine. I hate the idea of letting her down because she is so excited to see me and the movie (she's been messaging me about how excited she is all day). I want to hang out with her, but I need alternatives to the movies and a sleepover.

What can I do to make us both happy? How do I break the news to her that I don't feel safe?

Have a nice day/night and thanks for reading :)
