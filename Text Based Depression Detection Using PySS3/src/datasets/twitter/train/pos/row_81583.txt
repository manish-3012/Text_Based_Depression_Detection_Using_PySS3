Ok so tomorrow could either be a really good day or a really bad day. My period is supposed to happen tomorrow but I'm going on a two hour drive to visit my nan for her birthday. Sitting in a car with a pad on for two hours is uncomfortable but I don't use tampons and I can't really get any right now.

So if my period is late it could be a really good day but if my period is on time it could be terrible
