am i a bad person for keeping myself safe? for some backstory my parents are divorced. me, my mom, and sister live in one place and my dad and brother another place.
on christmas my mom had informed me and my sister that my dad and brother were exposed to covid but our dinner plans we made would still happen. i have made it very clear to my whole family that i am very scared of getting sick but my mom decided they were going to come over anyway. 
there was a very real possibility that they could have been sick so i avoided them and stayed in my room. the big deal is that my dad had made a very nice christmas dinner that he wanted everyone to enjoy. i wanted to as well but didnt. now my whole family is making me feel like a terrible person because after they both tested negative. part if me feels like i should have eaten with them and the other part of me wonders what would have happened were they positive. i cant tell who is right and wrong in this situation because i have told this story to some friends and they sided with me but my family disagrees.
