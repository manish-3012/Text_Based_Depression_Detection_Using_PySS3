I think I'm going to run away at 18 and not tell anyone I know it sounds cliche but I hate this fucking town and all towns around it including the people.

The people are horrible, I have yet to find a person that didn't fuck me up in some way.

As soon as I hit 18 I'll be gone, I don't know where but somewhere far away to start my life over.

The past won't exist to me and I'll do my best to do shit right this time.

2 more years and I'll be free, I just have to hold on for a bit
