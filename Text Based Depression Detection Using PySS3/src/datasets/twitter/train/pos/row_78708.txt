I saw this video about how like nobody really wants to adopt teenagers. And it made me think like if I did ever want to adopt I'd rather adopt a teen than a little kid. But then I thought like I'm almost 21 and I'm into dating younger guys that shit would be funny if my son is like 16 and my boyfriend 18
