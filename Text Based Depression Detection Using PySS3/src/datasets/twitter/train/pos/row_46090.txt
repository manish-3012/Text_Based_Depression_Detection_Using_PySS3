Whyd she have to be gay? Like Iâ€™m so happy I met her sheâ€™s so nice and Iâ€™m so happy sheâ€™s my friend but like, idk man. I just want something romantic with someone. Iâ€™m perfectly fine with just being friends with her, sheâ€™s really great, itâ€™s not really about her. I just wish I had options yk? Like idk man. Maybe sheâ€™ll introduce me to someone.
