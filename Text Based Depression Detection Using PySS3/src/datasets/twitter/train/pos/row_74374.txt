Hello fellow Teenagers, how do you feel at School ? Yes i am Old. 25 Years old. I am still young &amp; want to keep myself from the Newest Stands, but im not in on Infantile Stuff like Fortnite or Among us. Donâ€™t worry im not Pedophile, i hope that im welcome here. I also more or less feeling like i am one of you. But thats besides the Point.

I want to share my Conversation with everyone in this Sub, i am studying Technical Chemistry all i am going to tell, Teachers in my School lost the Energy &amp; interest to teach us all. This Semester we started with Online Classes on MS Teams on undefined Time. It is so: Teachers starts with the Lessions &amp; 10 Minutes later they tell us, to look on the Books by yourself or watch those recommended Youtube Videos about this Lession.

Sure i take Notes from every Lession, but sometimes: i feel like i only take Empty Notes &amp; we didnt even wrote any Exams in this 2 Months we got so much lectures to learn, but donâ€™t know where to start. Thats why i feel i write Empty Notes. I am Burning out, because i donâ€™t know, where to start to learn. 2 weeks ago we had Safety on Chemistry &amp; Electrotechnical &amp; a week ago, we had Metals &amp; Pneumatics.

Thats why i make this Post, i want to make a Conversation with some teens here, if they feel the same as me. Your Story somehow will somehow makes my heart &amp; mind a little bit lighter.
