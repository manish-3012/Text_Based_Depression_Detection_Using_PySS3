If you want to represent Southern pride, there are a lot of better things than the confederate flag. * Southern music, Louis Armstrong and a bunch of other people made some of the most influential music of all time in the south
* Southern scenery, the south is one of the most beautiful places I've even been
* Southern civil rights activists, the south produced a ton of civil rights advocates who were very good people

you representing southern pride through the confederacy is just you revering racists.
