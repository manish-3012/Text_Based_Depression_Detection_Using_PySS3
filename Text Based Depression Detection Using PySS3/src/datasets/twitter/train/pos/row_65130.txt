tw//Reconciled with friends, same red flags and I don't know what to do They're saying the n word, the r word, claiming to be pedophiles and making fun of genders and pronouns. I didn't remember it to be so toxic, and I don't know what to do. I missed them but they're offensive and if I were to tell them they're wrong they'd make fun of me.

I thought one of them was my soulmate or smth, and that's the main reason I came back. Any advice on how to detach?
