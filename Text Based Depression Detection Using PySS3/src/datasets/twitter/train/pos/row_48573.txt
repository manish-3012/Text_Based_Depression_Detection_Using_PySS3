Teenagers of this sub, help me prove my cousin wrong! So, I don't bother with instagram a lot, I have about 23 followers.

However, my cousin thinks that even if I did try to gain more followers, I would not be able to reach 100.

After that assumption, a bet was placed. I would have to gain 100 followers in a week.

So, help me reddit, help me prove my cousin wrong and make me reach 100 followers.
