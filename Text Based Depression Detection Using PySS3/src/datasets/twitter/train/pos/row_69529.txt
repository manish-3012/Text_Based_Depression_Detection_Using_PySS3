I wrote another rap /slow song 

Lately I feel like Iâ€™m stuck
Lately I feel like I am trapped
Thatâ€™s nothing new,I say it in every song
The new thing is 
 Iâ€™m comfortable here
But yet filled with pain
I know if I like it in here 
I shouldnâ€™t complain
But honestly 
I like it because I know everything in here
Anything that happens is written on a book
Specified as a rule , so when something bad happens 
I always know how to fix if ,
But all of sudden , I realized that 
If I stay here all my life I ainâ€™t going nowhere else
I canâ€™t just sit here waiting for a miracle to happen
If I ainâ€™t moving things ainâ€™t moving neither 
If I want to find love then Iâ€™ve got to make a move 
I used to chase something I didnâ€™t know what it was 
It felt  strange 
But now I  know that I was looking for a change

This road is a dead end
Canâ€™t continue through this path
Canâ€™t always stay contained 
All I need I just change
This road is a dead end 
Can continue through this path
Canâ€™t always stay contained
All I need is change

Iâ€™m searching for change
But that brings a new question
What is change?
what am I pursuing 
Then I realized,that nothing is different
I used to be trapped in a cage of fear 
Looking for change,
Now I am trapped between questions 
And I am searching for the awnsers  to those
But fear and questions,arenâ€™t they the same
Arenâ€™t they two names for the same face
I knew all this long time ago 
I just didnâ€™t wanna admit it 

This road is a dead end
Canâ€™t continue through this path
Canâ€™t always stay contained 
All I need I just change
This road is a dead end 
Can continue through this path
Canâ€™t always stay contained
All I need is change


Letâ€™s be honest I canâ€™t lie to myself
I knew what I was searching for 
All this time along
But I was too scared to commit 
Who am I kidding ,I still am 
I wanted to be free, 
But I am held against the wall
A path is a cage
But having no path to follow is just the same 
Then where am I going,
I am always gonna lie to myself
Saying I donâ€™t do enough
Or wake up , and finally reach this train
That I have been chasing
