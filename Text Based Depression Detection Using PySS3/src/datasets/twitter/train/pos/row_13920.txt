Daily song recommendations for reddit: day 8 Another day has come, so another song awaits. This time, we have something from a south african band. It's seether, and from their album "si vis pacem, para bellum", which is a great latin saying. Either way, it's the last songs of the album: Written in stone. It's just a basic song, but it is well played. I love it, expecially with the vocals, in which, i think he carries the whole song to be one of the best on the album.

There is in reality not a whole lot to this song. Like, at all. But i almost think that helps. It's so simple, yet it works. Sorry, can't say a lot about it, which means this is so short. Tomorrow, the song will be about not having enough money to do something nice.
