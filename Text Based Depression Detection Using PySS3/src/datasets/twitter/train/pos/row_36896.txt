How much should I study? Iâ€™m trying to pass some school admissions exams, I donâ€™t know how much studying per day is good to bump my knowledge in math to geometry.

Probably not the best to ask for advice on studying since itâ€™s quite different for everyone, but I thought I might need an adjustable start.
