My little sister attempted to hang herself. Today has been one of the hardest days of my life. I just found out that my sister tried to commit suicide. I'm in a dark place, and all I want is for her to feel loved and supported. She's super bright, and has a great life ahead of her. How do I cope with this, and how do show her I care?
