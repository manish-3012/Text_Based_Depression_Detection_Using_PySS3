My mom is very different from other moms and I HATE THAT Usually moms around the world won't buy expensive things to their children won't defend them if they did something wrong etc but my mom is completely different

My mom always buy expensive shit for me even though I didn't want it. I remember that she bought me 6-7 expensive pens when I was in 6th grade even if I didn't ask. She's ready to defend me even if I did something wrong which leaves me feeling even more guilty. The only time she used to scold me is if I didn't score good marks or if I didn't study. Recently she bought me an expensive smartphone even though I asked for one which was half the price. I hope she stop buying me this kind of expensive shit and hope she stops defending me. When she does this it makes me feels very guilty for some fucking reason
