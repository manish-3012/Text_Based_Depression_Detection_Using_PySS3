How to advise two young men on what to expect and how to handle high school I am the father of two young boys and I would like to be able to tell them some good advice on how to prepare for life in school and what the major pitfalls are.

When I was in high school, it was sometimes difficult because there were folks that would readily beat you up just if you looked at them the wrong way.

I dealt with bullying, peer pressure (drugs and alcohol) and confusion in how to interact with the opposite sex.

What might be your best advice to give to two young boys getting ready to interact with others in high school, in this age of social media and environmental responsibility and everything else that I have no clue about?

Thank you for your time.
