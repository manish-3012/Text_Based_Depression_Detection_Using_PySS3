Iâ€™m somewhat surprised that theyâ€™re even tracking Santa this year. Heâ€™s currently breaking travel restrictions.

But seriously can you imagine if NORAD wasnâ€™t tracking Santa because of coronavirus? Unfortunately I can, but thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve become a cynical asshole over the last nine and a half months.
