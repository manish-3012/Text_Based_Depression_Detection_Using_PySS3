I was taking an online exam and... I was taking an online exam, it was an unimportant one yet we still had to have our cams and mics open to prevent cheating. Now that you know the exam conditions hereâ€™s a little something about me, sometimes I can just randomly start singing when Iâ€™m at my desk at home doing work. You can probably see where this is going. I randomly started humming/singing again and then about a minute in I realized my mic was on. The teacher was just quiet. Worst part: because nobody reacted I donâ€™t know if the mic picked it up.

Kill me
