Life is gonna suck hella bad for the next few weeks I crashed my car in the ice on the way to work at 5 am the other day, itâ€™s gonna cost a fair bit to fix it and in the mean time I have no car 

Meaning Iâ€™m going to be having to ride my bike to work. And Iâ€™m going to be riding my bmx as itâ€™s my cheapest bike as I donâ€™t trust leaving my expensive ones at work. 

A bmx, down country lanes, covered in ice, at 5 am pitch black -5 degree temperatures is gonna be absolutely hell 

But I guess I just gotta muscle through 

Worst bit is I only crashed my car because I have to start work at 6 when itâ€™s so icy
