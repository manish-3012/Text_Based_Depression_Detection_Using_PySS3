My laptop canty get any worse So it froze for a few minutes, after trying to turn it off and on something went wrong and my only choice was to reset it (note that I chose an option to keep all my stuff), after a few hours of waiting to reinstall windows, it had to update everything, while updating it deleted all my stuff including games, pics etc. and now I have nothing left on it and all my osu! scores went to shadow realm, so can we gen an F for it
