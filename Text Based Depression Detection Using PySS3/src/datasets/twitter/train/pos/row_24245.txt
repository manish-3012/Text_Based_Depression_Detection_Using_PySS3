Mixed learning is zggshjdnfjckvcmfmfkf Due to my limited understanding of the english lexicon, zggshjdnfjckvcmfmfkf is how i can best express my emotions.

In seriousness, my school just started allowing students back in to school (an unwise decision imo) and my parents made me stay home. I know itâ€™s for the best, but a part of me is still a wee.

Cue a day of seeing everyone meet everyone after an extended time of separation, and here i and aproxx 50 out of 300-something 7th graders sitting at our computers alone.

Now, everyone has felt a sense of an exclusion before in life, especially in middle school. I wasnâ€™t happy about it, but what can you do? The real kicker was me missing 7th period due to my teacher literally not opening the meeting. I feel like me staying home has made me less, important(?) Iâ€™m not sure.

I think iâ€™m sounding kind of bitchy, but i had to get this off of my chest.
