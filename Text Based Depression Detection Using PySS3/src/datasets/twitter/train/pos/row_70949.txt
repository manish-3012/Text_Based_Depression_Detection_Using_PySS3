This is a gentle rant on sexism. Dear Reddit, I have gotten wind that boys are cheating on girls and breaking their hearts, making girls delete their accounts and have emotional breakdowns. Because Will Smith was cheated on. This would not be fair if genders were swapped or not. This is not okay. Nobody deserves that. Getting attached to somebody like that and then having them PURPOSELY kick you in the stomach like that is horrible. It hurts.
