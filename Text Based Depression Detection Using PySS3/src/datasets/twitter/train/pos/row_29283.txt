I fucking hate being the basically only extrovert in my friend group. So when I first started secondary school I definitely wasnt a extrovert in my friend group I was quiet and shy, then I began getting more comfortable with my surroundings and I began to stand up for me and my friends becuase well we arent very popular. I'm some what ok, they dont mess with me. Whether that's becuase they dont mind me or I dont show weakness I dont know. But I find myself in situations where they cant stand up for themselves and i have to speak out. Between the end of 1st year and middle of second year I wouldnt have minded. I didnt give a fuck about what people thought of me so I didnt have anything 2 lose from speaking out. But now, I'm so fucking insecure and depressed I'll try and stay out of it. Of course I'll still help them when they need it becuase if I dont say anything shit might get worse for them and I dont want that 2 happen but u fucking hate doing it. And they dont even fucking make it easier for me. We're all nerds and they're all so fucking naive to make themselves seem tough or act "cool" in their opinion. I'm like the only one who could actually pull off being somewhat cool not 2 be full if myself it's just cus they've put 2 much of a target on their back.

I fuckung hate being seen as the on extrovert in my group having to deal with my introverted friends problems.
