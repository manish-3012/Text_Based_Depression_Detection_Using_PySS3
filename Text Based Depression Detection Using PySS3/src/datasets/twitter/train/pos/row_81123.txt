Something my Grandpa Told me Today For Context: He was giving me a haircut at his shop, but I wear glasses and he has me take them off before he starts.

G: So what do you think so far?

Me: I guess it looks good, but I can't really see it.

G: Well then, *Razor Starts Buzzing*, that works to my advantage.

Idk thought it was a good one-liner.
