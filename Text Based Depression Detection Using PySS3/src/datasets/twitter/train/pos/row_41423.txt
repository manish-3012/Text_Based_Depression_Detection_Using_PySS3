A girl told me something that somehow instantly made me feel better about myself I'm usually pretty insecure about being a virgin at 17. I don't think I'll lose it ever. I was talking to this one girl and I said it sucks knowing I'll never be anybodies first time. It simply won't be as special. But she told me "you can still be someone's first good boyfriend, the first one that actually cares. You would actually make a good boyfriend". And that instantly made me feel better about myself. Whenever I feel worried about it I just think back to that.
