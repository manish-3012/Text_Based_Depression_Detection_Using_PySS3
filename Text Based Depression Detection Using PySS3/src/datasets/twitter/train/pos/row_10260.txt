The things people do for clout are crazy So many people have been dissed, bullied, and disregarded because some kid wanted to look cool. It hasn't really happened to me that badly in a year, but I still get major insecurities from the literal years of bullying and betrayal I had to endure. Look, mate, you're on top of the world.. but for what? The life of another? This shit is serious, mate. Kids like that sit at the bottom, confused as to how to socialize. They always ask whether or not they're doing it right. Others answer with even more 'roasts' and shit. Like, dude.. Really? It's cold. Anyone who has to endure this now: please know, you ARE worth it. I don't give a flying fuck about what those people say. They're mad because you don't conform to their outlandish standards.. and that's on them, not you. Please, stay safe. I know these times are tough.. I wish you the best.
