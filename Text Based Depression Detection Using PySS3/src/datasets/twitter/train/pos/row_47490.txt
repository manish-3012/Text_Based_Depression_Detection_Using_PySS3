I got waitlisted Well obviously if you seen my flair you know it wasnâ€™t for college... well kinda but not really, but basically where I live you can go to this Early college instead of like the one in your district and I wanted to go cause 1)most of my friends applied (and got in) and 2)I recently moved and Iâ€™m not sure if you noticed but its really hard to meet people in COVID. and honestly if I had gone to the school I went to year ago I would have been fine but I donâ€™t so. Maybe Iâ€™m whining over nothing but it does suck I almost wish I just got rejected cause then Iâ€™d at least know... \*sigh\* I canâ€™t wait till I have to go through this again in 4 (or 5 if I get in) years
