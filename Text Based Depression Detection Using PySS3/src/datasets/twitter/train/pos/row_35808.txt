I fee like my mom doesnâ€™t care about me I feel like my mom only does what she has to for me bc sheâ€™s my mom and no other reason. I feel like she only cares about her boyfriend. Sheâ€™s gone on countless vacations with her bf but only 1 with me, thereâ€™s always some new excuse as to why she went on one with him and not me. Iâ€™m afraid to say anything to my dad about it because heâ€™ll say something to my mom and itâ€™ll break her heart and if I told my grandma sheâ€™d kill my mom. I still love my mom with all my heart and the idea that she doesnâ€™t give a shit is so painful. She always promises me things and never follows through. And when I bring them up she always tells me to be grateful and stop asking for things when they werenâ€™t even my idea in the first place. My bike is really old and beat up and I had bought one off my friend. She told me at the start of June that she was gonna buy me a new one. I brought up the idea yesterday and she nearly had a stroke just at the idea that I would even dare to ask about getting a new bike even though she had promised it. Any advice on how to handle things? It hurts me so much and I just want it to get better
