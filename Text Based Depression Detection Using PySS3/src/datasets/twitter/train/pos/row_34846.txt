If a girl purposely ignores you and is very clearly not interested in you, should you still confess your feelings to them? I made a previous post telling everyone that itâ€™s not worth confessing but Iâ€™m wondering what you guys really think, if someone doesnâ€™t like you but you like them, should you still tell them you like them, knowing theyâ€™re going to say theyâ€™re not interested? This doesnâ€™t really make any sense to me.
