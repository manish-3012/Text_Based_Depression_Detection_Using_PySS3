Quarantine fucked me up (Thoughts) (Don't criticise i'm screaming and leaving digital traces of existing.)

Hi, I'm writing this cuz I just realised the changes that happened to me because of isolation and all that...

Let me start with the fact that I'm not a social butterfly. I don't really have friends, so I didn't think this isolation would alter that much on my life...

My mind doesn't work as it used to, I keep zoning out. No matter what I do, I can't wake up at all... Uhm...

&amp;#x200B;

I go to sleep at 2AM - I wake up around 5PM

I go to sleep at 6AM -  I wake up around 1PM

&amp;#x200B;

even tho I sometimes sleep 14 hours, other times 8, sometimes 4... I feel tired every single moment that I'm awake... I can't get back on my normal sleeping cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

tbh i dont even know how to continue this post, i can't think straight

I'm very stressed out, I'm living in fear. Something really fucked me up.

\+ it doesn't help that I'm locked up 24/7 with my grandparents in this place... alone... my cousin was here too, but she moved to Germany... so im just alone, my grandparents keep annoying me... when i tell them to stop or something, after five minutes i feel bad for them cuz they didnt mean to annoy me or whatever

fuck im tired...

i'd add that i just wanted a normal life, living with my mom... but thats all lost cuz now im 18 and a year from now im going to be at university... i wish i was already there.. I wish it was 2002 and I'd be at Uni... what the hell am I even writing about at this point...
