My friend gave me her blade Hey all, so my friend finally gave me her pencil sharpener razor. It's definitely a step forward. I don't know where I'm supposed to go from here. I think this is her only blade but I'm not sure. Her blade was rusted and her mom is anti-vaxx and I'm not sure what to do. She hadn't harmed herself since Tuesday so that's good also. Ugh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck does anybody have advice
