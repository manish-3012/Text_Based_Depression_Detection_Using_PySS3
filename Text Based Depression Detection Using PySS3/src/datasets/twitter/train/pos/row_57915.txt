I'm confused Me and this girl have been talking. We became Valentine's. So we've both been taking about hugging and cuddling when we see each next. We couldn't hang out today due to her parents fighting. She then was talking about kissing. So I asked if she'd be my girlfriend. She said she's not ready. I'm wondering if I did something. But maybe she just isn't ready
