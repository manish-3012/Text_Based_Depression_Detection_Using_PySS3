Proof school is bullshit So, they're teaching us about heroes (because we don't already know what that means apparently) and they ask us to prepare a speech in the voice of a real hero. The example they give: Chadwick Boseman. Did you're mother never teach you that imitating a black man never ends well? How is this teaching us jack shit?

Honestly watching TV would be a better use of my time. I can analyze unique and dynamic characters but instead, they make us barely pick apart a six-thousand-year-old Jungian archetype and imitate a dead black man.
