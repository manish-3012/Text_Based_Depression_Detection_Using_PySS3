Yay hormones I started crying today at lunch because I thought my friend was going to say something mean to me (as a joke obviously) and typically I would be ok with it but I'm really insecure today, so I didn't want her to say anything mean. She didn't even say anything remotely mean she just made an inappropriate joke, but I was so scared that it would be something that would make me cry that just the thought of it made me start bawling 

Anyways thanks for coming to my TED talk
