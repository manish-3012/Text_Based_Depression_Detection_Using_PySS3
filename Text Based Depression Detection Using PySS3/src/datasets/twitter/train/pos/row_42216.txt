is it normal to feel like your skin isnt yours? ive always felt like this, for context im a 15 female/non binary. i get panic attacks at the pure trought of being shirtless and i feel like my own skin doesnt fit me. like im wearing a suit thats a little to big and wasnt made for me
at the moment im using they/them pronouns, but the feeling hasnt really gone away 
is this normal? am i a trans guy in denial ? is it body dysmorphia????
plz help.
