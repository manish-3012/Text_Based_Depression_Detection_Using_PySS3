i literally canâ€™t even talk to my friends anymore because theyâ€™re so unbelievably obsessed with playing Among Us donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s a fun game, but people are doing 4+ hour calls to play it *every single day* which makes it basically impossible to even communicate with anyone. 

last night i was studying for something and i was asking people questions about it, and iâ€™d also been trying to work out plans to hang out with someone this weekend, and none of them responded to me at all because they were too busy playing among us until 1 in the morning.

yesterday at school, we had a little bit of time after lunch before our next period, and a group of people literally said â€œwe have 12 minutes left before we have to be in class, letâ€™s all go to this hangout spot on the other side of campus to play among us.â€ like... yeah no, iâ€™m not obsessed enough with the game to walk half a mile so i can play for 2 minutes and then go to class. but if thatâ€™s really their idea of fun then oh well

iâ€™m also upset because we used to do group video calls just to hang out and talk to each other, and now almost nobody even joins them anymore and the very few people who do just turn their cameras off and play among us with another group of people the entire time.

seriously, i get that itâ€™s a fun game, but iâ€™m not gonna have any friends left by the time this game goes out of popularity because itâ€™s the only thing people want to do every waking moment
