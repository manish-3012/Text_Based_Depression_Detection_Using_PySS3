Dear Santa Dear Santa,

All I want for Christmas is a girlfriend...

I have been a good boy for my life, got into good uni this year with a scholarship, worked out for muscles, didn't give up my Korean citizenship, grew my hair so I can look like kpop star,  and volunteered more than 1000hours. 

Please let me end my last Christmas as a high school student with a girlfriend.

Sincerely

P.S I bought some Costco cookies for you...
