Thoughts on this game idea? Basically, itâ€™s a 2d RPG, but the battle system resembles guitar hero. In which you have to hit targets of different colors as they land. Missing a target causes you to lose health, while hitting them does damage to the enemy. You have to avoid certain targets that also do damage to you, and youâ€™d also have to keep track of your weapon, as it breaks over time. Thoughts?
