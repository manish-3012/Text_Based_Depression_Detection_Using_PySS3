Wanna hear a joke? A piece of string walked into a bar and got very drunk.

He causes a ruckus and ends up getting kicked out.

So then he messes up his hair and ties it up at the end.

He then walked back in and, when he does, the bartender asked "didn't I just kick you out?"

To which the string replied "no, I'm a frayed knot"
