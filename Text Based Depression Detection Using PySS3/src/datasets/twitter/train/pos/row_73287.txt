Ack, I need some suggestions for a paper about some sorta political thing What political topic would too be too bad for a very conservative southern public school? Iâ€™m a leftist and I donâ€™t agree with just about anything my classmates think. Also abortion is already off the board since the teacher said itâ€™s too controversial. Like what is good enough to express my opinion but not bad enough to where the teacher gives me weird looks for the rest of the year.
