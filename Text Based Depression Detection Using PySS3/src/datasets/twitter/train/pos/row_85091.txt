a brief description of an interaction i had yesterday me: i got into one of my colleges!
coworker: oh congrats! what major are you studying?
me: business!
coworker: oh, so you picked the easy route! thatâ€™s cool!
me: bruh 

anyways if ur one of those people that shame business majors, pls donâ€™t because itâ€™s actually hard and iâ€™m doing it because iâ€™m interested in it. not to mention business majors have great starting salaries.
