Mermaid man has PTSD When we're first introduced to mermaid man and barnacle boy, mermaid man freaks out whenever he hears "there's evil afoot". Mermaid man's freak out consisted of him running to hide and screaming about a death ray. SpongeBob dose talk about a shrink ray later on in the episode, but not a death ray. 
In addition in the episode where Barnacle boy turns evil, (the Barnacle man episode) it is revealed that mermaid man used to  be in a super hero team called I. J. L. S. A ; we rarely hear anything about the team after that episode and their suits seem to be in near mint condition. My theroy is that all of the other I. J. L. S. A members died in via death ray while mermaid man was hiding.
