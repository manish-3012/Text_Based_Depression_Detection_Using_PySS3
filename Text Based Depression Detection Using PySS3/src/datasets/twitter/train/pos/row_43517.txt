"Because I paid for it" is not a fucking good answer Nice to know I won't be getting dinner tonight because my drunk parents decided it would be funny if they just didn't order dinner for me and my brothers, but just enough for themselves.

I ask them why they're not getting enough for everyone and I get a swift "well I paid for it."

They then proceed to tell me to finish off the cold fried rice in the fridge from 4 days ago :)
