Okay i may have chronologically confuse you with this. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/iweio9/this_is_a_rant_a_long_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

In that post, L leaves for good when i was 11, or around there, but i think i said i was 13. That was a lie. But, after somebodies help(thanks reddit!) I was able to track down her dad and i shot him a message, so that means i have a chance at seeing L again! I'm honestly as happy as i think i can be right now. How are you guys?
