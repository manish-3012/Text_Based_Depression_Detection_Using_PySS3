What is even the point of politics in the us You know how they say the best 1 party system is a 2 party system with the illusion of choice?

Well letâ€™s look at the 2 candidates 

Both are racist, both are authoritarian and economically right, both have rape allegations, both could very likely die while in office due to advanced age, both are homophobic and have choices in vpâ€™s even worse then themselves, Biden is a corporate puppet, while trump can barely think rationally when he tries

At this point the only difference is that Trump is a little more extreme in these 

But why are we picking the barely better one of the lesser of 2 evils?
