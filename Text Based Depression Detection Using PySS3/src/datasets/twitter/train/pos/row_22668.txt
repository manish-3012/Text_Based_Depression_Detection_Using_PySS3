I will die on the hill that Insomniac is better than American Idiot. Like American Idiot is a way better album most of the time because it has songs like Homecoming, Jesus of Suburbia, and Whatsername all being in my top 5 Green Day songs but it also has some filler like She's A Rebel and Give Me Novacaine. Insomniac on the other hand is just great song after great song. One of the only issues is that everything sounds the same a lot of the time.
