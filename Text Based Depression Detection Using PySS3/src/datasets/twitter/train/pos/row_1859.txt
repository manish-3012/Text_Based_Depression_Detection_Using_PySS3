Hey I just need some help real quick, any input would be great So me an oblivious dumbass, went 4 months not realizing a girl had liked me, well she told be after the school year ended 2 years ago, funny thing was the entire time I liked her too, well then we ended up having this weird fling thing, things got more serious and she kinda just ended it, saying she just wants to be friends, issue is I never stopped liking her, a year after all this we both end up getting into separate relationships, and well they both end up ending around the same time funny enough (I just want to say the reason I broke up with said girl was not because of original girl) well pretty much the entire time weâ€™ve off and on talked, and she came into where I work today and messaged me, we talked for hours..issue is I still like her, and well my oblivious ass combined with over analyzing has got my head spinning and it has for basically this entire scenario, I have no clue what to do, I donâ€™t think I should mention anything, but due to over analyzing I may be reading into some things she said way to much, mostly just like â€œI have my reasons but I wonâ€™t tell youâ€ this is when she was saying Iâ€™m not an asshole, donâ€™t remember specifics but I think I said I can be a slight assailed from time to time like every other human, then near the end something that happened during my big oblivious time was brought up but she kept on saying stuff like â€œIâ€™m going to go to sleep so I keep my mouth shut/stop talkingâ€ and itâ€™s got me real confused 

But yeah my main question is just..what should I do? I really have no clue and I have insomnia and Iâ€™m sick now so I already canâ€™t sleep, but this whole thing just has my head spinning going over situation over situation, thinking Iâ€™m just some oblivious dumbass..but Iâ€™m probably just reading into it too much

To anyone who helps and is readying this far thank you so much

Tl;dr-Iâ€™m known to be oblivious, but Iâ€™m also analytical and tend to over analyze, Iâ€™ve liked this girl for years now and I donâ€™t know what to do due to past occurrences
