Iâ€™m finally coming out! After 3 years of hiding it Iâ€™ll be coming out to my parents as transgender and I hope it goes well, but in case it goes south Iâ€™m going to have my friend on speed dial and Iâ€™ve already packed money and clothes for the worst. Hoping things go well come tomorrow morning, Iâ€™ve really just gotten inspired to come out due to the bravery of others inspiring me to do the same, wish me luck.
