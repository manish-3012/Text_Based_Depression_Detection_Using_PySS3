Question for the oldies So Iâ€™m 19 and I have a question for other 17-19 year olds. Do people constantly expect you to suddenly act like youâ€™re a 40 year old? Whenever I do something that isnâ€™t the smartest, my parents say, â€œyou say youâ€™re an adult and you can do what you want, but then you do this.â€ 

I have never said that Iâ€™m an adult now that Iâ€™m over 18 and therefore I can do what I want. But also, the prefrontal cortex doesnâ€™t stop developing until mid to late 20s scientifically people are still stupid in their 20s. 

I just feel like there are really weird and unrealistic expectations for us older teens.
