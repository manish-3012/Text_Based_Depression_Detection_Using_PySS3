Please Help I'm in band and there's this girl I really like who is also in band. I've had a few conversations with her about band but I want to have a normal conversation with her without being so obvious that I like her, but social anxiety and everything I don't know how to start a conversation because everytime I want to I start to panic and never ending up starting a conversation. How do I find a way to talk to her without basically screaming "I like you"
