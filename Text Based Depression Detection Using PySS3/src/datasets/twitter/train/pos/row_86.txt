Am I in the wrong? I have to share a room with my older brother. He always kicks me out of my own room so then I have to spend every moment with my sister who is 4 years younger then me. I have to constantly be with her, and do whatever she wants, I even have to sleep on the floor in her room. My brother was gone tonight so I just wanted to spend the night by myself playing video games. So I tell my sister Iâ€™ll sit with you until you fall asleep. She starts saying I want to sleep in your room and I say no. Then my mom starts screaming at me that Iâ€™m terrible for making her feel bad. Am I in the wrong?
