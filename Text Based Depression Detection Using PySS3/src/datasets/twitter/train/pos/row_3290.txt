Iâ€™m extremely jealous of people that say theyâ€™ve become better people with all this time alone because of the coronavirus Itâ€™s like time literally doesnâ€™t have an effect on who I am. Iâ€™m literally the exact same and I canâ€™t say this has done anything positive for my mental health at all. If anything itâ€™s been worse. Itâ€™s like yay Iâ€™m happy that everyoneâ€™s a â€œcompletely different person nowâ€ but yeah I just canâ€™t relate. Every time I talk to people theyâ€™re all like â€œIâ€™ve picked up so many hobbies and Iâ€™ve truly become better.â€ I kinda just go along with it bc I donâ€™t wanna be a buzzkill but Iâ€™ve given up anything I tried and I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so stuck and all I can do is constantly tell myself I need to do something and getting out of bed feels like a punishment. All I feel is guilt at pretty much all times
