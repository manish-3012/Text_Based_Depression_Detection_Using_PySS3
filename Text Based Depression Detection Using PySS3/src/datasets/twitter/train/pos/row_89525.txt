I just beat Watch_Dogs 2. I'm not happy. I don't know what to feel. It's not like "WOHOO I DID IT IM SO GOOD AT THE GAME YAYYY". It's like I lost a friend. I just don't have anything to do with the game anymore. Even if I start a new save, I can't discover things anymore. I can wait until Legion launches, and I can play the first one, but this game just holds a special place in my heart. I know I'm overly dramatic, and maybe I'll just laugh it off while playing some Isaac. But until then, I'll be sad.
