My Week This week has been fucking terrible for me, and mentally damaging.

Monday - Parents yell at me for being disorganized and not writing down assignments despite me always finishing them. I cried.

Tuesday + Wednesday - The only chill days this week.

Thursday - Parents yell at me again for not filling out my planner. Mom says something nasty then forgets about it.

Today - Turned in an English assignment a few hours late and dad yells at me. Then when showing him pictures for my biology assignment he tries grabbing my phone to scroll through my camera roll and after turning it off, he told me he felt betrayed. Cried again.
