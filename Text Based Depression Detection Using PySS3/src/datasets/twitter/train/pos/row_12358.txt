Can someone give me an actual laugh? I'm feeling like shit. I have concentration problems, and my parents refuse to do jack about it exept say "you're just purposely doing that"  "why don't you grow up?" and my grades have been suffering. part of their ignorance is that they grew up in the place/era of if you had concentration problems, you would get beat and told to grow up. so now my grades have been suffering, and i asked before for help to concentrate, and some of you brain dead dumbasses just decide to state the obvious. now i just want something to cheer me up because i literally cant go to sleep without crying. please.
