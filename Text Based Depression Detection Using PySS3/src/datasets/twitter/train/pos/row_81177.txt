To any of you that lost a loved pet, what did your parents do to help make the loss easier? Old man here, sorry if this isnâ€™t the place for this question but Iâ€™d rather hear it straight from teenagers than anyone else. My daughter is 14 and we lost our dog of over 10 years a few days ago. It would feel very wrong to surprise her with a new dog on Christmas so Iâ€™m trying to think of anything else I can do. Thanks in advance- I hope you all enjoy your holiday break.
