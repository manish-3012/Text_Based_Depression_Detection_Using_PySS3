Still don't know to do it I already posted something like this two days ago, but I still don't have balls to do it, I'm too coward. I fell in love with my best friend almost a year ago, and I want to tell him what I feel, but I'm too scared of loosing him because he's probably not gay/bi. I already asked his friends if he's gay or something similar they told me they don't know. I really want to have something with him, as he attracts me a lot. I sometimes try to flirt with him, and I think he thinks it's some kind of joke, he also flirts with me, but I think that is also some kind of joke so, can anyone give me advice?
