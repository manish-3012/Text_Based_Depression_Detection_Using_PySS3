okay guys real quick: iâ€™ve been a rlly shitty friend and taking hours to reply and being distant to my friend. i feel rlly bad abt it but at the same time idk why i do. wtf am i supposed to say? like we used to be so so so so close but now iâ€™m kinda the reason weâ€™re drifting. ig we donâ€™t share much of our interests anymore. i barely even have interests anymore ngl. 

but anyways, if you were my friend in this situation, would you want an explanation why or just a simple apology and the promise that youâ€™ll do better? would you want something else?
