This boy told me he loved me like 10 times and now Iâ€™m a villain So this boy who loved me was a really nice guy right? But he was like constantly telling me he loved me. Also he was a bit touchy feely, forcing me into his lap even after I had stood up and walked to another chair several times and made it clear I wasnâ€™t comfortable. So when he told me he loved me I just sort of took it light and breezy as I didnâ€™t want to hurt his feelings. Weâ€™re still friends. The other day on this group chat with my close friends he said things like I told her I loved her and she just brushed it off and ignored me. The response was that I was terrible with relationships and that I shouldnâ€™t have done that. I think I handled the situation perfectly well considering we are still good friends. Maybe heâ€™s just a bit bitter. Also, recently heâ€™s been berating me and just overall insulting me and humiliating me in front of my friends. Calling me stupid, obsessed with proving me wrong. I know I work harder than him and I study every day yet he always brags about how much smarter he is than me. He used to be so kind to me. Boys of reddit, is it normal to do this to a girl after you liked her?
