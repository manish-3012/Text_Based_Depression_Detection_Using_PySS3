I want to change the educational system in my country, but i dont know how to make my voice to be heard. "be the change you want to see in the world". You gotta do the work, and i just stepped on the path of trying to make things better in my country. I am from Romania, and the educational system just sucks. First, a lot of Romanians are illiterate, and I am feeling like, with the online school, the number of them will increase. I hate to see my country falling apart, because us, the young men, are the future.
The people who are in charge are just so ignorant. They don't care about what we want or what we think, and i am feeling like we are living in 1900.
So i decided that i want to change it and become louder, even if the ministry is a little deaf. Starting a mini revolution. But i don't know where to start, or what to do. I am also 17yo.

Any suggestions?
