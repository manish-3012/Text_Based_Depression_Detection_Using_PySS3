A lot of stuff to handle at once for me 
Sorry if this is long but I hope you enjoy it 


So I met this girl during the COVID-19 pandemic but sheâ€™s from the same school as I am so we just knew each other looks and we are in the same school so I slide into her dms as a friend trying to make more friends but I really had a big crush on her so we talk and talk maybe we have been talking for couple of months now so couple of days ago I was playing with my friends then she sent me a message and said letâ€™s go on a date I was really shocked and didnâ€™t know what to do so I sent her ??? To buy time to think what to do so I told her okay letâ€™s go on a date and this is my first time going on a date so I asked my older friends they gave me tips and stuff and just told me to be me act as myself and not someone else so couple days later we go on a date it was weird walking around with a girl not the boys anyways we go and eat sushi I never had sushi before so we sit talk just like a normal date and then after that we start walking around   she was really brave doing all of that
so I thought to myself I gotta be brave at least once and told her I have a really big crush on her and I really like her Then we stopped walking and my heart just dropped and she said I really like you too and kissed me also that was my first kiss and now we are in a relationship 



Tldr never had a girlfriend and Iâ€™m not brave got asked on a date had my first kiss and have a girlfriend
