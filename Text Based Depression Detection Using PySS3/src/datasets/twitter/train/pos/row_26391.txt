Finally got back into the habit of exersising So back in March I was doing around 80-100 pushups and around a hundred squats a day. I kind of quit for two months, but I could feel the difference really hard. I really couldn't take it anymore, so I stopped being lazy and got back into exersising. I can't really do 100 pushups a day anymore, but at least it's something.
