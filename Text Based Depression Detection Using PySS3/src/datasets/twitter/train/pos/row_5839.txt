What should I Do? Is she avoiding me or she is just overcoming her old relationship

Hi. I been in love with a girl since 2016. Due to some reasons being me staying in another relation for 3 years, she studying with guys 1 year younger than our age, different campus, etc. We werenâ€™t able to concrete anything. However, when we met we connected and was really nice. 

Now, last week I found out that she broke with her couple and decided to quit, she told me that, I have been trying to talk to her like back in July but she only answers one message after a day. Iâ€™m not trying to start dating her because she spent 7 months with him but, she is a lot of times online and well is like just a simple message. 

Long story short, I have been single for a year, she was dating a guy but they never became a formal couple, she is leaving her 1 year job and her recent couple was working with her. 
During summer they was some teasing that we liked each other when we met but because I kinda acted stupid and so did she well we never said anything until this year, she however was like no but rn Iâ€™m in a â€œrelationâ€. After 2 months well, the relation never turned out. 


Do I give her 1 or 2 months of break? Or is she even interested in me? Idk what to do
