I need help guys, I cant cum when having sex. I know for many this would be a good thing but for me it's not, I have trouble stimulating my dick while having sex, I feel more when masturbating, and this causes me not to be able to come while having sex, I always have to pull out and jerk off to cum and my gf is tired of that and so am I.

Any tips? :(
