I don't know what to do So pretty much, my family has a cat. He ran away almost two months ago, and since then we've pretty much given up hope on finding him. Then today, my mom got a message on facebook with a picture of our cat. They said he showed up and started meowing. My mom got on the phone with them, and said the meow sounded like our cat. When my mom told everyone, my dad said that we shouldn't bother checking if it's him. He said that the cat obviously didn't want to be at our home. 

This caused a huge argument between my mom and dad. He was angry that none of us kids were on his side, which I don't really understand. Anyways, I'll update as soon as I know what happens :)
