I hate it My life is going down to shit and at this point fuck it 

-my grades are low because of this online shit we started September 15 and I just figured out almost everything 

-my social skills are trash and I dont even talk to my family much anymore even though I am in the SAME HOUSE AS THEM

-trash social skills part two, someone blocked me for no apparent reason even though I have not done anything at all and I've talked to this person for months until about a month ago and  I just found out that she blocked me


-I keep getting into relationships too fast and they always end horribly with me eventually having to ghost them because of how the energy is no longer there

And not to mention all of the other shit going on in the world 

Man, oh man, 2020 has been a year ðŸ™ƒ

At this point, if you want to send death threats in the comments or in my dms I would greatly appreciate those and maybe I'll take those into consideration because I don't know how else I'll get better
