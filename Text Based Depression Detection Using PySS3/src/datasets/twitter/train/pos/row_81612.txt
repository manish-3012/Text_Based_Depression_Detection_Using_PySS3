That moment when youâ€™re household is showing Covid symptoms and your disgusting rat sister spits on you. And after 12 shouts of â€˜she spat on me!â€™ your dad replies with â€˜sheâ€™d never do thatâ€™ even though multiple people witnessed it, and the fact that sheâ€™s done it in the past and even spat in your food. Not to mention she hasnâ€™t brushed her teeth in about two weeks,showered in a month and is definitely going to get away with this. But itâ€™s ok because itâ€™s her birthday tomorrow and I might as well ruin it
