I'm super fucking nervous about getting transgender surgery? Hey. I'm agender and eighteen years old. I recently learned that I'm going to be getting surgery soon, and nyc lifting bans on domestic travel (though I think you just had to quarantine before that) means it's likely to happen even sooner. 

The surgery I'm getting is hysterectomy, and it will be the first step to getting my genitals entirely removed. I've had genital dysphoria all my life, and I really will be happier genitaless. But right now I'm super nervous. 

On a physical level I'm going to have an entire organ removed. It's such an extreme thing, and it seems like there is a lot of pain and medical issues that I need to go through in order to do this, even though I know it's something I have to do. And that's something that really scares me. 

There's also the fear of how I will appear to other people once my genitals are gone. I really don't want people around me thinking I'm a freak because I don't have genitals or because I removed them willingly. 

I really need your advice. Does anyone have recorces from other AFAB people who've had their genitals fully removed?
