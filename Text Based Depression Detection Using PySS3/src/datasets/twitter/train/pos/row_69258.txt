How to ask my parents about getting a therapist? I'm fairly young and I feel like I should go to therapy, but I would obviously need to ask my parents about it, how should I bring this up? My mother has had bad experiences with her therapists in the past, so it might be hard, but I still think it would help me. Should I bring it up to my dad first? What would I say?
