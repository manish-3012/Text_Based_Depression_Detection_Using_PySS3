I hate the fact that most Indians get good marks and bitch about it for context, I'm Indian, but my parent never enforced studies on me a lot, thus, my marks aren't all that good

but, my classmates get 72/80,75/80 and bitch about it

one time, a friend of mine got above 60 in an exam out of 70 and his mom scolded him

I personally would like it if my parents were strict in schooling like they are, but they aren't.make no mistake, they aren't bad parents, they just don't care much about my studies than they do about my behavior 

It's annoying to see it.I get that their parents beat them and shit, but why the hell are you sad about marks so high.I could study for 2 days straight and I wouldn't get marks so high
