My mom beat me up for the last time, its finally time that I do it.  earlier today I posted something about wishing me luck, since I was faking a class meeting. That didn't turn out so well. I got beat up so hard, right now, about 15 minutes after everything happened, it still hurts. I'm sick of it. Meetings make me look disgusting and awkward, and i'm not comfortable with it. my mom has just left the room, giving me very few time to write this.  My mom been beating me up for ages, it feels like domestic abuse, but I dont want to call the cops because I don't know what to do. Everyone in the house told my mom to stop beating me up, she didn't do anything. this is the first time I will say this, but nothings worth living anymore, my mom has threatened me to put me up for work. I don't give a shit, i'll be dead by then. Nothing is worth anything now, 1 Million dollars is nothing. Nothing matters anymore, im such a disappointment to my mom, she wouldn't care. No one would care if I died. So now, I say my supposed final goodbye to the world. It's been fun
