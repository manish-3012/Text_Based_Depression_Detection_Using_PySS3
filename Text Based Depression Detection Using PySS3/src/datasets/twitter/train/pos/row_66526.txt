I see all of these people saying, â€œif I lived here I would be so much happierâ€ To a certain extent if you not willing to be outgoing and exploring new things it will be the exact same. I live in Maine and absolutely live where I live. I live in a pretty small town, 20,000 people. I know so many people that hate it, there the same people that wonâ€™t leave there house. Like if I lived in Hawaii I would honestly be the same person but instead of snowboarding I would Surf. You canâ€™t keep making excuses. From like 13-50 yrs old you should be fit enough to do anything. Donâ€™t blame where you live on and waste your life. If you live in the cold you can snowboard, ski, Sled, Hike. If you live in the warmth you can swim, bike, run, explore. Just quit making excuses, I could drive to the 30 minutes to the beach and it would make my day. You can do it to! And no Iâ€™m not a super lucky rich person. My family is lower/middle class and I recently had a 10 hours spine surgery. Couldnâ€™t run, jump, bend, or lift more then 10 pounds for 6 months. Anyways if high made it this far maybe youâ€™ll take something out of it.
