i hate that my body is automatically seen as controversial/offensive iâ€™m getting ready to meet with my employers (at a tutoring organization) for the first time to drop off some paperwork, and iâ€™m wearing this kinda tight blue shirt that goes down to my collarbones. my mom then says i shouldnâ€™t wear it because it shows too much (not low enough to show cleavage at all, if that matters for context). she follows that up by saying if i were to tutor a 12 year old boy or something, he would find it distracting and the employers donâ€™t want that. i totally understand it, and itâ€™s not a hassle at all to just throw on a different shirt, but it just hurts to know how often iâ€™m simplified to my body, as an inherently sexual thing, when iâ€™m a whole human being lol.
