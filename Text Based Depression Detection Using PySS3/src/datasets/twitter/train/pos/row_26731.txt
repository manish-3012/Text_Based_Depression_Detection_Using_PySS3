Kid clothing I might be a little sensitive but who agrees with 8 year olds shouldnâ€™t be wearing chokers? Iâ€™m fine with people wearing choker at the age 14 but not younger I think it looks too sexual and too mature for kids,my parents let my little sister wear pretty much anything,chokers,tons of makeup and long ass fake nails. In my opinion she is too young to dress so mature and she keeps trying to wear like knee high stockings and oversized shirt to where you canâ€™t see her shorts, then she tryâ€™s to tie her shirts to wear her belly shoes and her parents donâ€™t do anything about itðŸ˜‘Does anyone agree that kids shouldnâ€™t be wearing stuff like that?
