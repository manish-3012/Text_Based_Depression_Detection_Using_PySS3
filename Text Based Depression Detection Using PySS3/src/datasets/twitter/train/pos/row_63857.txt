I'm still not 100% sure on this So I've been 18 for a few months and I was wondering about the age rule. Eventhough I'm 18 can I still be friends with girls under 18 as long as we arnt in a relationship? Before I turned 18 i had 2 friends who are 14 year old girls, can I still be friends with them? Thank you for answering if you do and have a good day
