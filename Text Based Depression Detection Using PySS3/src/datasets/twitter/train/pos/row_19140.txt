I need a bit of help. Yes, I know this post is very stereotypical and you guys will probably think that it's karma whoring, but please just hear me out.

So there's this girl I know, and we've been friends since the seventh grade, so for about 3 years now.  Gradually, during our years or friendship, I've grown more attracted to her, and have wanted to ask her out. I've hinted at the idea to her before, but she either didn't notice or was hinting back at me  that she wasn't interested. On top of that, there's a rumor going around that she's lesbian, which further complicates things.  It's honestly kind of a pain in my neck right now. I want to ask her out, but I'm scared that she's going to say no, which will ruin our friendship. What should I do?
