Anyone else realize That not one girl they have met has ever liked them in a romantic way? Like take that one girl for example that would always flirt with you until you found out they did that to everyone? The girl that â€œlikedâ€ you and sent that message was just pranking you and does not give one shit about you. Then when you finally get the courage to walk up and ask her out you find out she has 5 other boys that already asked her out. This is probably the reason I like quarantine, no need to get my heart crushed since I isolate from everyone.
