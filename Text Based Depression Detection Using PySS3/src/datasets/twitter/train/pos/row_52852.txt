Has this been figured out yet? (The r/askreddit AutoBot deleted my original post, so I guess Iâ€™mma just go ahead and ask it here.)

Is it possible to check the â€œChatâ€ feature on mobile browser? I donâ€™t have access to my PC until the day after tomorrow, so until then, I wonâ€™t know whatâ€™s been blowing up the notification chat (which says 9+).

Anyways, you get my point. (I think.)
