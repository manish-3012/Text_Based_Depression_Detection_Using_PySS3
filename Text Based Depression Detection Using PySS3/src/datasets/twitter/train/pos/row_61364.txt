Help - Need Money ($30) Iâ€™m not old enough to ask for money on the actual â€œhelpâ€ communities but I can work for it since itâ€™s partially my fault. While we were still in school around February I was doing a fundraiser for Key Club to donate money to fund the clubs service events by selling chocolate, 60 bars at $1 each. I left them on my desk and some kid stole 32 bars and gave them away, my fault for trusting that high school kids were mature enough to not steal from a fundraiser. I figured out who it was and he offered to pay. Well he gave me a $2 bill and promised to pay the rest â€œlaterâ€, corona break came and now weâ€™re out of school. Heâ€™s since blocked me on every social media and I owe $30 that I do not have to a club for community service. I would ask my parents but I feel bad asking them to pay for a mistake I made while theyâ€™re struggling to buy groceries. If you donâ€™t want to donate thatâ€™s totally okay but if you can leave tips on how I can make money quick and easy thatâ€™d be great. Also I have been trying to get a job for almost 2 years now, nobody wants to hire a teenager without work experience but I canâ€™t get experience without a job. And I hope you can trust that I am not a scam this is the absolute truth. Thank you!
