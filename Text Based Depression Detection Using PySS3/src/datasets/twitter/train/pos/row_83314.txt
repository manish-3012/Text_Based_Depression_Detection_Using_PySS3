My aunt died a month ago So basically the title, I broke down today and just decide to vent. My aunt died in her sleep and we donâ€™t know why, she didnâ€™t have any problems that night. When my grandma was shaking my aunt she turned her around and saw her face, it was really pale. When my grandma realized what happened she cried. And just to trash on my uncle for what he said Iâ€™m going to add this part in. When my grandma was crying, he just said,â€ I donâ€™t want to get involvedâ€ and went back to his room.
