I wanna stop but itâ€™s very tough Porn has been a problem for almost 5 years, not a problem in a since that stops me from getting stuff done, but in a way where it leaves me feeling like crap. Not the Normal post bliss crap, but just â€œagain? You said you would stopâ€ I would love to stop but my problem is that I like doing it. It feels great so I keep doing it, but mentally my mind is saying u still got time to stop...idk I think I just need to get out more cause living with my fam kinda restricts me from going places or I need like help help.
