Twitter locked my account Changed my birthday on my twitter account to the right one and it locked me out and won't let me have it back. You could've given me a warning wtf. They really just fucking yeet you huh

They want me to give my actual ID now and then I'm pretty sure they still wouldn't give it back because it'll just further prove that I wasn't 13 when I made the account.

Now I sad. Like it was just a Twitter account, but some cool people noticed me on there and now it's all gone with a button click

I've been considering getting a new account for awhile now so I'll do that but I'm just disappointed
