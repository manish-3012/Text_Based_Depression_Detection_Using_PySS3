Iâ€™m not sure about what classes to take in high school Iâ€™m still undecided about whether or not I should take all honors classes or not. On one hand, I like all the subjects that have an honors class available. But, it could be a lot of work and there are a bunch of clubs I want to join and other things I want to do. I also know that Iâ€™ll be sad if I feel like Iâ€™m missing out by not taking one of the classes. Iâ€™m considering summer classes since it might help me if I take Honors Chem.

Also, does anyone know about taking AP Human Geo? Iâ€™m not sure if I understand, but itâ€™s about finding out how location impacts people, right? Does it teach you things like how phones are made with cobalt and how it impacts the miners? How much reading and writing do you do?
