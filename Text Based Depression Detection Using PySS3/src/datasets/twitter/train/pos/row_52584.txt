I have life issues can someone help Hi strangers of Reddit

Iâ€™m not sure if this happens to anyone else but I get depressed at night but tonight was a lot worse

I was kinda just laying in bed and I just randomly thought that I just needed comfort and maybe a hug or something

Iâ€™ve had trust issues for about 6-7 months so I donâ€™t really know who to trust but none of you have anyone to expose me too so it doesnâ€™t really matter

I get often made fun of for my height and weight and donâ€™t really talk to people much

I had my first soccer practice today and so of my teammates jokingly made fun of me because I missed a save as goalie and with my long arms I shouldâ€™ve been able to save it

I have some swim friends but those are really my only friends that Iâ€™m close with at all but Iâ€™m not sure how long my swim team will continue due to school starting up and if I will keep in touch with them as much

Iâ€™ve also had a lot of stress with the upcoming start of school which has led to some anxiety and itâ€™s kinda just pent up inside

If anyone has any suggestions then feel free to comment

Thanks I guess!
