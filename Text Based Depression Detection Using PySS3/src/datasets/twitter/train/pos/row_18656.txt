I got some old southern advise It takes twice as long to build bridges you burn. 


Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills. 


Run far enough any youâ€™re bound to trip. 


Be around for the glory in the fall. 


If you get knocked down sometime you gotta hit the fence. 


Mess with the bull you get the horns.


And the last one: Make the most of your childhood. You only have one. 

Iâ€™ll explain the ones you donâ€™t understand.
