Small and useless rant about toast My sister keeps changing my toaster settings. I've done a lot of trial and error to see where I should put the dial to make the perfect toast but my sister keeps turning the dial wayyy down and so when I toast my bread it doesn't even cook at all and then I put it in for a second time and then it's burnt as fuck.

I confronted her about her dumb ass toaster settings and she says "Ah yeah I just put it in a second time but take it out halfway" 
What is that logic, why not have it perfect???

Anyways thanks for listening to my rant about toast
