Making a Diary like thing on Reddit Day 203 So, this is a weird day... This Morning a Friend wrote to me if i wanted a job at a convience store with him. I accepted and we are going to turn in our applicants soon. It feels quite weird making an applicant, but whatever. As Long as it goes well.

Other than that, i watched Brooklyn 99 most of the Day. At least season 6. I am almost done with it, and i think it is fine. It is not the best season, but even Then, it is fine.

I sadly have not done much more, but now i Need to do the rest of the batcave Challenge. Day 15. It is quite hard for some reason.

See ya tomorrow.
