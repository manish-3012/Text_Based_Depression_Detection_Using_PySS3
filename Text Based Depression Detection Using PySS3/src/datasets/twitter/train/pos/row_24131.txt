I had the worst day possible today. I tried to set up two of my friends and one of them fails to tell me until after the first date that she is into someone else and I had to break the news to my other friend who thought that the date went amazing.

I was supposed to register for two separate language exams and I faced a lot of issues while registering through my phone and it turns out I registered for one exam twice and paid twice.

I had to call some numbers and type out emails to get the fucking issues resolved and I still havenâ€™t heard back from them. My language teacher definitely hates me now because I am the only student causing so many problems.

My parents are pissed off at me like usual and I am stuck in my room because I canâ€™t deal with the glares. I decide to eat some saved up cookies but my mom had already eaten them and I know that itâ€™s better to keep my mouth shut then argue.

My laptop is in the service centre and apparently itâ€™s going to take a while so I am stuck with this phone until the last possible day of my exam.

Also I am single and definitely going to die alone. Lockdown fucking sucks and I canâ€™t even go out anywhere. I hate my life so much right now.
I know there are people who have it way worse but I am so tired of everything and everyone.
