My mom just agreed to spend $2500 on a PC and Iâ€™m freaking out right now Like I donâ€™t understand how or why she agreed so I basically know Iâ€™m getting a new PC how I know id that she just said â€œI put all the expensive ass stuff Iâ€™m my Amazon cart, why do you want to build a PC anyway, just buy oneâ€
