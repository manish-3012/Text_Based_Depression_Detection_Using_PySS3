I wanna start watching anime, any suggestions?  Iâ€™ve never watched anime. I wanna watch it in english (i hate reading subtitles). I prefer stuff with either (a)very strong storyline or (b) rom com type stuff (ik, iâ€™m very basic).                                                                         
I think a lot of people of this sub have already watched a lot of anime, would you like to recommend me something?
