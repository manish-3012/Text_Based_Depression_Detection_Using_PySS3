HEY! I'M BACK AFTER 2 WEEKS. so, uh, what's new on Reddit? what the title says. my mom pawned my computer 2 weeks ago (still don't have it back yet, but i'm using the computer of one of my neighbors), so i haven't been on here for 2 weeks, and i'm wondering if anything major like u/fuck_brain_cancer has happened while i was gone.
