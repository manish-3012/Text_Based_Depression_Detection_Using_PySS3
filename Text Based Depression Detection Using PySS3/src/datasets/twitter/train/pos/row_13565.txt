America probably wonâ€™t go to normal and get rid of Covid anytime soon

if youâ€™re single like me you more than likely wonâ€™t get a girlfriend or boyfriend until after high school

Biden may have won but a lot of things he is trying to change wonâ€™t happen because the Supreme Court and senate a conservative/republican heavy (pls donâ€™t have a political debate in the comments)

leading on people and cheating wonâ€™t get you a girlfriend or boyfriend people donâ€™t want that in another person

equality is not superiority 

youâ€™re gonna get made fun of in life you have to accept that

memes in r/ memes are not funny and only get worse when they are posted here

tiktok is not that bad youâ€™re just a Reddit nerd

a purposely made joke that was supposed to be funny because it was bad doesnâ€™t make it funny (like when people say aha thatâ€™s 69 funny sex number)

nobody really cares about your crush posts they are over posted here

this is for some certain people high heel converse are not the move (imo you might pull them off but still they are a no in my eyes)

yolos on Snapchat are annoying

not a single soul wants to see your post about anything sexuaI and nobody cares if you lost nnn
