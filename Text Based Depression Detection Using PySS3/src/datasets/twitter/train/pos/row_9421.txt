I came out to my parents! 
So, today i finally got the courage and told my parents that i'm trans! [Female to Male] I think it was the scariest and also the bravest thing i've done so far in my life? Despite my waterfall of bad thoughts they turned out to be really accepting and supportive of me, obviously they will need some time to adapt to the thought that i'm their son - but so far so good! We'll be searching for a gender therapist pretty soon, and i'm very excited for that. There is a looong and difficult road ahead of me, but if it's gonna make the quality of my life even slightly better, i'm into it whatever it takes. It just all feels so much better when after all these years i don't have to hide it so much anymore, kinda too good to be true.

Sorry i'm posting this on here, but i really wanted to share this somewhere. I'm actually super proud of myself, and you guys seem like nice people. 

Also i just wanted to mention that none of you should ever give up, there's been times when i've been completely convinced that i will absolutely never come out because thats just impossible and my parents would never accept me - the way it turned out just proves how little we know about what might and might not happen if we try. Never say never, don't give up on things that you want to accomplish because there is always a chance. Maybe that girl/boy you find pretty also finds you attractive? Maybe that one amazing skill isn't so impossible to learn? Perhaps that job you wish you had doesn't have to stay as your dream, and may become a reality if you just try? Think about it, how many opportunities we miss just because we don't believe in ourselves enough?


Anyways, have a good day fellow teens, don't forget to brush yo teeth!
