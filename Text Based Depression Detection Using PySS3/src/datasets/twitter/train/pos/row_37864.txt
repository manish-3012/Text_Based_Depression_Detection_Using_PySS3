I don't know anymore Life has been a shit hole for the last few months. I have over 30 missing assignments, my grades are slipping, my mental health and my mind are slipping, I have never felt more anxious, more depressed, more stressed out, more detached, and more lonely in my life I have never felt worse and more suicidal. I want to die.
