I indirectly killed a guy [Long] Sorry for bad English.

So, all begins when I moved schools a year ago, a friend of mine (letâ€™s call her friend1) also moved with me at the same school, so I wasnâ€™t all alone the first day, we met some guys that would later become our friends too, they were pretty cool when we first met, one of them (I donâ€™t want to tell the name so we are going to call him guy1) liked a girl (Letâ€™s call her girl1) this girl already rejected him a few times, but he kept trying, some weeks after entering this school, guy1 had his birthday party, he invited me but I couldnâ€™t go because of a very important test I had, guy1 planned to declare himself to this girl for like the 5th time, but guy1â€™s trick this time was to give her alcohol get her drunk and then declaring himself, his plan failed and he got rejected again. 

I wouldnâ€™t discover this after some time, when talking to this girl she told me what guy1 did, I didnâ€™t believe it at first, I didnâ€™t want to believe it, she also told me that guy1 hitted her with the â€œI canâ€™t live without youâ€ and the â€œYou are the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myselfâ€; some time later I was on a Discord call with guy1, we were playing some games and talking, it was at this point that I discreetly asked him if he ever tried to convince someone using alcohol, he didnâ€™t think a lot about that question and he said yes, after saying that he said something like: â€œwell, I tried, it didnâ€™t go as plannedâ€, I then asked something like: â€œTell me at least it wasnâ€™t about sexâ€, and he replies with: â€œOh, no, I have never raped anyone if thatâ€™s what you are asking forâ€. It was at this point that I thought Guy1 maybe wasnâ€™t someone I wanted in my life.

I stopped talking to guy1 for some time and went back to talking to friend1 more often, guy1 didnâ€™t like that I replaced him, so he started a fight with friend1, friend1â€™s parents didnâ€™t like this and they decided to take her out of school, they later moved back to their country so I havenâ€™t seen friend1 in a long time, we still chat in Discord some time though.

Itâ€™s been a long time and now itâ€™s 2020, Discord calls with guy1 became more often at the point it was strange if we didnâ€™t stay awake a single night until 5am, I also started talking to the girl a bit more, when guy1 discovered I was also chatting with girl1, he told me that she was actually chatting to every guy in school, girl1 at some point told me she had a crush on me, something that was pretty special, it was probably the first time a girl had a crush on me (At least that I knew of at the time), when I told guy1 about this, he told me that she actually went back to him and told him the same thing, at this point I trusted guy1 as friend so believed what he said at the time, so I started to chat less with her, that led to me talking more and more with guy1 at the point I actually chatted less with any of my friends, our Discord calls became so long they would easily last a whole day, some time later another girl (Girl2), told me that guy1 told her girl1 had a crush on me, I was so fucking angry at him for telling someone what I told him as a secret, I told him that, and blamed it on girl2 for asking, girl1 asked me why would I tell anyone about that, I tried to explain how it wasnâ€™t me the one that told girl2 about it, she then asks me if guy1 did, I was surprised she knew it was guy1, I told her that yes, guy1 told girl2, she then said something like â€œIâ€™m not surprised about thatâ€, to which I ask her why, she then tells me how guy1 actually started to insult her after she rejected him, how at the beginning he threatened to kill himself if she didnâ€™t become his girlfriend, and how after that he tried to make her think she was a bitch. 

At this point I started to put 2 and 2 together and was finally able to see how guy1 was manipulating me into him being my only friend, I was so angry I decided to go and ask him if what I thought he did was real, after some time of him denying me what I was saying he finally told me that he indeed tried to be my only friend, I was obviously angry at him, I told him I didnâ€™t want to talk to him anymore, and that I hoped I will never see him again, he then proceeds to hit me with the â€œIf it wasnâ€™t for you I would have killed myself a long time agoâ€, I told him I didnâ€™t care, I told him to go fuck himself, I told him I wasnâ€™t responsable for his life, and a bunch of other shit at the point he ended up crying, without any remorse I blocked him from WhatsApp, Discord, and any other way he had to contact me.

I finally went back to talk with my friends, all of them told me that itâ€™s weird I stopped talking to them, I never really told them why, it was few weeks back a friend from school told me he discovered guy1 killed himself, at first I didnâ€™t believe him, until I went to his auntâ€™s Facebook, where she posted about his nephew killing himself a week after our fight, he didnâ€™t leave a note, he didnâ€™t tell anyone, he just killed himself and no one knows what drove him into suicide. I feel like shit right now, I canâ€™t tell anyone I know, I donâ€™t know what to do, itâ€™s something I had to get off my chest somehow and writing this really helped me, please anyone what should I do?
