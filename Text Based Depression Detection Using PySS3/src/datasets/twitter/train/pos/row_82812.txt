Wanna know how to get rid of boners? I figured this trick out a long while ago. So I studied how the penis works (i was in the 5th grade by the way). The penis is a muscle in the human body which means that it works the same way as the other muscles, it needs blood to get hard. So if your ever turned on just flex one muscle in your body ex. Bicep, thigh, calf, for at least one minute. What happens is that the blood your focusing on the muscle you decided to flex is taking blood from your penis and putting it into the muscle you wanted to flex. If you have questions I will try my best to answer.
