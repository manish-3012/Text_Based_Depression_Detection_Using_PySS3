I will get hate for this, but it is my opinion I am christian, so I don't support gay people, but I respect them because they are HUMANS. If I don't support doesn't mean I hate them, we are learnd not to hate people, but I don't condone any bad things done to gay people, like bully them, beat them up or kill them. If you respect me as christian, I will respect you as part of LGBT community.
