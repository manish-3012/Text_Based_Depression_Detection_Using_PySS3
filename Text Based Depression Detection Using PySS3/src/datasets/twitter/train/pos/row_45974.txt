basically a repost but i hate my situation and also love it so pls read and give me advice im talking to 2 girls rn (letâ€™s say sarah and katie)
sarah and i r friends and she likes me n ive always thought she was cute but idk if i like her (personality is extremely important to me). we talk a bit but the past few times weâ€™ve hung out (in a group) we havenâ€™t really had the chance to actually talk. i wanna hang out with her 1on1 but sheâ€™ll wanna hook up probably and if i do it and end up not picking her ill feel like an asshole. also if i reject her trynna hook up then sheâ€™ll be sad. with katie i dmed her for her snap (mutual friends tho) and have been getting mixed signals for the past 2 month until she asked me out. weâ€™re hanging out with one of her friends bc sheâ€™s really shy and sheâ€™s really cute and so far her personality seems good but i wonâ€™t know for sure until we hang out in a few days. basically Iâ€™m stuck between 2 girls and obviously hanging out with 2 at once is kinda fucked even if nothing happens other than talking. like what if they find out about eachother before i drop one? i wanna get to know each of them but i also donâ€™t wanna talk to 2 girls at once so if anyone has any input on what the FUCK to do iâ€™d really appreciate it lol


also I love it because Iâ€™ve never had 2 options especially 2 that are both my type so yeah
