So I like my closest friend, again... So in 2019 I had a huge crush on her (At the time we were friends but not super close) I was too big a coward to ask her out in real life so I waited until summer and asked her over text (Huge mistake) she obviously said she would rather be friends.

I decided I should better myself and I stopped thinking about relationships, and for the past 8 months I've been like that. 

Me and her have gotten even closer and we both consider eachother really close friends now, and because of this I've kind of started liking her again.

Its made me feel super bad, because as much as I would like to ask her out I would never want to jeopardize my only "real" friendship because of it.

I need others opinions on it, feel free to ask questions and feel free to criticize me
