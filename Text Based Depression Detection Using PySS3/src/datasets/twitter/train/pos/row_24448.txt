No idea if this is a repost, but we should totally do something about people on this subreddit that are under 13. Iâ€™ve seen people literally comment on posts here â€œim 11 lolâ€. I feel like the mods should work on a filter system where they get notified and can investigate when someone says â€œIâ€™m (insert age under 13)â€. This could be uncool of me to say but this is just my thought about it.
