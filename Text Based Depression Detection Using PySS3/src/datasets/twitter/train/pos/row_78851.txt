It's time to stop acting like Trump is our guy Sorry if I am being political on this subreddit, I just feel like having to vent here. But if you're **a confederate, a nationalist, or a paleoconservative**, then I hate to break this to you; but Donald Trump is not representative of any of these three kinds of traditional conservatism. During his four years in office, he contributed more to cultural and capital degeneracy than Barack Obama. He plotted attacks against the South more than four times as much as Obama. He stole the incomes of most pastors to fund Harvard University and the HBCUs - the Republicanically correct way of explicitly saying he is pro-affirmative action and pro-BLM. He gave more money to the BLM and antifa protesters six times as much as Obama did. He paid George Soros to control police forces who are out there damaging the lives of people like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, instead of simply giving them the opportunity to volunteer at The Salvation Army (to cure depression) and giving homeless people free Chick-fil-A sandwiches.

Trump literally sent his two sons, Eric and Donald II, to w\*r to eat the M\*slims, Ar\*b Chr\*\*tians, and Arm\*nians who had their lands col\*nized/b\*mbed using Isr\*\*li-Z\*\*ni\*t and T\*\*kish-Erd\*g\*nist aid. Trump did MORE to promote the red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet agenda in kids' shows like *Sesame Street* and *Blue's Clues &amp; You* than Obama and Clinton did COMBINED.

Trump's entire administration actually did more to evict nuclear families than Obama's, Bush's, and Clinton's administrations did twice as combined! Trump himself raised over $600 trillion in financial student debts, while not caring about the Nordic countries that are literally in poverty due to neocon war hawks like Mike Pence and Dick Cheney giving aid to Is-Ra-HELL to poison the underprivileged, the starving. Christ goes completely against this.

Trump never ran on a Christian platform, contrary to his supporters. Neither did Obama. If anything, a true Christian would support most of the social and fiscal Pinochetist policies, along with vivid thinking skills, rather than critical ones. Abolish public schooling, rather than promoting degenerate "school choice." That is exactly why I am writing in Tucker Carlson for the 2024 presidential election *twice* (midterm and final-term), with Joe Rogan's name NEXT to Carlson's (Rogan for VP).
