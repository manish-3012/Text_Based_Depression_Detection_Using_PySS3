Help Help Help Help Please Help Ok so basically, like, there's something in our roof. And it creeps me the fuck out. I think it got in there after our roof got remodeled about 2 months ago, and I thought it would've died by now, but it HASN'T. It keeps me up at night and the scariest part is there's a hole in my room closet that leads to the attack, and I'm so paranoid it's gonna come out and attack me. I want my parents or SOMEBODY like an exterminator or whatever, to come and get rid of it, but my parents said it'll eventually die soon and they're not spending any money just because I'm the only one worrying about it. I really thought it should've died by now but it's still scratching around up there and I'm afraid I'm gonna wake up one day with it on my bed. I know it's probably unrealistic but I can't help it what do I do.

Tl;DR Am scared of small animal in my roof will attack me. Parents won't do anything. What do I do
