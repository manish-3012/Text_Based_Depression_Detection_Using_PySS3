How can I make my anxious/depressed cousin feel loved &amp; welcomed at my house? Every year my(27F) cousin(16F) comes to stay with my husband(33M), myself, and our daughter(1F). Iâ€™ve been closely involved in her life since she was born. We share a close bond, and I suppose most would compare me to the â€œcool auntâ€ memes (even though Iâ€™m not her aunt).  She deals with anxiety &amp; depression, and takes meds nightly for it. 


This trip is a bit different because my parents are staying with us (49F, 60M) for a few days overlapping with my cousinâ€™s stay.


I can tell that my sweet cousin is INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. She has been staying in her room  (yes, she has a room at our house) for 75% of her 3 day visit so far. She is not talking much to anyone, even when we try to make generic conversation with her (howâ€™s school/work/hobbies/etc?).  Sheâ€™s blatantly ignoring people talking to her. When she does come out of her room, she stays on Snapchat/IG/TikTok/Netflix. 


How can I support her? Iâ€™ve asked her and she insists she is fine (while crying). Iâ€™ve offered hugs, leaving her alone.. Iâ€™ve invited her to do the things we are doing (going for walks with the baby + dog, trips to the store/outdoor shopping/etc). I can tell sheâ€™s very uncomfortable with the extra company (she was warned of before coming), and feel so bad.
