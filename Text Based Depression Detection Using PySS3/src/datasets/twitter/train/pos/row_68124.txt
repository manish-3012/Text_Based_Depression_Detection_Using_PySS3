My Fucked Up, Bipolar Life: Day 3 Yesterday's Recap: Had a very relaxing day letting my inner child come out. It was nice and I didn't let my brain think too much. I was all around pretty happy and enjoying life. 

Today: Not muched has changed, it was also a pretty nice and relaxing day. Had to go to school which really hurts me mentally, but I digress. I usually like to start my school day off with a hug (there are only two people in the school that I am completely honest with when it comes to my mental health) and I have the parking spot next to one of them so I usually wait for her to show up to get my hug. Well, she was late today and I didn't get my hug. Which was ok because I'd knew I'd see her at the end of the day. I didn't really talk to anyone too much today, just tried to focus on not getting in my own head. It was raining all day and I didn't get my hug at the end of the school day either which sucked. I was all around generally tired and mostly slept after school, but im not feeling too bad. So i count today as a W. The day was quite a bore, but, I kept myself busy and kept this good mood I've been in the past 3 days after my breakdown 4 days ago. But, I'm feeling good and these journals should keep writing themselves if I stay on top of it. Goodnight yall!
