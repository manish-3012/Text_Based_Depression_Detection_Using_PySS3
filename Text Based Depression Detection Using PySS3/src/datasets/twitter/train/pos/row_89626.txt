I think I just messed up a relationship So Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for awhile (during school and through summer and quarantine) and a few weeks ago we started â€œdating.â€ Well a week after that she told me that she had realized that she is asexual. I told her that I didnâ€™t mind and that itâ€™s perfectly fine. Fast forward to today and I chat for a few minutes and then send a super long message explaining that I still love her and that we can still date even though she is asexual, if we still love each other in a other ways. Well I sent that and she hasnâ€™t responded for over 10 minutes (she usually responds instantly) and I think I overstepped. I am aware that asexuality doesnâ€™t just apply to sexual orientation, but I donâ€™t fully understand it. I donâ€™t know what to do and I feel I just ruined a great friendship. I really do love her what do I say Iâ€™m freaking out?
