Truth Or Dare Well, I was just at my friends house and whoops?

Like we were playing truth or dare, and one of the dare questions (on an app) was "say something dirty to your friends) so I (15F) turn to my left, and my friend is there already looking awkward. I just grin and put my hand on his cheek and say "I love the way you feel, but I'd like it even more if you could feel me." He goes red and just yells at me. 

I burst out laughing. Next I go to my other friend and just look at her, she already looks confused. She didn't hear the dare, she was on her phone. So, I do the same. I put my hand on her cheek and lean in, and then the guy pushes me off and goes "Dee, quit it!" 

Then I laugh again. They didn't do any of those dares, only I was woman enough to, but it was just weird when I went to hug my friend. He kept turning red and saying it was awkward now. 

Especially after the dare where I had to kiss his CHEEK. HE WOULDNT TALK TO ME T\~T

So, now. I'm like...Embarrassed? Like did I over step is boundries? I don't know. He won't text me back.
