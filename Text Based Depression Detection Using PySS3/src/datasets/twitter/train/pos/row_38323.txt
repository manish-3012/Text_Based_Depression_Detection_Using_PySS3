Which video would you be interested in seeing the most? Iâ€™m starting a YouTube channel, and Iâ€™m trying to decide what my first video is going to be about. Iâ€™m not sure if thereâ€™s a better sub to ask this question on, so Iâ€™m just asking it here lol. 

Anyways, what would you find the most interesting? 

- The history of incels and the self-loathing that turns people into mass shooters 

- How Rorochan is being remembered, and how your actions affect your legacy 

- Livestream suicides, and why people do them

- Something else (I need video ideas, and I would really appreciate it if someone gave me another idea)
