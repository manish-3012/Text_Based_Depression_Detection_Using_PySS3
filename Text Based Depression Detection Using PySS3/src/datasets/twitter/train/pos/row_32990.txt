I resent my friends. Theyâ€™re massive assholes to me and when I call one of them out on it individually theyâ€™ll all gang up on me to prove that iâ€™m wrong. They were going to a mall when it wasnâ€™t safe too and i said they probably shouldnâ€™t go and they acted like I was some massive scumbag and made some stupid meme about how iâ€™m trying to destroy there plans. They know I like this one girl that they donâ€™t care about but they constantly hit on her just to fuck with me. Theyâ€™re massive assholes and I hate them for it. The only reason iâ€™m friends with them is because everytime I just want to leave and not look back I remember how close we used to be, theyâ€™re the best friends iâ€™ve ever had, but now I hate them and they probably subconsciously hate me. The whole situation sucks but I donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever have friends as close as them so I donâ€™t want to leave. What the fuck do i do???
