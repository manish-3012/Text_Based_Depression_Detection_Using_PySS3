a tale of djungelskog â€œwake up, little oneâ€

you can feel his gaze before you even open your eyes

you sense him watching over you with a benevolent eye

he is all-knowing. he is all-powerful

"do not be afraid," he says. his voice is comforting and you relax

you trust him

he is the essence of good

you sense something else in him, however... 

evil

he senses your confusion

"all things must be balanced, my child"

"read these instructions and assemble this couch"

you know that if you fail, you may not be worthy of living

it is gods game of yahtzee

we are his dice

his comforting presence keeps your mind clear as you assemble the couch

there is nothing in your head

there is nothing in your head

You assemble with care and diligence as if your life depends on it...

...because it does

you are his pawn

building his thrown

an ikea couch with a scandinavian name

a mere piece of a universe your puny mortal mind cannot even begin to comprehend

Ikea is another dimension entirely

that is why space seems altered when you enter djungelskog's domain

Suddenly you find yourself in a strangely familiar warehouse full of home decor

and the prices are so low

"you have earned these discounts, little one"

you turn around and see djungelskog sitting on the couch you had just assembled

did i pass his test? you think as you look around

a familiar voice floats through the air. â€œyes you have, child. there is no need to worry anymoreâ€

â€œyou have become a member of the Ikea family and now you will earn even more discountsâ€

you wake up in a cold sweat

was that a dream?

confused, you get out of bed and walk into the kitchen for some water

you freeze

you look to your right and there djungelskog is

sitting on the couch you made while in the limbo

he says

"I will always be watching over you, my child"

"you are safe"
