Man,I was a weird type of bully You see,everyone has that image of a bully with his cronies and him dunking a weakling in toilet and just being supermean generally........but I wasn't like that ,sure I teased my weaker classmates with cutting remarks and caused them public humiliation which caused them to cry BUT......I felt bad for it and to make up for it ,I sat with them at lunch and became friendly for that day with them.....and if some other bully tried to pick on the weaklings I picked upon,well they went crying to the principal(even in high school,it was surprising to say the least)because,I would beat the other bullys up....also,the weaklings were invited to my birthday party (which was the biggest yearly affair of the class)and they came too,and there was a sight where the bullys and weaklings played and joked together,even if for a night.....so yeah I'm weird that way
