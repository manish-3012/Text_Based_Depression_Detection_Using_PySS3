GOG is worst fcking game installer So I wanted to download witcher 3 that I have on cd. I downloaded it on my pc and it ask me â€ždo you want to have it on GOG? It gives u shit ton of thing" I was like hell yeah and I clicked ok
GOG open and it fucking force me to download 40 GB again even that I have this fucking game on pc you understand this shit?
