A girl called to attention a group chat where boys were sharing girls nudes without their knowledge, and the majority of responses are blaming the girls for sending them in the first place. Jesus Christ just why are people like this?? Just because the sending of nudes gives the other party the opportunity to blackmail you doesn't take away their free will and force them to do so. No ones saying what the girls did was smart, just hold the guys accountable ffs.

And no, it's not just one person saying "maybe don't do that", MOST, out of 65 + 16 + 300 comments (there were 3 posts) are saying the girls were idiots without even mentioning the boys being held accountable. When people respond "yea it was a bad idea, but the boys are still to blame" their responses have been "feminist always playing the victim" "you have no idea what laws you're referring to. Sit down" and most commonly, "this all could have been prevented if the girls just refused to send them"
