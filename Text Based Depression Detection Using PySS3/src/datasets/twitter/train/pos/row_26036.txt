2 in 1 Appreciation Post u/mistercakelol has to be one of the kindest and most wholesome users I've met on the internet in general. And I really do mean it, I have never met a person as kind as him. So thanks for making me happy that way.


u/gamerdude9999 is another user that I think is one of the nicest people I've ever met, either he is in the comment section, or there for you personally. He is a very epic gamer, and an awesome person. Thanks for being there for /new.


Both of these people have helped in some way with some issues that have been going on with me, so I figured I'd needed to make this post. Thank you the both of you if you are reading this, you are legends :)
