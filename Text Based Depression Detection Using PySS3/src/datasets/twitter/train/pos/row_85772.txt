This is prob gonna sound rly bad especially since these type of posts always end up in hot But like people are literally asking for pity by being like oh I havenâ€™t cut in so long. Like good for you but what do you want. A praise? Like bruh I get it we all have hard times, I went through stuff too in ninth grade and cut but I didnâ€™t tell anyone. Nobody knew because I was doing it because I was sad not cuz I wanted attention. Okay i guess itâ€™s not really my business what people post but big time it makes me cringe. Like your seriously trying to publicize getting better? Why? All you get is karma. If you want real support go tell your friends who can actually be there to help you. I feel like Iâ€™m coming off too strong, I donâ€™t mean it in a rude way. If you guys have any opposing views feel free to argue w me.
