What Do I Do?!?! So there is a girl I use to have a crush on in 8th grade so almost 2 years ago, me and my friends are friends with her we would talk with her in a group chat just about everyday I would talk to her at school and we were good friends, and so like I said I had a crush on her she was just so cute and funny but then she moved right before I was gonna tell her we still talked to each other in the group chats but that's it then we just stopped talking to her for a while then I sent her a text telling her how I had a crush on her, She said that was sweet but she was not looking for a relationship and she had moved anyways but she hasn't moved very far maybe like 5 miles away, then we just stopped talking to her but then recently we added her to our discord server and we have been talking and playing games together and now my feelings for her are back and I don't know what to do??

I don't wanna ruin our friendship or anything but she didn't really say she didn't feel the same way about me when she said she wasn't looking for a relationship at the time so does that mean something???

I don't know man girls are just so confusing I need some advice on what I should do or should I just stay in the Friendzone cause I really don't wanna ruin our friend ship if she doesn't like me and that would just be awkward for both of us.

HELP
