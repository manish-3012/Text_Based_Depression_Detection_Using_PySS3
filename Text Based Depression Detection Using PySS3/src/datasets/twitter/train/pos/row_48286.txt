I miss playing the saxophone... Last year was my first year in high-school. My father registered me in the school he works at, and thankfully he's beloved there. When he introduced me to the music teachers one of them offered me to teach me playing tge saxophone. My father and I thought it would be lovely, and it was. I took it super seriously and according to my teacher I was super quick at learning. I got the basics and everything in less than 2 weeks. And I was able to play Alone-by Alan walker in about a month. Even the head teacher (a quite famous musician irl) was impressed and applauded. I didn't know that he was famous back then and was confused why my teacher was excited that he applauded. I wad gonna play in a concert that the minister was gonna attend and I was even gonna play solo. We practiced hard and 2 weeks before the concert Covid became a thing, and the concert was canceled. Since then my life is empty. I wish I'll be able to play the saxophone with my teacher again and maybe there would be another concert before I go to college.

PS: Nope, I can't afford buying one, at least not in the time being.
