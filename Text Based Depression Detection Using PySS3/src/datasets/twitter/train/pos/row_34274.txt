Okay so here's a thing I'm confused about. To preface, I'm a 17M, and on mobile, so sorry for formatting errors.

Right okay, so basically, I'm not that in tune with emotions, it takes quite a bit to make me laugh, and even more to make my cry. Recently I finished Season 10 of Dr Who (Peter Capaldi's), and the last episode touched me, I cried a bit when Clara came back, even though it was only for a few seconds. Then just recently, I listened to Lewis Capaldi's - Someone you loved, and I cried like hell. I'm quite confused about what to do because this has never happened before. Right now I'm still shaking whilst writing this and still quite on the verge of crying again.

Any help/advice/assurance that this is normal would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
