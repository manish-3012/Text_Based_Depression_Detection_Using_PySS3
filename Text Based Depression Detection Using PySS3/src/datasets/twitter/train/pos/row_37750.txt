I'm pulling my first official all nighter I realized I would only get 3 hours of sleep if I went to bed before my Zoom classes, so I just decided to stay up all night and eventually, all day as well.

The closest I've ever gotten to this was hour of sleep before school in 4th grade, so I'm not sure if I can last.

Wish me luck, fellas.
