a way i could possibly meet a girl? (im just bored and feel like writing, sorry if wasting anyone's time...)

Ive been getting a bit into coding for websites and shit. im using this website (known as [code.org](https://code.org)) and learning a bit on how to code for websites and shit.

i was thinking about how if i really want to, take some coding classes so that i could meet some friends and possibly a girl. im not sure what i want to do atm, since we got covid-19 and all that dumb shit.

hopefully, my journey will be successful one day...
