I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE SOME FOR ME! I made some chocolate fudge, about a pound of it and I told my roommate that he could have some but he has to leave some for me. 
I come home today to see my roommate on the couch holding the empty container of fudge in one hand and the last piece of fudge in the other. And then he looks me straight in the eyes and eats it! Wtf dude that was a fucking pound of chocolate and you couldn't save one piece for me!
Why must my roommate be like this
