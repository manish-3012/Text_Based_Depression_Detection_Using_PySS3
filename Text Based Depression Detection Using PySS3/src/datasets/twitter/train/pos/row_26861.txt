Yiddish has some of the best curse words you'll ever hear Here's one as an example:
When someone makes you really angry, tell them that you wish them to be a lightbulb; hanged during the day and burning during the night. 

You can look for more in google :)

Edit: some grammatical changes because I'm an idiot
