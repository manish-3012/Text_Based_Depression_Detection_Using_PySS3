Are the levels of anxiety Iâ€™m feeling normal? I started school a few weeks ago and for those weeks I have been incredibly, incredibly stressed. I cry almost every night, Iâ€™ve been having trouble getting to bed, I feel nauseas, I feel generally horrible lately. I almost had a breakdown at work because of the amount of homework I have and I just canâ€™t do this anymore.

I talked to my dad a while ago (who has diagnosed anxiety) and he said I was fine. I genuinely do not feel fine, and Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™ve been slowly slipping into a dark place. For example, I used to text my friends everyday, and now I barely even check my phone. I feel so overwhelmed, and to be honest my schedule isnâ€™t insanely busy.

I work four days a week, and have 2 completely free days, and one mostly free day, I only go to class three days a week, for a total of eight hours (for the whole week), and I have about 3 hours of homework each week for each of my 5 classes. I have freetime, albeit not much, and I usually dedicate one day of the week to family stuff. I shouldnâ€™t be feeling this way, I have no reason to, and I feel so dramatic and weak willed. Am I? Or should I try to talk to my parents about talking to someone about this?
