Oh my God I'm actually doing it I bought my friend his favorite manga, since he could only get the 2nd book so im buying the 1st, and its coming in tomorrow or Thursday.

He has no idea he's even getting a gift from me but oh my God its giving me so much excitement for me to give it to him on Thursday or Friday (or in 2 weeks depending whether or not one of our friends tests positive for corona).

I cant believe this is happening. Yayyy!
