Message to my crush So there's this guy I've a few months ago, in a summer a camp. I'm a male and I never had such emotions to any other guy before, and I never had such strong emotions to any girl either. I don't have any ways of reaching him so I thought I could try here on Reddit.

So, Hey Pumbaa (His camp name) it's me Linnorm (My camp name) seeing the text above you might be surprised and I totally understand that. If you don't share these feeling or have a gf (or bf) I would understand, but I need to see your face once again. Please, if not as Bf let's just go out as friends (while staying 2m apart though) I just need it, it's been difficult times and I can't not think about you so please, if you see this post dm me.
