Im actually happy? So as you can see near my name it's "my day" and I just realized that my plans for today are to spent time with my ***girlfriend*** baking a pie and watching movies... Yes a girlfriend!!! I don't even know when it happened, we were just 2 friends playing minecraft and now we've been dating for almost 2 months. And to think that I was so close to commit the non living just some days before we started playing.... I guess what I want to say with this is that even tho you are depressed and you don't believe in any of those "everything will be alright" spechees that your friends or therapist tells you, which I personally never did. It will! Things will be alright, maybe not perfect, maybe not even great, but at some point it will be alright! I don't expect anyone to believe but I belive for you!!

And now I go back to lurking reddit without posting anything for a year! So long comrades!
