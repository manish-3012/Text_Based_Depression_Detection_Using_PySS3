Idk title So there is a girl Iâ€™m talking with,( Im a boy btw ) she keeps asking these type of questions: â€œ So... do yiu have a gf? â€œ and say that a friend of her wanted to know cuz she â€œlikesâ€ me. Yeah no way thats true. She always wants to start a conversation and she NEVER wants to end it. I gotta tell her I need to do somethinâ€™ else. Idk I think she might like me but I aint sure. Wtf do you think guys?
