Iâ€™ve been asked out twice... and both times I said â€˜noâ€™ Let me explain, I must have the worse luck every. So letâ€™s start...

First time: During a work experience placement, me and this girl got on for the whole week. Got home as she found me on Facebook and asked me out, â€˜letâ€™s get to know each other moreâ€™ at that time we lived like an hour and a half drive apart. So that was my reason of saying no, the journey would be terribly wrong each time. We still speak and have a laugh, but sheâ€™s got someone else now. 

Second time: Very recently, been speaking to someone in the year below me since the start of lockdown and had a good laugh. Just two weeks ago she started asking â€˜how do you feel about me?â€™ And instantly I thought, I know whatâ€™s happening here. But I had to say â€˜noâ€™ again since Iâ€™m moving away (like 160 miles) to uni and it really wouldnâ€™t have worked. 

So I donâ€™t know why people ask be out at the worst times, hopefully I get better luck in the future. Wonâ€™t lie regret saying no the first time though.
