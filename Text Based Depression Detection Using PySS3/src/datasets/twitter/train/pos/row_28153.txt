Alright. Alright. I Need Hair Advice. 
I got a haircut the other day. I wanted to try an undercut. I like it. Additionally, my barber said it suited my face shape rather well.

For the most part, everything has been fine. The one problem I am having is it doesnâ€™t want to stay up. I got a classic undercut. Itâ€™s supposed to go over my head. 

Itâ€™s long enough. Iâ€™ve tried two different techniques.

Any advice?
