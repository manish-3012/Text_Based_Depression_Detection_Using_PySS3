Hear me out on this one. Let me preface this with I do not disagree that sexism towards men is still sexism and that white lives matter.

But saying that sexism towards men is still sexism is like saying white lives matter at a BLM rally. Yes, it's true, but it has never been in doubt. Men have always been the predominant sex, just as in the Western countries white is the predominant race. So while sexism towards men IS still sexism and white lives DO matter, be careful about saying it all the time because those statements have never been in doubt, whereas blacks and women have been suppressed.

Please dont kill me for saying "Blacks"
