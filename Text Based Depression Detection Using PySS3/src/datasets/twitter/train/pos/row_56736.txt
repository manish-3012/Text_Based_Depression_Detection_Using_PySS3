How do I tell my crush I like him? I (f15) have a crush on a very good friend (m15). I think he might like me back and I kind of want to confess my feelings to him.

I want to tell him in real life. Should I ask him to come with me to talk sometime? I feel like thatâ€™s a bit too â€œofficialâ€, like, itâ€™s really suspicious to the other people. Should I just wait till weâ€™re alone? And if that happends, what do I say? 

â€œI think I might like you, but if you donâ€™t feel the same I can just ignore itâ€ is what I came up with. I really donâ€™t want to ruin our friendship, since he means a lot to me. How do I tell him?? I want to take it slow and stuff, but I have no idea how to tell him I like him
