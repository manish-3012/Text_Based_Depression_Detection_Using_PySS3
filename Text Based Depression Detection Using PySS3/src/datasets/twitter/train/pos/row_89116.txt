I'm pretty sure I just made my whole class laugh I was in the bathroom with my phone (I always take it with me, idk if it's normal) and the English teacher called me up to answer, so I unmuted and the convo went like this
Me: NOT NOW TEACHER IM IN THE BATHROOM
Tr: what?
Me: IM IN THE BATHROOM
*my friends start laughing, probably alongside my everyone else in my class, who were all muted*
Z (my friend): HAHAHAHA +10 RESPECT
A (other friend): HAHA GOOD ONE
Y (my brother): *straight laughter*
And one of my other friends says in discord that he's crying of laughter.
Don't know why I shared this, but I did, and it's out there now.
