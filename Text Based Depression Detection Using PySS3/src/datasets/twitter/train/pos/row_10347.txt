"You see, i wont talk about these claims without my lawyer, I think all of you people are crazy"

"well if you think normal people are crazy then you are probably being gaslit"

"well i don't know what that means, pass me a cigarette, i dont smoke but i like the head rush"

*he hands you a cigarette*

"Now you could sit here and plead the 5th all day but the truth is we have witnesses and we have you on tape. But if you confess now well get you off easy okay. Im here to help buddy. Not many people understand people like you but i know you are not a bad kid, this is a silly decision you made and it doesn't need to be your life"
