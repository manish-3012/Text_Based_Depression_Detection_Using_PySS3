I feel like my only chance of getting a boyfriend is to be sorta like a sugar daddy where I find a young boy around 18 or so and his parents are homophobic so he comes to live with me free of charge and I buy him some stuff but not anything crazy Yea that's what I see happening the way I'm investing in crypto and shit and how absolutely nobody wants me right now
