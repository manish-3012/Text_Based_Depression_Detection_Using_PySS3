Would yâ€™all be down with helping me out ratio my homophobic friend on twitter? A close friend and I are both Twitter. The thing is that heâ€™s homophobic. We get into arguments about it sometimes because of it, but we still friends. Today, I retweeted a pro-lgbt tweet, and he replied with disapproval.

Out of shits and giggles and also implying a message, I wanna out-ratio him with a pride flag. However, I need your help to do so. I didnâ€™t send it yet because I wanna make sure enough people are on board, but in about an hour Iâ€™ll see how many weâ€™ve got and determine if we should do it.
