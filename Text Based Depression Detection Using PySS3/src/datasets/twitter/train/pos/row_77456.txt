Right, I am trying to organize an event So, here's the basic idea. any people who can make the time, are on a zoom call (cams off but mics on). I, (the host) shall open netflix and we shall all watch Shrek on a screenshare. This isn't happening now so the call will be on a day which will be announced in the future. so the movie/call will be on a certain day at 1:00 PM GMT. I will keep you posted on which day it shall be
