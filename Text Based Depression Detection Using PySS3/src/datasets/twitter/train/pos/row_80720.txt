Why arenâ€™t I happy? I got the highest score in my class for a test- the only one to get full marks, but I got accused of cheating. I brushed it off, but everyone began asking me for help. I felt like I was giving them wrong answers and now Iâ€™m stressing out to the point Ik not studying instead of sleeping. My anxiety wonâ€™t leave me alone Iâ€™m until I know everything for the test tomorrow. Iâ€™m so tired but I canâ€™t sleep, because I canâ€™t fail.
