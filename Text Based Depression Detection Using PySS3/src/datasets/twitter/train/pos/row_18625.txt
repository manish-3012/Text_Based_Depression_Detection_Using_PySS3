Why are group homes so abusive?? I live in a group home and it's really really overprotective. Most of the dickheads who work here are abusive child predators who only work here for the money and abuse us teenagers and get away with it because there's no parents to witness it, the fucking stuffed shirt manager is too aloof busy doing shit in the office, and obviously the cops or social services will never believe us. I've experienced loads of different shit.

* Phone confiscated because i deleted Qustodio
* Not allowed to go out unchaperoned because I would run away often and shoplift
* Not allowed a bike because I could run away quicker on that
* Money took off me because I ate all the strawberries, leaving none less for anyone else
* Slut-shamed
* Karen mirrored by individual habits just to provoke the shit out of me
* Even yelled at or physically restrained on some occasions
