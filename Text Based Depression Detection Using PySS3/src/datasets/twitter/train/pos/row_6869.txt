I'm finally wearing sweatpants again! I don't know how long it will last, but the weather has been pretty cool lately, and it's finally starting to feel a little cold!


I love baggy clothes. Anything loose-fitting is my go-to outfit, and I'm so hyped to finally break out all my sweaters and hoodies and sweatpants!
