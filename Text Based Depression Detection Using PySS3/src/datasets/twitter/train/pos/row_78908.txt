Does anyone else have anxiety but not social anxiety? This is a weird place to ask this but I figured since weâ€™re the same age group Iâ€™d get accurate answers lol

Like I have awful anxiety about school, my job, my future, my family, et cetera...

...but I donâ€™t have any problems with talking to people, talking in front of crowds, and entering social situations lol
