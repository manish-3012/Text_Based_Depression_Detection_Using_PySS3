Do you think i should write to my ex on her BD? First of all, if i could ask, please only serious answeres, 

Basically in big shortcut. It's been over a year after my ex broke up with me and something around 8 months after we completely broke off contact, altough we stopped our relationship pretty peacefully. our friendship ended because of a big argue, I just couldn't make myself speak to her after one thing she told me.

And now there is present. She's still important for me altough we completely broke off contact. I want best for her, and her birthday is in jenuary. I want to somehow let her know that i remember about it or something. I don't want to renew our contact, i just want to wish her happy Birthday like on discord or steam or just maybe i should send her short letter with wishes, but i don't know if she's maybe mad at me for disapearing from her life so suddenly. But at the same time she might miss me as i miss her, i think she's more rational person than emotional. 

I also deep inside of me want her to write to me to wish me happy birthday which is in March and they're my 18th so it's i think most important day so far in my life.

Do you guys think I should write to her on "discord" at this day, or send her a letter as i still have her current Address or anything that you guys would suggest
