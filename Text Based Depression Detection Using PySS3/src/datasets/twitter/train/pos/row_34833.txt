Goodbye r/teenagers As the title says I'm gonna be leaving this community, not because I have to but because I'm turning 20 in like 4 hours. My teenage years weren't the best but also not the worst. Just leaving my first and the final post here. And to anyone and everyone whose gonna come out of their teen years during these hard times I wish you all the best for the rest of your life ahead of you! Good luck!
