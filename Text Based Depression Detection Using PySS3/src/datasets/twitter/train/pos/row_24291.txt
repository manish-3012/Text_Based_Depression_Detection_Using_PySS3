I got an idea for anyone who is looking to come out as gay, bi, etc. Ok so you take a Whereâ€™s Waldo book and replace Waldo to whatever you are coming out as. Then get a picture of yourself in a Waldo outfit and replace Waldo in the book. Another way you can do it is by taking a picture of a crowd with you in a Waldo outfit and placing it in the book.

I thought this was a funny way to do it and if anyone actually uses this method feel free to message me saying how it went.
