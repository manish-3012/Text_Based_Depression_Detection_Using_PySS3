I feel like a complete fucking failure. I was doing better with my paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions. I was okay enough to reach out to some old friends I had to cut contact with for mental health reasons.




It's been maybe three weeks since I started talking to them and already it's become too fucking much. I had to cut them off again. I can't even hold simple relationships due to my paranoia and delusions, it's just too fucking much. I can't stay in contact with people when I feel like they're constantly monitoring me through everything, and that they're all plotting to fucking kill me.




I can hardly leave my room because my hallucinations have kicked up intensity in the past week or so, so I just sit in the dark and hardly do anything. I can't get a fucking job because I can't leave the house without fear that someone's gonna kill me, I just feel like a complete failure. I've hid it from my mom that I've been suicidal for months, I've attempted suicide and I'm contemplating it again. I can't imagine things getting better, I don't see any way to beat this.





I'm almost at my fucking wits end. I don't really even know why I'm ranting about this here, I just needed to get it off my chest I guess.
