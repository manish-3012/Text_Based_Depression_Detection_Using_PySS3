Idk what the point of living is I have felt like this for a long time.  Nobody has ever shown interest in me and I only have like two close friends.  I suffer from anxiety and stress issues and it seems like too much.  I play two instruments seriously and itâ€™s piling up.  I go to a very competitive school academaicllt and I canâ€™t deal with it anymore.  This is the only place that I feel I can express all this so thanks pls help me and does anybody have experience with situations like this and if so how did you deal with the stress?
