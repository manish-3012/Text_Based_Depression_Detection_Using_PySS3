Searching for a minecraft player by the name of granularclaw512 So lemme give you some context.

I play a LOT of hypixel (minecraft server), due to it being the main server me and my friends play.
A couple minutes ago someone I killed in skywars requested to be in a party, so I accepted out of curiosity. He all of a sudden starts getting mad at me for apparently unfairly killing him a few matches back. I didnâ€™t really have time to talk and explain myself, due to him kicking me out of the party almost immediately after.

Granular, if your out there, I wanna duel you. Fair 1v1 to see whoâ€™s better. Iâ€™ll gladly accept defeat but I just wanna clear my name.

If you do see this, itâ€™s EmperorLime. 

(Also yes I did try messaging him no luck)
