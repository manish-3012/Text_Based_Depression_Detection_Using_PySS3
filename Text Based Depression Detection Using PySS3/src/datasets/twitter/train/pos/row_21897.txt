THE COPS PULLED US OVER (For a good reason tho) So i was with my friend walking in the busy street and we crossed the road without waiting for the street to calm down. A cop was right there in his car and pulled us over and just basically told us how ppl are getting killed out here and we need to be careful. I kept saying "im so sorry" bc i was so nervous and thought it was "embarrassing" but what happens in the street, stays in the street because my parents will not be knowing about this. Hopefully the cops dont work at my dads school tho and tell him about how he pulled over two black girls. The friend had left her house bc abusive shit was going on but this experience was a 7/10 and i will be doing this again. 

But i gotta get my friend to start being more respectful in the streets bc i dont want cops getting us againðŸ˜­
