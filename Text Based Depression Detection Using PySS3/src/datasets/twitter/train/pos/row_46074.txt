Update on my last post about my date We've been on four dates now and we hold hands and hug and stuff. But I havent seen him in two weeks cuz I got the rona. But we are making plans and as soon as my quarantine is up we are gonna go to like a haunted house or something and he completely supports me with everything and I'm just so happy I could cry
