Fucking society (I have to put this extra in to meet the word requirement) Fuck me my life could be better but itâ€™s me holding it back. I could be doing so much more but I just canâ€™t for some reason. Well I know what that reason is and itâ€™s a bitch to deal with, itâ€™s been curb stomping me sense spring. It was always there in the background but I never understood it until then. Fuck me dude, god really does hate me. Society is a bitch. Sorry for the long and cryptic post but I donâ€™t want to be one of those normies who just complains without putting any effort into it. 

Tldr: God hates me but I made it interesting
