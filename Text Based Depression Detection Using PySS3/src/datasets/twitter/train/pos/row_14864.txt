Teens who eat healthy and exercise, does that really affect their appearance? I have heard many times that eating healthy helps you look better but on the other hand I have a friend who looks damn perfect, without pimples and with a skin like porcelain and his diet is basically fast food and saturated fat, plus his only exercise is to lie on the bed to play playstation

and my other friend who is that typical healthy vegetarian white girl who works out constantly has skin like butter and lots of grains

Is it really useful aesthetically speaking to be healthy or is it only for your physical health?
