Some people can't mind their own business even in Zoom So I was there in a zoom class with all the other students. We had this huge meeting with all the students.

Then this one student decides "Oh I'm just going to call out all the other students if they're not paying attention" and proceeds to periodically unmute himself and literally SHOUT (like earape levels of shouting) out the names of the people not listening even if it was for a second. It happens a few times until the teachers got so pissed off at him and told him he was being disrespectful. He said sorry and said his OCD was making him do it. Now you might think that he would knock it off, BUT he started doing it again but in chat this time. My friend and I were messaging each other about it since it was hilarious and due to the way my camera was angled in a way that you could see my hands type, he called me out for "playing games" and told me to listen to the class. I was literally listening to class 99% of the time, but no, this clown wanted justice for the class and it was up to him to make that happen. Don't be like this guy or if you are, at least do it respectfully and PM the teacher or even wait after class, instead of shouting names in front of the entire class.
