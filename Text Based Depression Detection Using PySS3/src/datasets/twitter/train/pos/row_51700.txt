I feel like my life is slipping away So many of the things that used to keep me going arenâ€™t helping me. My hobbies are boring to me. Iâ€™m unmotivated in everything I do. I donâ€™t wake up with the drive to go â€œYeah! Iâ€™m going to get some work done!â€. Even when I hang out with friends, which has always been the biggest escape for me, i donâ€™t feel happy. Iâ€™ve never felt as isolated from my family as I do now. I canâ€™t even talk to my dad anymore, and Iâ€™ve just removed myself from my siblings. Iâ€™ve always felt a little mellow in the past but this is really exhausting me. The only thing I feel like I enjoy anymore is sleeping because I donâ€™t have to think while Iâ€™m sleeping. I canâ€™t escape from the voice in my head when Iâ€™m awake. And I want to believe that the voice is wrong, and that I do matter and people do love me and that I am better off being here.  But I sure donâ€™t feel like that. Iâ€™m self centered, whiny, emotionally unstable, maybe even manipulative. Iâ€™m too scared to be in a relationship with a girl i like, because even if by some miracle she liked me back, I know I would ruin her. Somehow. I ruin relationships. Honestly i just want to be hugged all night
