My day is ruined and it's all thanks to my big-ass feet. So my parents took me out today to get me some shoes, (ya know for school). And what a shitshow it was. We went to like, 5 different shoe outlets and not one shoe was large enough. My school requires purely white shoes and no brand marks (Idk they prob think it'll insult those who can't afford them). Where I live, size 12-13 feet is extremely extremely rare and it makes me feel abnormal as compared to other kids. For fuck's sake even my dad has smaller feet than me.
