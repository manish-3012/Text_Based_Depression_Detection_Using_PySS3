The finals are surprising.. not hard/nor pressuring I made a post on this sub a week or two ago about the finals coming up and how they're gonna be hard but in all reality.. they're really not, even though I didn't do the study guides, worksheets, or anything. (I just payed attention during the classes.. most of the time). The only test i'm struggling on is the ELA test which is just writing a essay about a story I didn't even bother to read or pay attention to as ELA *is boring* (at least to me)
