Iâ€™m a socialist who at one point had a crush on someone I knew at the time was a trump supporter I still donâ€™t hate her, we just donâ€™t use Republican as an insult or talk about politics when sheâ€™s around, we only talk about politics when weâ€™re alone which hasnâ€™t happened in like 4 years cuz the only thing thereâ€™s to talk about when itâ€™s just us is politics which goes nowhere and makes both of us angry, and I think she hates me now, that could have something to do with the fact rumors were spreading cuz I told one person who I told to not tell anyone who told a very loud person and it just kinda spread 

I kinda want to see what her opinion of the insurrection was cuz than Iâ€™ll know weather I hate or not, if she disapproves of that than we all relatively good, I mean sheâ€™s still xenophobic. Also I actually kinda know things now and I could point out that it could take 60 years to get a fucking green card
