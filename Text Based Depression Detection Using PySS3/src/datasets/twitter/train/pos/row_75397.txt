back for another rant :) I'll be writing as if I'm talking to the person, because I can't really explain it any other way. 

I'm sorry I couldn't be feminine enough. That I hate dresses, talking about boys, and going shopping. But it's not fair. It's not fair that I can't be who I truly am. I'm sorry you can't run your hands through my hair or compliment me on my makeup or dresses anymore. I just want to be your son. I can see that you won't accept me, and I don't blame you. 

I'm so, so, sorry I can't be your beautiful little girl anymore.
