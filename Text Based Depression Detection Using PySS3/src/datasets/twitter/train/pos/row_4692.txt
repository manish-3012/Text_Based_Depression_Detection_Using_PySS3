The annoying girl in my one class So there's this absolute annoyance in this class I take on cooking and stuff. Like, she's the stereotypical "stuck up popular girl", talks with the obnoxious accent, wears too much makeup, cant shut up about gossipy shit, etc. So in this class we are all in groups of 4, so it's me, that girl, her friend, and this other girl who's actually really chill. The annoyances of this pest are: -Saying I "seem like the kind of person who's friends with their mom" after I said how me and my mom went to a cool international market. -telling me to stop talking a lot while I'm talking about some of my weird interests(like learning c++), usually to the chill girl. And when I mention how her and her friend go on and on about whatever all the time too, she goes "well we talk about actual stuff". Girl you bitch about people not snapping you. -going on about how awful the school bus is and how she never will go on it once she has her license. Not horribly bad just in context feels crazy snobby.  -When getting food we just made, always asks others to get it for her instead of using her own damn legs.
