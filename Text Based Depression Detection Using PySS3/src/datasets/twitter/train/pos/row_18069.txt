Yknow when you make a joke and someone takes you seriously? So with Pier One going out of business, my mom has been buying their rugs and selling them for a $100 mark up on eBay and has made a crap ton of money. I joked saying she should give that money to me and she literally said she was willing to make a deal with me pending what I wanted 

Like wait this was a joke idk what I would spend with that money but a new amp and guitar and a bunch of shit would be cool but ahhhh
