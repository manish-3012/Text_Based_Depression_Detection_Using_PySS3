Spider Man 1 Occasionally, I go to the Salvation Army because why not? There's a section with stuff like picture frames, mugs, books, and movies. 

Every time I go to the movie section, I see at least two copies of Spider Man 1. Every fucking time. How many people have owned this movie? Until about a week ago, I'd never watched it. About two weeks ago, I went to the Salvation Army again. 

I waltzed on over to the movie section to find a copy of Spider Man 1 because I decided I wanted to watch it. Low and behold, this time there's like five copies.

I go home, and a week later, I force my family to watch it with me. 

What an experience, my friends.

That was probably one of the most fun times I had watching a movie. 

The movie it's self was fine, but there were so many weird things that made me laugh.

1. Everyone called Aunt May 'Aunt May'. Even Norman Fricking Osborne
2. The opening credits were like five minutes so it took a while to actually start the movie
3. [This](https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1237181844275240971)
4. Harry broke bro code and took MJ for himself
5. Norman Osborne loves Peter more than his own son to the point where he says he was surprised Harry graduated, and then talked to Peter about a science award and how very smart he was
6. Peter was kind of a creep. He kept following MJ legit everywhere
7. MJ didn't recognize that Mr. Spidey and Peter Parker weren't the same guy based on his voice, but potentially from a kiss or whatever I haven't watched the second one yet.
8. The webs came straight out of his wrists instead of a little contraption so I called it 'wrist piss'.

All in all a 10/10 experience but probably a 6 or 7/10 as an actual movie because my standards are pretty low, coming from someone who watches 2000s Disney movies that aren't High School Musical and Camp Rock for fun
