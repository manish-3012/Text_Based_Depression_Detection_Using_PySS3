Should I try again? So today I asked my crush for her number, and, well, she sort of laughed it off because she thought I was joking, (just to clarify I'm the type to jokingly flirt with people), and I didn't really want to make it akward by saying "I'm serious" or something like that, so I just kinda went with it, should I try again on Monday or just forget about it?
