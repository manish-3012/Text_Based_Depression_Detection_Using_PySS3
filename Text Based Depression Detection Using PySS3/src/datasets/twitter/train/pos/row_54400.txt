Please realize what your parents have done for you and cherish your memories and relationship with your family. As someone who has abusive parents, it always makes me both happy, and a bit jealous whenever I see a friend's parents having a healthy relationship with their kids. Both my parents are mentally abusive  and it's really hard to find a reason to live if you are seen as nothing but a disappointment and you really wish you just didn't wake up the next morning. So for all of you out there who have loving parents, I'm so happy for you and salute your parents. For those of you out there who struggle with your family, know that you're not alone and we share our pain.
