Mind Over Matter? Ok so, I never talked to anyone about this besides my sister. A few months back, I was playing Minecraft and I was in the process in defeating the Ender dragon. In the past, I've easily defeated the Ender dragon, but honestly I was struggling that night. Now I understand why some say Minecraft bedrock has a lot of bugs. Anyway, as I'm getting killed over and over by the Ender dragon I keep telling myself that I got this and I didn't give up until that dragon was dead. My mind was determined, so determined in fact that when I looked at my Arizona fruit juice can, it moved towards me. After that, I kept playing and eventually beat the Ender dragon. I took my potatoes and sausage and Arizona and went upstairs to eat. For a moment, I thought if I should drink the juice or not, because some other force may have messed with it. I drank it. I still can't explain it to this day. I'm not crazy. I saw it with my own eyes. Anyone able to explain it? Telekinesis or a unknown force?
