My Horrible PE Teacher For the past 1 and a half years I had a horrible PE teacher, Iâ€™ll just call him ARI. For the first 2 weeks of school he was great, let us play games have fun, etc. After that he started over exerting us. Every class he would move out water bottles farther away so we could never reach them for the 30 seconds he gave us to drink water per class. A girl almost fainted only and he didnâ€™t let her go to the nurseâ€™s office until another teacher argued with him that she could be in a serious condition. 

I still have him during quarantine, and due to a school rule, I canâ€™t just turn off my camera and ignore him. Other teacherâ€™s HATE him but since heâ€™s worked at the school for over 10 years, he canâ€™t be fired. I have a very low energy and too much exercise makes me puke. I once puked during class and he told me I was faking it and almost sent me to the principalâ€™s office for puking on his shoe. 

Does anyone have any clue of what I can do? Itâ€™s becoming a heavy toll mentally and physically on all of my classmates and I.
