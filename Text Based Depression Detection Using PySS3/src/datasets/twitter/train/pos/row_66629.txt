I posted here earlier about me continuing to screw up relationships and I think I figured it out Hope you guys can learn from my mistakes :(
It took a lot of self reflection, but I really have a problem with validation. Like when you get with someone and they break up with you hella fast, it makes you feel invalidated and sad because damn I screwed up already, so in the next relationship you start moving faster because you wanna feel validated that you can make a relationship work with someone, but then they get disoriented from how fast your moving and probably break it off with you. Aaaaand repeat until you feel so invalidated about not being able to be loved that you start falling for people way too fast and drive them away. Dont make my mistake ðŸ˜”Im hurting and should have taken the time to heal instead of rushing into another relationship and getting hurt even more. Dont do what I did, youll jusy dig yourself into a deeper hole each time
