Iâ€™m (not so) lonely So earlier today I made a post about the girl I like and about how her dad died. So about an hour ago I went to the funeral and said â€œIâ€™m sorry for your loss.â€ I wish I wouldâ€™ve said something more elaborate. Seeing her cry made my heart shatter because A.) I like her and sheâ€™s really cute and B.) my dad always tells me about my Grandfather and how he died when my dad was a teenager. I always get sad when my dad brings up my grandfather and I canâ€™t imagine what sheâ€™s going through right now. Iâ€™ll message her in a days or weeks to check on her. Thanks for the previous advice and thanks for the future advice
