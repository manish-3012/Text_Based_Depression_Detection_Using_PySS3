Rethinking all my Friendships D= My friend. MF=Mutual Friend. R=Random and Friends Cousin
Alright. So I started middle school this year so Iâ€™m in 6th grade. We werenâ€™t in person for the first time until about a month ago. Over the year, I made a few friends In my classes but only one I actually spoke to out of school except for the girl I am talking to. He is in my home room but nothing else. It just so happened that he was mutual friends with my best friend from elementary school that Iâ€™m still tight with. Anyway, to get to the point, I found out his Xbox live and now him, our mutual friend and a few other people here and there, play 2K together. Tonight though was different. He added me to a face time call with one number I recognized as his cousin and two I had no clue about. So I join and my best friend isnâ€™t there to back me up like normal because he was playing a rocket league wager. When I join the two ransoms are like â€œwho is this kid D?â€ So D introduced me and they immediately started joking about my name and how I sound like a gay nerd bc of how I talk. I have a lisp and a small speech impediment that Iâ€™ve had from birth and I was in speech therapy and corrected most of it but itâ€™s still sometimes there. Other than that my voice is pretty deep for my age. (Sorry for straying off topic so much btw, I just think these things might be important to the situation) So I half laugh, just so I donâ€™t seem like an uptight crybaby. (Now for the rest of the story to make sense I have to lay a few more things out for context. All of the people except me on this call were biracial, me and my best friend are both white. I donâ€™t want to get controversial so Iâ€™m just going to say me and my best friend both support the person who ran against Biden but please donâ€™t criticize me for that, I donâ€™t want to be political. I have a MAGA sign type thing in the angle I was holding my phone on ft. I make honor role and I helped D out with math a few times in the past. Iâ€™m slightly overweight but Iâ€™ve been working out)So the jokes continue about me being gay and at this point I havenâ€™t even played a game yet. After the first one, D has also been â€œjokingâ€ about it. At this point Iâ€™m getting pissed and I tell them all to shut up. Then D says â€œJust because we are black and youâ€™re white, and youâ€™re good at math, doesnâ€™t mean that your cracker ass can command us like slaves.â€ I was star struck. All that was going through my head was how I had been nothing but nice and he basically called me a racist pig that like to see black people enslaved. Then they start saying things like â€œyea you support trump and that makes you racistâ€. Eventually one of them who was a little more chill told them to chill out and stop giving me a hard time. Then the other random said â€œI donâ€™t give a f*** he can burnâ€. They all died laughing. Then D says that Iâ€™m a fatass (Iâ€™m like less that 15 lbs overweight and Iâ€™ve worked off 20+ pounds in the past 3 months) and that I go around the school hallways handing out twinkies and whenever I eat one I think itâ€™s spicy. Then the one I thought was kind of chill said â€œHe prolly saysâ€™mmm this smacks, Lordy beâ€™â€ he made himself sound like he was a redneck (Iâ€™m from Kentucky) and I donâ€™t even know what he meant by the â€œLordy Beâ€. We were just about done with the first game now and I had missed all my shots because I was so mad. They then called me ass and said I would never get a girl and that I was a racist jerk. I had shot a few jokes back at the start( that I now realize were corny) like when they called me gay I said â€œYea youâ€™re mom would say otherwiseâ€. Anyway, they ended the whole thing with saying that if I were to die no one would miss me and I told them to fuck off, blocked all their numbers, reported them all on Xbox live for hate speech because thatâ€™s what I took it as and block them all on Xbox too. Now Iâ€™m fearing that more of my so called friends are like this and if I should just say screw it and never talk to any of them except the ones that Iâ€™ve known since kindergarten again. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m blowing the whole situation out of the water but what they said hurt and I couldnâ€™t believe someone could change on me like that. Any advice? I know Iâ€™m probably too young to be getting caught up in drama but it just happens. Thank you all for reading, have a good spring break.
