Guys help I dont know what's happening I usually don't like chocolate, and dont eat it (and sweet things)

But for a few days now I've been eating way more chocolate than usual, but way way more. Maybe equal to a chocolate bar a day if not more

And while playing games, I'll disassociate,  want to puke and not feel my limbs and they'll get very cold
