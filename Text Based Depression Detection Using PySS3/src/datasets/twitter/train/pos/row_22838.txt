I'm confobbled So recently I posted saying I'm transgender, and then I realised the problem. I still like girls so I don't know what my sexuality is, I could never sexually like boys considering the sheer amount of dick heads there are in the world, but still I do have a crush on a girl and I'm kinda getting used to thinking of myself as transgender and gay. Anyone have any light to shed on this situation of mine
(brw I have literally no hope of getting with my crush cause she is perfect and I am literally the least perfect person there is)
