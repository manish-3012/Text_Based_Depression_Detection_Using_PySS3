Flairing a post as Serious should automatically delete Wholesome and other irrelevant awards In some large subs Iâ€™ve noticed that awards like the Wholesome award and Made Me Smile are automatically deleted on certain posts. Is there any way the mods could automate that here? Iâ€™ve seen lots of serious posts that get spammed with irrelevant awards.
