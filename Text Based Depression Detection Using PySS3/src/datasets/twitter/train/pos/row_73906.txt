Online School is a load of bullshit Online School is a complete utter load of horseshit, and I stand by my word. My example, the 60-problem math assignment. So Iâ€™m in 8th grade, and taking Algebra 1. So I check my assignments at midnight before I go to bed, and I donâ€™t see this assignment, itâ€™s nowhere to be found. So I set my alarm to 8:15, as my first class is at 9am and I didnâ€™t think I had assignments. So I wake up at 8:15, check my assignments, and surprise! A new assignment that was due at EIGHT IN THE MORNING. Note, I didnâ€™t see this before, and I didnâ€™t know this. I check the assignment, itâ€™s a 60-problem assignment. Not even a test, just a normal assignment. Fuck this bullshit.
