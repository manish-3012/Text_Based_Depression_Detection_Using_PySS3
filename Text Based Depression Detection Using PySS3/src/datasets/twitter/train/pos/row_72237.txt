She said I was â€œdryðŸ›â€. Wtf does that mean Iâ€™m texting this girl I like and weâ€™re having fun, at least I thought we were. She said she doesnâ€™t know if she can joke around with me or not because Iâ€™m dry ðŸ›. It kinda struck me by surprise because I thought we were having a fun time. I mean yeah I can be a little formal over text but thatâ€™s just how I am. Iâ€™m shy outside too, but I can joke around. Idk, Iâ€™m probably overthinking this. I told my friend about it and they said I should try to be less formal and more joking and funny, and if I liked her, to be a little flirty too. But the thing is, I donâ€™t know how. Do you know how? Either way I interpreted her calling me dry as her calling me a dry texter, basics saying Iâ€™m kinda boring to talk to. Feels a little bad
