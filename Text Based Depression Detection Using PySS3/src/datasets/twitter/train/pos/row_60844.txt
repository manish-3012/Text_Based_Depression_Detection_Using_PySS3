I need a little help So for a while now, my friends have seemed to have forgot about me. I was feeling pretty bummed out by it, so I confronted one of them and they said that they didnâ€™t know that I felt that way and that they were going to include me. I was so happy of this that I made a post of it here. That was almost 2 and a half months ago, and I havenâ€™t gotten any word from them whatsoever. I have felt really sad about it since about a month or so ago and I needed to ask from one teenager to others, am I depressed? I feel like I am only happy when I am distracting myself with video games or something else, and when I am not doing something, I just feel sad. I donâ€™t want to be one of those people who just label themselves as depressed, but I also donâ€™t know if I am fine. I just want to get answers from this community because I have seen a lot of people struggling with depression, along with a lot of people being helped. Please just give me some honest answers, I need to know.
