My annyoing little sister brat So I was in my own bed but my little sister stayed at my bed for too long, I told her it's my bed and want her to get out from my bed but she keep refusing. I tried pushing her to her own bed then she started crying like crazy! 

She won't listen then my mom came in then my little sister keeps crying like a baby. She acts like it's her own bed and acting selfish. I tried to have her a warning to get out from my bed but she cries and refuses to get out from my own bed. I know she is older than me but this is very annyoing why does my little sister even exist?!

I gave her 5 minutes to stay in my bed, after 5 minutes I asked her to get out from my bed but she refused again. Then I started pushing her to her bed with my feet. She cried like a autistic brat. But eventually my mom and dad caught me then lectured me.

I feel like I want to kill my sister violently. Man I wish I didn't have a little sister.
