My brain f*cking hates me! So I had this dream last night where my crush came to me and asked me if I wanted a relationship with her. I said yes and gave her a cookie for some reason. Then we cuddled for like 30 minutes not even kissed or had intercourse we just cuddled. It felt so good just the feeling of someone loving you, then I was forced to clean gorilla sh\*t and I got a pet Rayquaza but that's not the point. The point is that my brain made me think that there was somebody who loved me. When I woke up I felt so miserable that I hated myself because I know that she will never love me like in that dream. My brain literally made me think there was somebody who loved just to laugh in my face when I woke up, what an a\*\*hole!

I hate myself.
