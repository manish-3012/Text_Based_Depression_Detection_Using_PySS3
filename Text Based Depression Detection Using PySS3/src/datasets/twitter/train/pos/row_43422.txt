I was in a salt war So last year or this year i don't remember exactly, 
my friend gave me the idea to throw salt on our mutual friend i'll call him Daniela (caus he hates when i call him that)

 so i did, because i was bored and the next day he threw salt at me, and it went on for a while, 

until it became annoying for me becaused i had salt in my hair during class and i couldn't concentrate but then a Friday came and i wasn't happy that day, 

and my friend (not Daniela) was selling salt and sugar packs and i told them i wasn't in the mood and i was on the computer (in school) watching a movie because i didn't want to read the book, and i had a 3h lunch break, 

then Daniela bought a pack of suger AND THROW IT AT ME, 

i was so mad that i screemed cause salt is something and suger is something else, 

then continued to watch the movie and i may have shed a tear because i was having a bad day and i didn't speak to both of them for a week or two, 

but my friend (not danila) apologies for selling the suger and i forgave him and after a week i forgave daniela cause i realised i was over reacting, 

then i wanted to end the war so i wrote a treaty, i wrote it with a good hand writing, 

the only thing he had to do is pay me 1â‚¬ for all the damege he did to my hair and apologise and say that i won the war, 

when i showed him the treaty he took it and through it in the garbage and his argument was that he won and i had to pay him for a new bottle of shampoo that was 12â‚¬ because he used it all i didn't agree, 

at the end my friend (not Daniela) sorted things out and the wor ended and no one paid anyone money and no one won, 

the saying is tru thre are no winners in a war
