Listen im not religious but this was something else So today was not it yk, break up and shit didnt feel so good. Had to block her on everything so i didnt text her at like 3AM saying i missed her and shit, not a very good day to the say the least. So my friend invites me to go play basketball, and mind you he hasnt texted me in like 4 months, and im like sure. So i get out the house cuz i need some fresh air anyways, and if i stayed home i woulda just stayed there bawling my eyes lmao. So i get out, and he didnt specify where to meet up with him, but we usually go to the park so i get to the park and i get there early as we were supposed to meet at 2. 

Pretty much play ball by myself for like an hour as noone is at the courts, so im just shooting around and vibing to music. My mind is pretty much blank and shit and than at like 2 i text him saying where u at, and hes like "shit dude i meant we balling at my house" cuz like he has a hoop, no problem cuz he lives like 10 mins from the court. So on the way there and im like 3 minutes away, like 2 blocks and stuff and like this old man, wearing all black hands me this paper and its like about jesus and the bible, and yk normal things like that but what he said while handing me it is what like was crazy, he said " well i hope this makes you cheer up for what happened today" and it can very well be a huge coincidence, and thats what i think but man that was just mind blowing to me.  Low key made me feel better though.
