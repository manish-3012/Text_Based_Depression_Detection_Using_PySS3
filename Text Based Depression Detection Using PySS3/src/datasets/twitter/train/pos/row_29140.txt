The higher-ups of major news publications, like the Wall Street Journal, should be arrested. I know this belongs in r/WallStreeBets, but hear me out... As you all already know, many publications are discussing the drop in value of GME. While this is complete and utter rubbish and should not be listened to, they also make claims that silver is increasing in value, when in reality it followed a normal pattern of increase by only 2 dollars over the last week. This cannot continue, because although the Reddit community remains vigilent (I am proud of you my bretheren) and wants to continue focusing on the rise of GME and diminish the fake news spreading, many older investors on this platform or investors taking advice from their kids / grandkids may not know about the fact that silver is raising as high as they think.

This fake news also supports the bold claim of corrupt media, in that major publications like the Wall Street Journal (no surprise there) are receiving money from collapsing hedge funds in order to change the direction of the stock. I would like to make it clear to the older investors that: NO, silver is NOT going up, and that you should ALWAYS conduct your own market research to see what is the best product to invest in. The fake news spreaders should be arrested for falsifying information (although not directed at the government, it should still be taken into consideration) and be forced to give their bribes to the market or the public, individual investors.

Lastly, as an extension to the previous RobinHood posts, yes, I do believe that closing the open market should be a crime, and yes, I do believe that if it is already, then the CEO of RobinHood should be replaced or arrested.

These are just my thoughts, comment what you want down below and tell me what you think. After all, it is a discussion piece, right?
