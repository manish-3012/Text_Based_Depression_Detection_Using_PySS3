Hot take: If you vape/smoke/juul, youâ€™re an asshole You have this habit you created for yourself Iâ€™m sure you didnâ€™t think beyond yourself thatâ€™s just human but think for one second for those around you your filling others lungs with harmful vapors and smoke and literally tons of cancer causing chemicals but Iâ€™m sure you didnâ€™t think about how your actions affect others so how about you eh? How do you think your lungs like being constantly filled with cancerous vapors? Did you ever think why you coughed like a bitch for your first several hits? Itâ€™s because thatâ€™s so fucking unhealthy that for you that you wonâ€™t make it to an elderly stage of life why do you think all smokers are middle age? Why do you think you never see an elderly smoker? Just think about that for your sake and ours
