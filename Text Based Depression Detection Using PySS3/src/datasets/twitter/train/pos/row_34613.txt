I turned the Rick &amp; Morty high IQ copypasta into Family Guy To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Family Guy. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Brian Griffin's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Family Guy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Peter's existential catchphrase of anything misogynistic towards his wife, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as David A. Goodman's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Family Guy tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž
