join back a discord server to see all My friends hate me i had this online group of friends, we were all very close, I was close with this one guy, we had a really good friendship, but then I messed it all up cos talked too much about my self-harm and he got worried sick about me and he couldn't sleep, so he stopped talking to me. around 5 months later, I gave him a apolyge, and he said he forgave me. but , more throughout the months we all stopped talking,  I tried to reconnect with them, and well, I felt kinda left out  to them, things weren't the same. this one time I left the server for a joke, we where all joking, at least I thought. i asked one of them to inv me back, but he left me on read. then I got a inv from another friend who I am still good friends with, and when I joined, I saw them talking about how they hate me. i left shortly after I saw that.
