I had a dream about this girl I used to know that's got me in a mood In order to really understand this dream I'm gonna have to get explain some background information.

So a few years ago I used to know this girl who was a pretty good friend of mine. I never really liked her in a "crush" kind of way mostly because I didn't think she would like me. But I do know she liked me. My friend who also knew her pretty well told me that she said she really liked me. (This is the first time I've figured out a girl had a crush on me) So I remember being pretty stoked. This got me a little interested in her. (Now that I think about it I should have asked for her number but I'm a pretty reserved dude when it comes to things like that.) The year was coming to a close and I figured out I had to change school. This actually didn't bother me that much, even after figuring out about how much that girl liked me. After I changed school over the next few years I kinda forgot about her. But then the dream I had recently comes in.

Dream: I was at a new school I was moved to and I ended up having that girl in one of my classes. She instantly recognized me and I recognized her. We ended up catching up about a lot of things that have happened in our lives. It was one of the most amazing and fun conversations I've had. (Of course it was in a dream) She and I were having a great time and she was laughing a lot. She had a very distinct laugh that was extremely contagious. So hearing it was a very nice to hear after all this time. Then the bell rang and we had to go home. That's when I woke up.



Now I want to reach out to her and see what happened but I have no connection to her. This dream really got me in the feels and I just want to talk to her again.
