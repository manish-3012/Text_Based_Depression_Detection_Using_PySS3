Something I need to say Ive seen a lot of posts on this subreddit about how 'school is about grades not learning' or something similar, and I need to just point out that yeah maybe it is, but grades are a measure of how much you learn and the effort you put into learning, school is not that difficult and if you just put in effort like most teachers expect, then you will do just fine. There are a lot of problems with the school system (I live in the US so it might be better in other countries idk) Im not denying that but I dont think that the grading system is one of them, things like students being able to choose more profession specific classes should be talked about more, being able to see if you are interested in a certain field while in HS rather than having to spend even part of a collage tuition just to find out its not right for you. And yeah there are some teachers that are unreasonable, or not the best at teaching a subject, or just straight up should not be teachers but a majority of them are looking to help students learn but the students also have to be willing to learn and put in the effort to do so. Thats all I wanted to say, have a nice day.


TL;DR of this is basically stop complaining about school and just put in effort, its not that hard. There are other bigger issues with the school system.
