Not to flex but, today i (15m, gay) got a bj from a girl  today girl from my class came to my house so i can help her with homework. Nothing special at all. In school we didnt talk much. Before she arrived my parents werent arguing like they do every day so i was in a good mood.

I explained her math as we planned. That took about 1 hour. After we were done she suggested to watch some tv so we did. We found one movie and started watching it. I was sitting on the left side of my sofa, she sat on right side. 

As we were watching i got random boner like i do sometimes. I felt embarassed and tried to hide it. I was wearing shorts so its noticable. My brain was literally screaming *fuuuck.* She noticed something was wrong and i replied: everything is fine. But she saw what was going on. When she said "i can help you" i lost my breath.

1. she noticed my boner and i felt more embarassed than ever
2. She said she can help me??? She doesnt even know im gay

My horny brain replied: okay. So she came closer and you know what happened. When she left she smiled at me. 

*I know im gay. Girls dont attract me, they never did. I was just horny and dont know why i said okay. Kill me please*

Have a nice day/night
