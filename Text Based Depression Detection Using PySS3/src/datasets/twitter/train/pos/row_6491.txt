Should interns teach highschoolers? [serious] https://www.poll-maker.com/poll3169113xD60345f3-98
All through thought school I have had teachers that were still in college, not always seeking to become a teacher, teaching some of my classes which pertained to their major. 
So the 23 year old who wants to major in history teaching a bunch of highschoolers history
No teaching degree. 
Are there circumstances when college students teaching teens hightschool classes would be a good idea?
