When you're more mature than your own parents My parents constantly complain about me and how I'm such a "typical teenager"  and they mock me constantly, saying things like "oh no, I'm a teenager and life is soooo hard" and how I'm so lazy but man I just want a break. I've like three projects due and school started two weeks ago. I can't focus properly and I honestly need help but my parents just don't care. They claim I'm faking everything for drugs. They get mad at me for having online friends. They get mad at me for having irl friends. Then they turn around and yell at me because "i never tell them anything", like no I'm not gonna tell you anything if you're gonna yell at me. My dad is also homophobic and I'm fucking terrified of them going through my phone in case they find out I'm bi and trans. My dad says "i'm his property and he can touch me whenever he wants". Not in the creepy way but, if I'm upset or breaking down he makes a point of touching me and mocking me when I start crying and screaming at him to stop. Why am I terrified of my own parents? Nobody deserves to be terrified of their parents.
