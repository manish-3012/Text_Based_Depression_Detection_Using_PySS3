I think my friend did something shitty to me but I wanted to see if I'm overreacting so I figured coming here would be a good idea So recently my friend (19M) bullied Me (13M) into giving him my Whooky Sack and my beloved Mario Water that I've had since I was 7. This really annoyed me but I don't want to end a friendship over it so can I get some feedback?
