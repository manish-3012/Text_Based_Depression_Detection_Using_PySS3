I don't know what to do My dad is threatening to give up on me and give custody to my unemployed mom if I don't raise my self-esteem and beat my ADD (I don't take any medication for it), which only makes me feel shittier about myself and get more anxious and forgetful every day. I've been on this downward spiral for over two years and have considered suicide multiple times. I'm at the lowest point I've ever been and every time he yells at me to be better and stop doing bad "on purpose" just makes me feel worse. I feel lower than dirt right now and I don't know what to do. Worst part is, I'm not a bad kid in any sense of the word, I have straight A-s, never talk back, never get in trouble, nothing. It makes everything seem so unfair. That's it, I just wanted to get that out of my head.
