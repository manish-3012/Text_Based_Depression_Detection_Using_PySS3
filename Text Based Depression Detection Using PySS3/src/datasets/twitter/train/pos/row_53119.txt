I hate my life, I want to be a young teen again Hey guys, I am approaching the last 3 months of my teenage life and I am just about through with everything.  My parents made me get a place of my own once I graduated high school, so I took on a shitty service job which has me working over 60 hours a week, and I live in such a terrible state that the housing prices are so high I have to spend 80% of my paychecks on rent alone.  I just wanna be a kid again, I hate living in california, this state is hell on earth, where I now live the area is infested with rampant abusive homeless, drug abuse, widespread coronavirus, and a terrible job market.

My parents probably don't want me, I don't want to burden them, I am trying to make plans to find a new place to run away to but I have the problem of slowing saving up enough money in order to make it.  I just want to die sometimes, with coronavirus I feel I will lose my job any day too.
