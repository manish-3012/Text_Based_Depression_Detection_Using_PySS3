I became a victim of sextortion today This is gonna be a bit of a tougher topic for this subreddit but I need to talk about it. This is very embarrassing but I really need help. Today I became a victim of sextortion. Was was chatting on Omegle and things got a little steamy. We exchanged instagrams and talked a little on there and then we eventually went to call on Skype. Iâ€™m an idiom for not realizing it then. We then exchanged suggestive things in the video call and after she showed me a screen recording of myself nude and showed me screenshots of some of my followers from Facebook. She said she would send the screen recording to all my followers and upload it on YouTube unless I paid her 1000 dollars. I obviously didnâ€™t pay and tried reasoning with her for a minute before just locking her on everything we talked on. Itâ€™s a few hours later now and Iâ€™m more stress than Iâ€™ve been in years and I donâ€™t know what to do. I know itâ€™s illegal and I can go to the police but my main concern right now is my friends and family seeing that screen recording. I just really donâ€™t know what to do right now and I was wondering if anyone knows if this person will most likely or most likely not share the video. Ok very ashamed of what had happened and I just really could use some helpful words. Thank you all for all the help I love you all.
