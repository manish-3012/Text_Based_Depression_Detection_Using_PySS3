No BS Serious Question Texting is mad difficult for me. Using proper grammar is unusual, responding quickly sometimes makes u look desperate/clingy when in fact all im doing is responding to something I saw pop up on my screen. It's hard to convey in what tone some people are talking (emotion wise). Also sometimes certain things a person does can cause the other to make assumptions. Probably a whole lotta others things that go along with it. Im just asking how do yall deal with all that bs. In general texting makes my brain hurtðŸ¤¯.
