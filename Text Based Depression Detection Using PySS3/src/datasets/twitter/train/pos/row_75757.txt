Ik i marked as rant but i need help I have a lot of studies related problems as in im in ninth and in my first term I have failed in three subjects. My parents won't acknowledge the fact that I can't understand math and French and will continue to insist that im smart and not hardworking and im just lazy. They think that they know all about me yet they don't know shit. They think I lie because im lazy. I hate two things in life and those are organising and studying and those are the very things that are most required of me and it makes my life unbearable. I am going to have another examination in Feb and ill fail that too. I really can't study math and French. My school made me take French as my second language and my parents made me take math and said that if I didn't take math they won't let me take science. I couldn't have dropped science as it is my best subject and hence I had to take math. And now they constantly say that if I don't improve my grades then they will stop paying my school fees. In my country public school qualification is impossible for me now because of my second language. It's impossible for me to get a job if I don't pass college cause here there is a major over population problem. People of my age are getting overall averages of 97% and mine is around 50%. I really don't know what I will do if I fail tenth. Even for minimum wage you need to be twelfth pass. I am really going to fail my tenth exams idk what to do I get like 12/80 in math and 21/80 in French and history civics please help.
