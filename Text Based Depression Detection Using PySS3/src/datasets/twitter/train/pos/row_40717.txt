I wrote a poem thing Sweet Marianne
By SpagEddie8113

The lady from the countryside called Marianne,
Has eyes colored of embers and skin carâ€™mel tan,
She speaks with echos of the moon,
In her hands she bears her wooden spoon,
And hair beautiful as her golden speckled fan.

The flowers grow around her in fields of red pinks.
She doesnâ€™t seem to notice, for of lights she thinks.
Her wooden colored arms stretch out,
Of memories sheâ€™ll kindly tout,
Marianne is lovely, down to the way she blinks. 

She acts as Goddess of the shining orange trees,
She calmly sits beside it, her hands hold her knees,
The fruit floats up into the night,
But Marrianeâ€™s the truest sight,
Softy smiles peacefulness into honey bees.

She lives off of grass and is fed with honey stars,
Speaking in a whisper with her voice of sitars,
Slowly she steps up heavenâ€™s stairs,
She captures what galaxy bears,  
Marianne sits back down and strums at the guitar.
