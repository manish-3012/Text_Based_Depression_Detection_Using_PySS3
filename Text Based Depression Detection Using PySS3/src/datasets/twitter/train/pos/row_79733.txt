Can somebody help me pick the right size hoodie for my bf? hiya! iâ€™m looking to buy my bf a hoodie (but i want it to be a surprise and so i donâ€™t want to ask him!) heâ€™s like right on the edge of 5â€™11 to 6â€™0 and heâ€™s super skinny like ~ 60kg, iâ€™m in the UK and was on boohoo and the special tool told me heâ€™d be a size small but any small adjustment and it put him into a medium, iâ€™m worried if i get a small itâ€™ll be too short because of the height but a medium would just be too baggy? if anyone could somehow tell me if theyâ€™re his size and could help please !!! ty so much x
