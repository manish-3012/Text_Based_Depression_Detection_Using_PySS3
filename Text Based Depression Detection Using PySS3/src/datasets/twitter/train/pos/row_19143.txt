I hate â€œmy crush likes me backâ€ posts theyâ€™re so unoriginal, and most of the time theyâ€™re fake. somehow people always get them to the top and even waste money giving them animated emojis, when literally all they say is â€œi told my crush how i feel and they feel the sameâ€.
anyway thanks for listening to my ted talk imma head out
