Making Diavolo deaths everyday until stone ocean gets animated #1 Diavolo gets beaten by DIO instead of Giorno in 1v1 scenario. Tge only reason DIO would win would be because Epitaph wouldn't be able to see stopped time. I could see this kinda playing out like Jotaro vs DIO. Where Diavolo has the upper hand but then DIO reveals his stand ability and fucks Diavolo in the ass.

Ok what ideas do you have for the next death?
