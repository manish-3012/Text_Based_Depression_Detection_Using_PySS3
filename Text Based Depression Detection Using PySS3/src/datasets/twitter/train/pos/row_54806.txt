me and my friends stripped the mannequins at pacsun this was like , in january , n we were at the mall . soo we went into pacsun , and my friend wanted this rib shirt or something (idk tf) and there was nothing in her size. so she looked at a mannequin , that was xs , and she tried to remove the shirt , which was rly hard , considering that the mannequin had her hand on her hip . so we all tried to remove it , and in the end we did :D 

idk why , but we started laughing , and we all started removing shirts from all the mannequins . everybody else started looking at us , and that made us laugh more . the thing was , all of these mannequins were in poses , so it was rly hard . but we managed to strip at LEAST 9 mannequins .

and well we ran out ðŸ˜

apologies to the workers at pacsun-
