Why do "super straight" people think they're special Why does it even need a new label anyways? Why can't we just have Trans-open straight people and Trans-closed straight people? It'd just be like "TO or TC straight" and that would make it less like a bragging point with the "super" part. In fact, calling it "super" straight is just egotistical in itself. I don't care if you're straight or not; just don't make it a big deal for literally no reason. Straight people have never been oppressed. There's no justifiable reason for a movement like this; the only sensible one is that y'all want attention. I'm gonna be done with Reddit for a while until this blows over.
