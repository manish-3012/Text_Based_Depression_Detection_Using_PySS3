I just need a hug It's my birthday tomorrow and most probably no one will remember it. So i'm just going to sit here and wish you well  (Having an extremely sad life is no excuse to make someone else feel bad). So how are you? Do you need water? but are too lazy to go downstairs, here-ðŸ¥› (i got you milk instead)
