I'm not sure why people feel bad about getting raped and i feel bad about it. I've just never been able to understand exactly why people feel bad about getting raped. I know that it's a bad thing of course, but i don't know exactly why. I *want* to know, so i don't feel out of place with all of the other survivors like me, but i don't understand.

I really hope i'm not a bad person for asking this question, but i'm curious.
