How bad is it to be a kissless virgin as college sophmore I mean i do have one kiss but i do not count it because I was drunk and the girl was unattractive

Also yeah Ik everyone move their own pace its not  race yadda yadda, i mean from the perspective of the normal average person (note I said average, not average user on this sub) how weird is it does it make me a loser. Im physically attractive and socially competent (except with romance obviously since I had no experience) i just dont really have any motivation to pursue girls even when theyre into me. I never make the first move either so the only experience i even have is all from the girl iniating things cuz Idk how do that. Am i just weird and a loser
