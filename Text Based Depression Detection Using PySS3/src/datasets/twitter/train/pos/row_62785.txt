I think i probably donâ€™t have a bright future. You know, its not gonna happen... a lovely family with a beautiful woman and enough wealth to be happy, its simply too good to be true, i mean i am simply not loveable or someone whoâ€™s gonna be wealthy at all...i will screw everything up because i have way more responsibilities in the future and I already canâ€™t do my shit correctly.

Ima fucking take a bath with a toaster in the future or something, I donâ€™t like therapists or anything
