is it a compliment to get called adorable by a girl younger than me? so I'm a 17 year old dude and I'm very young looking (i maybe look 14-15) and this girl 16 called me adorable. is this a compliment? i feel like it's kinda of back handed like she's saying I'm cute like a baby is. am i over thinking this? thank you
