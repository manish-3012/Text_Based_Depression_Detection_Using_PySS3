Am I the only one that doesnâ€™t have a problem with online school My school is in person now, which Iâ€™m happy about, but like online school was not that bad. Iâ€™m a straight a student and stayed that way during online. To me it seems like people just love to blame schools for their own laziness. Maybe it just suits my learning styles better. Anyone else?
