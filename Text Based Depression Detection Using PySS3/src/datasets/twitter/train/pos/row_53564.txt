Turning 20 tomorrow So I guess today's the last day I can post here. Just remember it doesn't last forever. It feels like just yesterday it was 2013 and I had just turned 13. Just try to have fun, whatever that means for you. You may well look back someday and be sad if you didn't. If you plan on going to college, it matters where you go but not half as much as you'd think. Your world isn't over if you don't get into your top choice school. It's also not the end of the world if your crush doesn't like you back or you're not the most popular person at school. Even two years after high school that stuff barely matters. Try to be nice to your family since before you know it you'll be on your own. That's the bottom line.
