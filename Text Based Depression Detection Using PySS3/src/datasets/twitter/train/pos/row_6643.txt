Mom doesnâ€™t let me buy a headset, even tho she lets my brother buy his thing Alright, so Iâ€™m a VR fanatic. (By that I mean Iâ€™ve owned 6 or 7 headsets) you could imagine how fucking exited I was when I heard that the â€œOculus Quest 2â€ launched! I asked my mom if I could get it if I sold another headset. She said yes. I sold my Oculus rift Cv1 so I could buy my sweet sweet quest 2. Then we get to the store, I have the last box in my hand, and she says no. I say why, she respond with â€œitâ€™s just too expensive hunnyâ€. From me being a teen with a job (1400 plus in the bank) She reasonably should have let me buy the headset. Now my entire life Iâ€™ve felt like the least important kid. Still do. When my older brother sells his Nintendo switch, so he can buy a â€œNew exclusive limited editionâ€ version for 300. He sells his old switch for 225. And mom allows him to buy his new switch. The Headset I want to buy costs, guess. 300. I sell my headset for 300 FUCKING DOLLARS, and she doesnâ€™t let me buy it. I have more money in the bank than him as well. He only has a better gpa than me. Iâ€™m a better gamer, athlete and human, and she rejects me. Sorry, had to vent.

TL;DR:
I sold a Vr for 300 to buy a 300 dollar be and mom doesnâ€™t let me buy it. My brother sells his switch for 225 and buys a 300 dollar switch, and she lets him. Unfair.
