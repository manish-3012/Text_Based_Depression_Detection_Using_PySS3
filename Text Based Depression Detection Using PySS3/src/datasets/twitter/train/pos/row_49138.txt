Some of yâ€™all really need to care about world issues more I never post on this sub, and only occasionally go, but I came here to see the reactions to RBGâ€™s death. Itâ€™s sickening how many people didnâ€™t know who she even was.

This is a common theme both on this sub and off. Too often, teenagers donâ€™t care about important issues. You donâ€™t care about the protests about racial equality and police brutality, you donâ€™t care about gun control, you donâ€™t care about any political issue because â€œIt doesnâ€™t affect youâ€ or â€œI donâ€™t want to know about politicsâ€. Too bad, itâ€™s your responsibility to be informed about the world that you will soon join. It costs you nothing to care, and contrary to what you likely believe, it can affect you, and people our age can actually make a difference

â€œToo ignore evil is to become accomplice to itâ€
