Do you ever have a super un-nerving dream.  In that stage before any of the other stages, just as you had lost consciousness and it's not anything specific, but it's like a white noise youve never heard before with no specific picture to it and you are aware your body is shuddering and then you aware you are in a dream and you can't escape and then you are awake... You feel full body pins and needles for a few seconds fading. Now you wanna pull and all nighter because you are scared so you start the night by posting it on reddit. 6 hours to go.
