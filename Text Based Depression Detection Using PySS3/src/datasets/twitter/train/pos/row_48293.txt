I havent been truthful with my girlfriend lately and she is mad at me because I havent told her why I'm acting differently and she is mad at me This morning I texted her this : I feel useless right now iâ€™m losing sleep i miss you i miss going into school and seeing my friends and teachers and iâ€™m going mentally insane at home because iâ€™m bored all the time and iâ€™ve lost interest in a lot of the things i do like watch movies want to go out skateboarding play video games and see friends. The past couple weeks iâ€™ve felt like im useless and iâ€™ve had thoughts about suicide a couple of times and i didnt want to tell you because i didnt want you to worry or think of me as being mentally insane and i want to be with you til i can say to my kids that iâ€™ve only dated one women and thats your mom. Also thats why i have been asking you the if you found out that i am depressed or i am thinking about commiting suicide questions. Donâ€™t blame this on you because you didn't cause any of it. It's been other things that have been affecting it like not seeing my friends, not being in school, and the past couple of nights I've cried a bit thinking about it and I don't cry about stuff and things like that. Iâ€™m sorry that I haven't been truthful with you. I know we said that we werenâ€™t going to lie about things and I'm sorry I've done wrong and I lied to you. I hope you can accept this as my apology and donâ€™t blame anything on you because you didnâ€™t cause any of any of it. I am terribly sorry about it all. I still want to date you and I want to have a committed relationship with you and hold you in my arms and sit on a bench on the boardwalk and lay my head on your shoulder and listen to your interest and listen to your stories and dreams to me. 

She hasn't gotten back to me. Should I try calling her but I dont want to seem to annoying.
