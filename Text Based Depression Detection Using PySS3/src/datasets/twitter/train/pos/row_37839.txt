I just messed up my test. I just got the results for my test, and it's really fucked. It's not the end of the world, but it's not enough for me to achieve what I've been dreaming.

For context, I live in South Korea. Here, if you don't already know our country is notorious for its overall education system and the social norm of "not being able to succeed unless you go to a good university". 

And I just really fucked up my test. And I just lost confidence in what I'm doing overall because of it. I want to become an astrophysicist or an aerospace engineer, and for that I need to have good scorings on Maths and Science. Science is fine, but Maths is really difficult for me. The only satisfying results I got was English (I'm the best in the school) and Science, and the others are just meh. (We have 6 subjects tested: Korean, English, Maths, Science, Social Studies and Korean History)

What's even more frustrating is that the people around me tell me 

"You are so intelligent, but why can't you get Grade 1(the highest 96th percentile, equivalent to the top 9 students; high schools in SK measure students' assessment records by how well you do compared to other students) ?"

The talk they give me is kinda motivating, but at the same time really undermining because every time I take a test, it's always the so-so level. Can you fellow redditors provide me with advice?

TL;DR : Living in South Korea, tests matter a lot and I just fucked up the test. Please, I need all the help I can get.
