My Friends found my Reddit account I (For some reason) linked my Reddit account to my Discord, and one of my friends found out and ~~stalked me~~ looked through everything I posted, commented, ect. Then he told someone else and knowing that they can see what I post honestly scares me a little bit.

And that being said Jake or Oliver, if you're reading this, please kindly fuck off
