I am conflicted So there's this girl from my school who started texting me recently. We got to talking and now we talk and hang out on a regular basis. She also admitted to having a huge crush on me in 7th grade. 

We live in the same neighborhood, have the same classes, are going to the same highschool next year, we have the same taste in music, the same interests and hobbies, the same general values and I relate to her like I never have to anyone else. 

Based on the things she sends me and the way she talks to me, I am 99% certain she still has feelings for me, but I don't know how I feel about her. I'm really confused if I wanna start a relationship right now or stay friends, and honestly I'm kinda scared. I haven't had school since march 2020 so I haven't been socializing with people and girls very much, so my social skills and confidence kinda went down in the shitter. I just don't really know what to do here. Do I take action or let things be how they are?
