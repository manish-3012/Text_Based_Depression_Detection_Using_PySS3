bro i fucking hate my country country: turkey

first off has a government that only cares about money and their members and is screwing up the economy and basically everything inside, literally there are no good things here except for maybe the food

education is also trash, forces religion classes after the current party was elected and it thankfully it leads to secular people emerging instead of extreme Islamists 

third is the economy, the currency literally fell from exchanges of USD 1=5 to nearly USD 1=8 and that has made a fuck ton of items like Playstations "luxury" when they should just be a common item, plus VAT taxes are high as fuck which makes stuff like cars get 4x more expensive. also, the minimum wage hasn't gone up for 2 years which lowered people's purchasing power, literally their wages in USD full from like 500 dollars to 350 dollars, and with the shitty VAT taxes, it makes life EXTREMELY hard if you're on minimum wage. oh, and also you cant get decent pay here. literally, if you're a good engineer you'd be paid like 1000 dollars on average whereas in the US it's more of 4000 dollars, and also the more east you go the less developed it gets and the more terrorist attacks there are.

fourth is the people. the people are pretty decent here but online a lot of them are 9-year-old nationalist bigot assholes who make everyone seem like scums due to their numbers. also, people literally ignore laws, people here jaywalk with no consequences, and also there is a high amount of tax evasion and I've heard tax evasion is around 6.7%

fifth is the laws. for example, I'm gonna give you drone laws, so you need to register drones if they're over 500 grams (better than most other nations) but you also need a permit and license for some drone shit which in a country like Canada you only need a license. also, you can get penalties of upwards to 11k TRY (nearly 1500 dollars) if you don't do something right
