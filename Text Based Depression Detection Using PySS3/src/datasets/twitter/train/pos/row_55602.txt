I cannot catch a break romantically bro. Honestly, itâ€™s kind of hilarious, itâ€™s just very ironic No, itâ€™s not that Iâ€™ve been in terrible relationships or what not. Itâ€™s exactly the opposite. Iâ€™ve never had one

Itâ€™s funny because Iâ€™m not one of those dudes thinking every act of kindness is romance. I go off hard evidence, what I heard people said about me, or what I see in person. And Iâ€™m not unattractive. Girls like me, objectively. 

Legit. You can see the butterflies, itâ€™s obvious as fuck. Hair twirl, nervous smiles, getting touchy texting me, Iâ€™ve seen it all. 

But since Iâ€™m not in anyoneâ€™s social group, well, I get plenty of flirting, nothing of substance. No date, no sex, no girlfriend. It never goes past step 1.

And my luck is atrocious. When I try, they have a bf. Then they get single and I didnâ€™t know. Then I try again, and well, yeah.  My female friends donâ€™t get how Iâ€™m single 

So yeah, itâ€™s nothing to be dramatic about. 15 year old me would be so sad, but at this point I just need 10 mins of sad music to get over a rejection.

But it really hits hard. Like damn, I canâ€™t imagine what Iâ€™d do if I wasnâ€™t confident in myself deep down. 

Maybe itâ€™ll all turn around in college, who knows. I do know, when I go to college, no more heart on my sleeve. Itâ€™s no good, seriously. You just get played with, but you donâ€™t actually get something

So yeah. Iâ€™m confident, chill, not too volatile, and I try a decent amount. Iâ€™ve truly been gatekeeped out of romance by bad luck.
