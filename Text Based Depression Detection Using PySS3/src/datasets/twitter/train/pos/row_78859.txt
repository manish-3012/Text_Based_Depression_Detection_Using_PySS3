Fuck this shit I just got downvoted for saying something slightly negative about star trek discovery on r/startrek. 

And they said it was gatekeeping because I was criticizing something wtf. 

And I clearly stated multiple times that I respect discovery fans because it's just a matter of personal taste, and it's just that discovery isn't my cup of tea.

I fucking hate this aspect of reddit. The major big subreddits are really bad. I hate getting downvoted for saying a slightly different opinion.
