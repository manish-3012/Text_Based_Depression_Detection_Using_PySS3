Flirted with my (now) boyfriend for a whole 4 months before he got the hint It was so obvious. Even some of his friends asked me if I liked him but I asked them not to tell him. 4 months. And apparently he had no idea but he liked me back and he thought I was just being friendly when I said he was my favorite person to talk to and when I called him cute apparently he thought I was just joking. Why are men so clueless omg. Either way I love him and he's adorable. Jeremiah if you're reading this even though it took an entire four months of dropping obvious hints, it was entirely worth itâ¤ï¸
