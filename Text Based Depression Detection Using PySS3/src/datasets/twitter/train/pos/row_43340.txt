I hate ppl that fake depression Thereâ€™s the ppl that are actually depressed and actually think theyâ€™re horrible and actually mean it when they scold themselves but because thereâ€™s so many idiots that though HeY tHeY gEt A lOt Of CoMpLiMeNtS sO LeTs dO tHe SaMe everyone will think ur faking it, or at least donâ€™t know, like fr if ur not depressed donâ€™t act like it for attention, also if something happened and ur just sad, ur not depressed, thatâ€™s a mental thing that u either have or donâ€™t, and u donâ€™t get it from being sad, I know that probably nobody whoâ€™s reading this does this itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m sick of the ppl that do and I guess Reddit is just kind of a good vent sometimes :p
