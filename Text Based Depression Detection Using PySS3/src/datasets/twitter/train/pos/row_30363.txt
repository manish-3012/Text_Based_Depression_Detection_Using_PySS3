What's the most rebellious, illegal and stupid thing you've ever done as a teenager? Fake tickets (I print my country's tickets, not dollars), look for stores that serve children (if  
in my country there are some small stores )and i bought things, i forged a total of 6 dollars(in my country they are worth more), i didn't even do it for the money, i just wanted to feel the adrenaline, i also stole some expensive pens in supermarkets, the next week they stole my backpack, which was worth about 60 dollars, karma is a bitch, i know, has anyone done stupid things?
