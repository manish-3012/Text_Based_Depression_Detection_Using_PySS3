I feel like Iâ€™m gonna explode :O My crush texted me today but I havenâ€™t been able to see him for months. I thought he didnâ€™t like me back (I havenâ€™t talked to him about it since corona interrupted all that), but now Iâ€™m starting to question it. I told my friend the other day I thought he didnâ€™t like me and was crying and all thatâ€™s shit, so Iâ€™ll kinda feel like an idiot texting her about this change. At the same time I havenâ€™t talked to this one friend who also also friends with my crush in a while, so Iâ€™m low key tempted to rant to him about it too. However that could backfire really easily. I would just confess to my crush but like I said I havenâ€™t seen him in forever. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna combust soon...
