Schools should give each class a maximum of 20 minutes of homework a night. I know that 20 minutes isnâ€™t much but when you consider that most kids have 6 to 7 classes, if each class gave the maximum amount of homework then that would still add up to like 2 and a half hours of homework which is stupid. If Iâ€™m already going to school for seven and a half hours a day then why do I have homework? I would prefer for them to just keep us for nine hours and give us no homework because most of us arenâ€™t productive at home. It just doesnâ€™t make sense to me.
I just needed to vent because everything is overwhelming right now, I have seven and a half hours of school a day followed by two hours of homework and then another two hours of wrestling practice. Itâ€™s like teachers donâ€™t realize that we have a life outside of school. By the time I get free time itâ€™s like 8:30 and Iâ€™m just tired...
