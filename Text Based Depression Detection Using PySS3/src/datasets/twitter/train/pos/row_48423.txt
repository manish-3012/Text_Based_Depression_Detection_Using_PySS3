For all my friends who have screen time set by their parents... Here is the Solution  This is how to big brain screen time. Ask your parents to change the time by like a minute or whatever you want. turn on screen recording. Next give the phone to ur parents to change the password if they agreed. Get back your phone and go to the recording and just watch the buttons being pressed. Worked for me hope it works for you.
