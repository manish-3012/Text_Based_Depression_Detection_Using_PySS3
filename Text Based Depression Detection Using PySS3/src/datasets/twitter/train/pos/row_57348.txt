Hi everyone Recently I have kinda been wanting to go vegetarian, as much as I love things like steak and chicken, I want to do it for health benefits. I am not overweight, I only weigh in at about 57kg but I am not happy with my health. 

Point is that my family are prominent meat eaters and my family isnâ€™t the healthiest. My Dad is very nice and supportive but in his view he doesnâ€™t see how people can live without meat. 

I was wondering if there are any other people in my situation/ or have been and know what to do.
