Everyone complains how spoilers ruin the movie. But also watching the movie while you're too *young.* That's like ingraving all the contents of the movie at the same time, and getting movie spoilers from your past self, because your consciousness shift is so damn weird. I've already ruined a couple of good movies like Big Hero 6 like this.
