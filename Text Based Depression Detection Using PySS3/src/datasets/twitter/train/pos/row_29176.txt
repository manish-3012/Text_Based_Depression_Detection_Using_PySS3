Ok, so you know how any show with magic has that one body swap episode? I cannot fucking stand them. It makes me so uncomfortable. Those episodes are physically painful to watch, but I usually power through just in case something plot relevant happens. I have seen 1, maybe 2 shows do it right. The Owl House did it well because only one of the three characters that swapped had to actually pretend to be that person, the others just had fun self contained adventures, and the one that did didn't have to very much. I remember the Gravity Falls one being pretty good too, but I don't remember it well enough to say. And now I have found the worst one. Little Witch Academia, S1E12. I am 2 MINUTES after the actual swap happens and I can't go on. This will be the first episode of any show that I have skipped, period. I just can't do it. 

Unrelated, does anyone know if anything plot relevant happen in S1E12 of Little Witch Academia? If so, could you fill me in?
