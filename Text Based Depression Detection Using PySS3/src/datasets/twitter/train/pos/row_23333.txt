To the teenager that posted the memes about homework and stress/depression I work as a teacher (downvote me for it, I love my job). The truth is that very little science support homework, while many research papers have been written with the conclusion that pupils with homework vs pupils without homework barely show any difference in knowledge and grades. 

HOWEVER, when I try explaining this to parents, they get the feeling that the school isnt up to standard because they grew up with doing most of their studying outside the classroom. In their opinion, schools should give you homework. I started my classes this year without homework, but your parents have driven and pushed me to give two home assignments per week (and they still want more). Last year a family transfered my pupil to another school, and our admin/principle was furious. Even though the pupils grades soared high. 

In conclusion; if you want change, make your parents complain about it. Homework is more work for us teachers as well, and I am damn well qualified to teach you enough stuff during your time in my classroom.
