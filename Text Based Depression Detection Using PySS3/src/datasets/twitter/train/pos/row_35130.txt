Is it weird that I'm thinking about making a family at the age of 18? Like title says. I feel the urge to become a caring father. 
I would like to meet a future wife and a caring mother. 
I don't want just a casual relationship. I want it to be more than just that.

I've been thinking a lot about this. People at my age mostly just enter casual relationships and I don't think they think like me. They would totally disagree. But I feel other way. 

When I told about it to my best friend he just laughed. 
I'm not really sure what's so funny. Is being mature laughable? I just don't get it. I feel like no one is on my side. Is there something wrong with me? 

Welp sorry for me rambling, but I needed to vent.
