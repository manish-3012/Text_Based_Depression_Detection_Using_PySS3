Does Instagram show all messages as notifications regardless if theyâ€™ve been deleted? I texted a girl and said hey. 

She said hi. 

I didnâ€™t know how to respond to that and then I was like, â€œoh damn I have a crush on her, the fuck do I do?â€ 

So I said â€œwydâ€ and then I was like thatâ€™s too clingy. So I deleted it and said â€œhow you beenâ€ deleted it again. 

So, right now Iâ€™m just sticking with â€œyou going to school on Monday?â€ 

So I need to know if insta is going to show her all the previous texts. Help me.
