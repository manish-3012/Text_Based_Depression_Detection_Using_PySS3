I need some advice for some problems about exercise I have I really want to exercise I just want to lose weight. I keep giving up but the urge to try again always comes back and I always feel more and more confident.

I need some advice for some things that are preventing me though

1. Crippling anxiety. I constantly fear people are watching me and making fun of me. I can also get an anxiety attack when it gets hard to breathe after an exercise.

2. Fear of medical complications. A bit similar to number 1....but anyways, last time I tried to go on a long walk, I got heat exhaustion and now the very feeling of humid air outside makes me so nervous. I also sometimes fear Iâ€™ll break a bone from doing something stupid.

3. I donâ€™t know how to stop giving up. Pretty self explanatory
