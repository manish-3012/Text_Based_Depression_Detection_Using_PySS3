How do I control my anxiety? Whenever I have anxiety from school my stomach hurts then the pain spreads to my chest,neck and finally it comes to me needing to puke.
I am scared of exams and a lot of things not of socializing.
:( I can't deal with this I dealt with this thing for 3 years.
I started 6th grade and that is when anxiey attacked me.
I have to skip school sometimes from the big fear.
Help?
