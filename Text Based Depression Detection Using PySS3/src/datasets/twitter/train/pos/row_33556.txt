It was good while it lasted, but here I go. Alright. I turn 20 in five days, and i figured I'd say a few words to my teenage years that I'll never return to and never get to try again.

I got so many things out of the way as a teen and I'm glad i don't have to jump the hurdle as an adult. 

I came out to my parents as trans a little over three years ago, and my dad just started to use my chosen name. Big step.

I graduated high school, something i saw as a near unnatainable goal when i was a kid.

I fell in love. Got hurt. Fell out of love. Learned the importance of loving yourself in a relationship, learned the importance of trust and loyalty.

And now here I am, out of school, done with my teenage years, and moving on to a new chapter in my life. It's so strange to think when my mom was my age, I was born.

My teen years weren't amazing. I lived in a low-to-middle-class family. We couldn't afford a lot. I wasn't always the best to my parents, but they always wanted the best for me, even if their methods made no fking sense at all sometimes.

My advice to everyone younger than me: don't burn that bridge with your family. I almost did when i turned 18 and I'm glad i didn't. I've got a 2 year old brother and I'm very glad I'm going to be around to see him grow up.

I won't miss my teenage years, but I'm so glad that i experienced them. I'm glad for the two or three good friends that have stuck with me for years. I'm glad that i learned what I learned, and finally, I'm glad this shit is over.

Farewell, teenage years. I'll remember your bittersweet nostalgia fondly.
