Iâ€™m deleting my account. I make this last post for my self.
I donâ€™t find meaningful enjoyment in anything Reddit offers (other than porn).
In all of my time using this app, i havenâ€™t had a single good laugh at anything. I simply think I use this app (and 9GAG, which i will also be deleting) as a break from the real world. Like a real-life timeout, and that I donâ€™t think that is good or natural at all.
I wanna face reality more.
