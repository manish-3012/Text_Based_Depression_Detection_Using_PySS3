Currently planing a (lightly modded) Java SMP! Message me for details! 


Hey all, 

Making a SMP server for Java, anyone who is interested can message me. Rules and regulations of the server will be set by the players who are interested in joining. 

Message me and I can invite you to a discord, where everyone who wants to play can decide as a majority how the server will be run! (Rules, difficulty, name etc.) 

Looking for active players,

Thanks!
