Are 1 in fucking 8 people really depressed? Iâ€™m pretty worried about myself right now. I thought the statistics were much lower. Iâ€™ve felt this weird sadness in my heart (?) for a little while now. I feel like I have pretty bad social anxiety and insecurities I didnâ€™t have before. 

I know the obvious answer is to tell my parents and seek professional help but I sort of want to figure stuff out myself before I do anything. Is there a sure way to test if Iâ€™m depressed? Is there things I should be doing? Thanks
