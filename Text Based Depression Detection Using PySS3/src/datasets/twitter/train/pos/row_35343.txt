Do you think homework is an essential part of education? Personally, I don't think homework is essential for education.  The extra work can impact sleep schedules and reduce the time people have for others and themselves. This impacts people in many ways from mood changes and an impairment of certain cognitive abilities such as attention spans ,retention of information, and general awareness. Second, if I have to spend five, six, seven hours in classes, I want to do what I want with my time. People shouldn't have to sit in classes for significant parts of their day only to have to take their own time to do more work for them later.
