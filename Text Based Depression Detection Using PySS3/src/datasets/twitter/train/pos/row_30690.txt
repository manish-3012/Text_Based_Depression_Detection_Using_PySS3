My parents are going fcking crazy over a girl I just want to vent here 

I have a girl friend (not to be confused with girlfriend) and my parents are going nuts. 

I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t have a friend who has XX chromosomes without them needing to be my girlfriend. 

They are all set on her liking me when I know for a fact she doesnâ€™t.

I just donâ€™t know what to do, because my mom just texted her mom inviting her over, after telling them â€œno itâ€™s fine weâ€™ll hang out another timeâ€

Does anyone other guy here have this issue?
