Am I normal? Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship at age 15, and although that sounds normal, Iâ€™ve been given like 30 opportunities, I just donâ€™t take them because my brain works in a way where it looks for escape routes. I feel trapped the second a commitment is actually being made that involves another. Iâ€™ve kissed many chicks before, but then I just take off before feelings are involved? Am I a monster?
