Stress is really starting to build up. does school not understand that online class does not mean I have more free time? no I don't have time for this huge asignment. they really have the balls to say: 'you are at home anyway so you have time enough' and then expect us to organize a group activity with primary school kids and get our local government to agree. I still have a testweek coming up and 5 unfinished assignments. I'm back to having panick attacks I thought I left behind after a depression.
