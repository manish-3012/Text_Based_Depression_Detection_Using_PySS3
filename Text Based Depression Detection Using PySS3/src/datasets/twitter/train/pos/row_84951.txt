Iâ€™m turning 20 in under a month and have no idea how to feel about it. A couple days ago, I was talking to my friend and he asked me about my plans for my birthday. He said â€œyour birthday is in 20 days nowâ€ and that just hit me like a truck for a couple reasons. (I) How is it November already in 10 days, (II) I am going to be 20 years old. Wtf? And finally, what the fuck have I done with my life? 
Almost all my memories are of being a teenager and not being one anymore seems weirdly adult-like. 
I feel like my teenage years have been kinda unremarkable. I have a lot of experiences and a lot of fun but at the end of the day, if my past is any indication for my future. Iâ€™m not really excited. My past relationships have frankly sucked. My friends are great but I feel like Iâ€™m losing touch with them more and more and above all. I donâ€™t want to spend my college years stuck at home in this bloody pandemic. 
Sorry if this ran a bit long but I needed to get it off my chest
