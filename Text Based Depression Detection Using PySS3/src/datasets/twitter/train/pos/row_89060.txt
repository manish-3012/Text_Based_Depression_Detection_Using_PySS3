we need to stop thinking shih tzuâ€™s and similar dog breeds are cute ever single shih tzu dog i ever met is like 18 years old and its name is coco, every single fucking shih tzu name is coco. these dogs are so annoying and smell like it was playing in the trash bin for hours. i feel like society has lost the need for small crusty dogs. thank you for coming to my ted talk
