My plan if I ever somehow manage to form a band Make music, loud ass daft shit. But not daft in the horrific annoying way, but daft in the weird charming way. Honestly I just want to experiment with music and break the rules in a way that still sounds good. I'm talking fucked up chords and progressions aswell as clashing opposite genres together, like heavy metal and soft pop.
Although that's just a dream, it probably won't happen, but it will be a fun dream to try and pursue regardless
