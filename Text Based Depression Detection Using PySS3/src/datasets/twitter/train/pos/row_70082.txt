why do i trust Ryan Reynolds so much? i mean he is selling mint mobile, which from everything iâ€™ve heard is great. itâ€™s cheap, and itâ€™s running off of the t-mobile network, so you basically get the same service as t-mobile 

i swear this isnâ€™t an ad for mint mobile, iâ€™ve just looked way too far into this
