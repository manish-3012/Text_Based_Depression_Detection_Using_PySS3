Anyone watch Hellâ€™s Kitchen? So Iâ€™m watching season 11. I forget which season and it comes to the first dinner service and as always they suck. But if youâ€™re going to Hellâ€™s Kitchen arenâ€™t you supposed to know that there is a very good chance you wonâ€™t get served? Like if I was going I would 100% eat a full meal so that 3 hours into dinner service when I finally got my meal I would be hungry but not ready to rip someoneâ€™s head off.
