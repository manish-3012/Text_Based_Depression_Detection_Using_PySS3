You have not, and will not ever see a perfect circle. Let me explain.

The closest thing you have probably seen to a perfect circle, is a picture on a screen. Those have tiny pixels, which make it so it isnâ€™t a perfect circle.

In real life, nobody can draw a perfect circle. Even with a tool like a compass, it shifts a tiny bit. It wonâ€™t be a lot that you can notice, but it does shift. 

Objects canâ€™t be perfect circles either. It was made by either a machine or a person. As I just said, people canâ€™t make perfect circles. Machines on the other hand, still canâ€™t. They have been programmed to move. This means that it wonâ€™t ever be perfect, because it will move up, down, left, and right. It cannot be perfect.
