so I saw this post about how this sub is in loops...  so this sub is in loops de loops(ok then make a change) blah blah and everyone disagrees with a good post(not everyone, it's just a joke about the original post, obviously we just found it funny to like) blah blah, then people complain more(yea, yea) blah blah, then people do more shit that is dumb and repetitive(as I said make a change by posting good stuff) blah blah blah, it really annoying(deal with it if you don't like it, if this sub like it's then you might have to just shut and deal with it).

Why am I doing this?

The same reason people make parody posts and useless posts that keep regurgitating the same, common opinions. (see I understand what you saying but the reason why we like it because it's stupid fun, then when some make a hate post about it, we don't disagree, we find it funny.)

Thank you for coming to my ~~Disagreement~~ Ted talk
