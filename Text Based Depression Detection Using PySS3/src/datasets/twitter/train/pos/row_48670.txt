I started playing with 3d simulation Over the past few years I have watched several 3d animation videos on intagram and decided to start making my videos.

After several attempts and video lessons on youtube, I finally managed to set up something

I will leave the link here and if you have any idea what I can do animation, please leave it in the comments

I'm doing it for fun, but I plan to use these videos for a science homework assignment later this year
