Today marks my 19th birthday and I'm still alone. I've always been alone. I went to a small private school system from kindergarten to sophomore year. And the problem is that I didn't fit in. Since it was a school system, the people in my class never really changed and so since I didn't fit in the first year, I didn't fit in any year. Eventually I moved to the public school system so I could enter an early college program and I made a few friends in high school but it was too little too late. I've never felt loved. Ever. And I know that eventually I'll find someone and blah blah blah, but I'm tired of waiting. I get to see basically everyone I know be happy with their significant others and I have no one. And it's not like I will be able to find someone at school because I only have one class per week because of Covid and everyone has to sit 6 ft apart. I just want to be held. I want to be someone's protector. I want to be someone's safe place. I want to be missed. I want to finally have my first kiss at 19 fucking years old. I'm tired of being "the single friend" 

And to those of you that are very attentive, yes, today is my real 19th birthday.
