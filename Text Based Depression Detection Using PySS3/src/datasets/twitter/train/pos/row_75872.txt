I hate the pandemic I know that everyone must be sick and tired of hearing about the pandemic, but here I am late to the complaining party.

It feels like every day I hear at least one teacher mention how it's ok to be stressed or anxious right now, I mean, it's a pandemic. But I shouldn't feel that way, all I have to complain about is about some of my friends doing virtual school. Some people are close to other people who have died, and here I am all pissy with my perfectly healthy family. What right do I have to be upset? 

Two years ago my friend group was pretty 50/50 boy girl ratio with roughly six each.I(as a girl) am much closer to the girls in my friend group and have always had a hard time feeling like I could fit in with the boys if I was the only girl there. In the simplest way to put it their sense of humor tends to sway to the offensive side and I'm just not a fan. But I'm also an introvert and can't easily change the conversation without the risk of being called out, but when more then one girl is there with the boys the conversation always seems to find a happy medium and it's all good for everyone. Two years ago my best friend moved across the country. Then the pandemic hit and my next two best friends chose virtual school. Another girl moved away. And the last girl sits at a full lunch table somewhere else and I have no classes with her. 

With the pandemic I am increasingly finding myself not being able to fit in with my friends. And I know that in the grand scheme of pandemic problems mine are quite trivial but it feels good to get it out of my head.
