I just realized something if you blink, you use your upper eyelids



if you wink, you use your lower eyelids



it's literally impossible to wink with your upper eyelids, no matter how hard you try, your upper eyelids will always be equally covering your eyes, try it, you'll think you're doing it, but you'll actually automatically start using your lower eyelids to 'meet up' with your upper one



okay so all this, has led me to the conclusion, that the answer to the question if mike wazowski blinks or winks, depends on which eyelid he uses.
