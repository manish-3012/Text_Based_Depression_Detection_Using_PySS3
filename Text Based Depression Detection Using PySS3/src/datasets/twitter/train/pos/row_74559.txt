How TF do y'all do anything wearing masks I went to the grocery store for and found myself lifting my mask quite often after about an hour. I was literally getting nauseous from breathing in my air (I might just have bad breath idk)

Just to clarify, I'm not encouraging not wearing masks, I just haven't been to any crowded places in a while and I stay home almost all day so I haven't worn masks that much
