Helpful Youtube Channel TL;DR This channel called Psych2Go was really helpful, making videos about psychology and I'd recommend watching/sharing some of their videos.  
I don't know if this is against the rules as advertising, but there's this channel that I've been watching on Youtube, it's called [Psych2Go](https://www.youtube.com/user/Psych2GoTv). The animations may seem weird at first, but the videos have been really informative about psychology, at least for me. They talk about relationships, the symptoms and signs of certain mental illnesses, and the meanings of things such as dreams. The channel has really helped me during covid-19 to identify if someone could have depression (they recommend going to a doctor if the viewer can relate to the video as self-diagnosing/treating usually isn't the best choice), and also it helped me talk to others more easily, the people around me generally know me better now and my family can talk pretty openly about psychology now that I broke the ice with a video link. (I sent a video talking about [emotional burnout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDvnw8eOjFQ), and I think some of you people can relate to the symptoms mentioned). They have helped me handle tough situations where my friends almost all blocked me (TL;DR I said my friend was bad at a game, they all said I was mean), but I worked it out with them, and not in a dirty, rough way either, thanks to the tips from the channel.  


The channel didn't fix my whole life magically, but it still did have a very meaningful impact.
