So I met my old third-grade classmate and got hit with a bit of a shock wave Basically his mom and my mom were friends, but he and I didn't see each other very much. Earlier today I forgot she was coming over just to say hi (also she gave us chocolates, so double points), and he was there as well. Except I didn't actually recognize him until he spoke a little bit. 

And now I'm thinking 'Good lord, when'd that happen??' Last time I saw that guy was third grade and I hadn't even heard about him since. Now he somehow has much more hair, his voice is deeper (same speech patterns), and damn is he tall. He's a year younger than me and is somehow a head taller than me! I'm just gonna assume it's a sign I ought to get out more.

Also: the chocolates were good.
