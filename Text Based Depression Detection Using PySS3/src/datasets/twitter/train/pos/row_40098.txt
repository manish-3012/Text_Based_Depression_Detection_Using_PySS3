Idc what you say, and you can make fun of me all you want but watching anime can really help some people I learned most of my social skills tbh. Iâ€™m saying this because 4 years ago I had panic attacks when thinking about talking to literally anyone. I had to present all my presentations to my teachers in private because iâ€™d break down if I had people watching. Then I got into anime, and honestly I learned most of my social skills from it. Like respect, empathy, compassion, manners, etc. an now I have a gf and can talk to her parents about myself for hours. Thatâ€™s a pretty big transition if you ask me.
