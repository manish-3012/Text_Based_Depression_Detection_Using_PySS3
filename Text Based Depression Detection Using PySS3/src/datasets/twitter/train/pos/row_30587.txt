Next gen console, here I come! So a few days ago, me and my dad were able to buy an Xbox Series X from the Best Buy website (heâ€™s a gamer too). The website says we should be able to pick it up at my local Best Buy today. Iâ€™m so excited to finally have a next gen console! Iâ€™ll keep you updated and Iâ€™ll post again when I get it later today.
