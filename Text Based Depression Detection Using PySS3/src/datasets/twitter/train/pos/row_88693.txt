[Potental trigger warning] apperently i'm transphobic cause i wouldn't date a transgender person What are your thoughts on this? Its a little odd considering the fact that it was about sexual requirements. Btw i'm not averted(is that the right word?) Towards trans ppl as far as friendship is concerned, just incase anyone brought it up
