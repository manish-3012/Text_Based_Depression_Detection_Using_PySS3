Feeling happy for the first time in years I started texting with people and i feel more happy than ever. Someone texted me "gn sweet dreams" and i literally cried because thats the nicest thing someones ever done to me. Im a loner and i havent really spoken with anyone exept my parents in months and it felt really good to have someone that cares for me.
