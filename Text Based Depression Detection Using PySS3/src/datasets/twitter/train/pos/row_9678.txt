The case of the vanished chicken nugget First off I would like to tell you that I donâ€™t know where else to put this story. And this story is 100% true 

Back story 

So I was going to make some chicken nuggets so I went down stairs grab the chicken nugget bag and placed to of them in the air fryer (they are more like big chicken tenders but for my sake Iâ€™ll call them chicken nuggets) and cooked it for 9 minutes. 9 minutes went by and I grabbed them and placed them on my plate. They felt flimsy so I cut one to make sure they were cooked and turns out they were not so I put both of them back in and turned the air fryer to cook them for 15 more minutes. I went upstairs and texted my mom to tell me when the 15 minutes are up. 15 minutes go by and my moon calls me down and I went to check on the chicken nuggets and there are only 1 left (non cut one) so I asked the 2 people who here down here (my mom and older sister) and they both said they did not eat it. 

So letâ€™s start with the 2 people

Mom: so my mom wanted a chicken nugget but I already started the fryer so I didnâ€™t make her one (I know Iâ€™m an ass hole but plz keep reading) 

My older sister: she was downstairs eating a chicken salad sandwich and chips. Thatâ€™s all I have of her

So I think it is most likely my mom since she wanted a chicken nugget but she did not get one so I think she took it. 

I donâ€™t really know what else to put here so if you have some questions please feel free to ask away.
