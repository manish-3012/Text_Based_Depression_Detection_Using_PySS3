Hello, r/Teenagers. Teacher here. I wanted to give you an honest accounting of which annoying parts of remote learning (turning on mics, cameras, dress code, etc.) are real and which ones are bullshit. I've seen a lot of memes and posts complaining about the different things teachers make you do during online classes. I thought it might be helpful to tell you which ones you're completely right about (shh, don't tell them I told you) and which ones are actually important.  


1) \*\*Dress codes, inappropriate attire, etc.\*\*  
This one is total bullshit. It doesn't matter what you wear, as long as you're wearing something. Seriously, who cares? Schools or teachers that enforce dress codes during remote learning are making a bad situation worse. You should be comfortable.

2) \*\*Location. eg. laying in bed during class\*\*  
I don't know why anyone cares about this one either. Whether you're in bed, on your couch, at the kitchen table...who cares? It's annoying that some schools have rules about this sort of thing. Again, you should be comfortable.

3) \*\*Please turn on your cameras\*\*  
Ok, here's where I stop pretending to be cool and make enemies. It's super important that you turn on your camera, even if it makes you more comfortable not to. You have no idea how much teachers feed off of and respond to body language. This is the main way a decent teacher can tell if you're interested, if you're confused, or even if you're bored or tired. Teaching to empty black windows feels terrible; it's like standing in front of a classroom of empty desks. There's no feedback at all, so we just flail around. Imagine doing stand-up comedy to an empty theater and you'll understand how humiliating it feels. All that I ask for is having your full head visible, so I can see your facial expression, and so that you can nod 'yes' or 'no'.

4) \*\*Eyes forward\*\*  
This one is stupid. You don't have to be staring into the camera to be able to hear and understand. You're not always looking right at the teacher during a real class, so unless you're clearly doing something you shouldn't be, I don't really care where you're looking.

5) \*\*Please turn on your mics\*\*  
This is the front-line in the war between teachers and students during remote learning. I understand how tempting and powerful the notion of being able to mute yourself is--a power you never had in the Before Times. However, here's what it looks like from a teacher's perspective: I ask a question to a screen full of people leaning back in their chairs/beds with their mics off. I absolutely \*know\* that nobody is going to answer it. Getting up the nerve to answer a question in class or participate in a discussion is hard enough, having to sit up, lean forward, and click a button makes it almost impossible.  


A muted mic also means that nobody will \*ask\* any questions either. Asking questions is incredibly important for learning, as the smart kids are well aware. It's also important for the teachers. We screw up all the time and we rely on students to ask questions about things we forgot to mention. We even need you to correct us when we're wrong (Personally, I can't write on a board and talk at the same time, so I often end up filling the board with really weird errors).  


A caveat to this is that, if you have a noisy house or a malfunctioning microphone, it's definitely better to keep it muted. You should also be free to mute when you're doing work or when it's not an active discussion or lesson. 

  


  
6) \*\*Changing your background\*\*  
This one is fine. I don't think it's as hilarious as you do, though. So I just ignore it.

7) \*\*Petting your dog/cat\*\*  
Ugh, fine, I guess. As long as you're still able to write/type.

8)\*\*Food, drink, props, etc.\*\*  
Again, who cares if students eat? In fact, since there's no risk of you making a mess in the classroom, it should be even more acceptable during remote learning. It's ridiculous that a kid got expelled for playing with a toy gun during online school. You're stuck at home without normal classroom interaction; anything that makes it easier for you without disrupting others is fine by me.  


&amp;#x200B;

9)\*\*Parents\*\*  
This one is a dealbreaker. Your parents should absolutely stay the f\*ck out of it. They shouldn't be sitting next to you during class, or walking in to check on things, or--holy shit--asking or answering questions. Can you imagine how insane it would be if your parent walked into the classroom and acted that way?? (In case you didn't already know, teachers generally hate parents. A dumb or annoying student is nothing compared to a dumb or annoying parent).  


  
Final thoughts:  
I will be the first to admit it: remote learning is completely terrible. It's terrible for you; it's terrible for us. We're not able to teach effectively, and you're not able to learn effectively. You're isolated from social interaction and presented with tons of easily-available distractions. Nobody wins in this scenario.  


I hope this post was somewhat enlightening. Feel free to call me out on anything you don't agree with. If there's something annoying I forgot to put on the list, ask, and I'll do my best to tell you the truth about it.
