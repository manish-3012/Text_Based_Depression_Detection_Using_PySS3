My thoughts on Trump testing positive I see a lot of people saying that celebrating the presidentâ€™s positive test is disgusting, but those same people sure as fuck didnâ€™t criticize the president when his actions and dismissal lead to and worsened the pandemic, which has killed 208k people SO FAR. 

Honestly I hope heâ€™s charged rather than killed by the virus (at his own hands) but then again I canâ€™t think of any other punishments other than death for the murder of 208,000+ people.
