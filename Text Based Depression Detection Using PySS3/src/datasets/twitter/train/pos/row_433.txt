A week and a half after going back to school a full third of my school will be self isolating within the week I live in the UK and we recently got sent back to school, within a week our new cases have doubled in the ehole country, and an entire year at my school is already off, with classes dropping like flies. Everyone i know is getting ill either because they got the vius or our immune systems are weak due to lockdown. I would give a month at most until another total lockdown. If you look at the cases it speaks for itself, the cases rise in the weekdays and flats out on weekend. Masks physically cannot do anything to help either, people are so densely packed its pointless. But oh no the economy comes first doesnt it?

TLDR: government cares about money over safety.
