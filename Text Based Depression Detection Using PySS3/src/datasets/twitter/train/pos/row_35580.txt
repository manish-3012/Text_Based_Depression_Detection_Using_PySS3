Ahh goddamnit i hate weekends Iâ€™m always stuck at home cause I donâ€™t have my license, my mom goes to her friends house every Saturday until like 10-11 pm and my dad is almost always hung over or busy all weekend too :/ all my friends either work or have other more important friends and I just ugh Iâ€™m tired of doing nothing :/ I wish I could at least just go drive around but I canâ€™t even do that. I guess I could walk but thereâ€™s not even anything to walk to and itâ€™s raining :/
