I have a slight issue How the fuck do I get a full boner? I haven't gotten a full mega boner for a few months and especially with my 0.8" of fat my dick had been looking extra small lately. Without pushing down the fat, what you would see is a 5.8 incher. Not bad, but not good either. I think my peak erection was like around 6.5, but pushing the fat down I swear it would be 7.

Anyways, main point is, I can't seem to get a rock hard cock. It just seems to be mildly hard. It really sucks. Need help
