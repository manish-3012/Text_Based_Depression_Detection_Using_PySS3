I just feel awful right now about gym class and I need to let it out someplace So it's like this okay

1. I'm like 80 pounds overweight (that's 36 kg for you europeans out there) and I never exercise
2. All my gym classes have exercises based on what a typical kid my age should be able to do
3. If I actually try doing the exercise then I invariably end up flustered, sweaty, and gasping for breath, because I'm in no physical condition to do some of the exercises
4. I don't want anybody to see me that way. It's embarrassing. So I usually just completely avoid doing it if I can
5. Since I actively avoid exercise I am 80 pounds overweight and never exercise

I'm medically obese. In order to be a healthy BMI I'd have to grow a foot and a half. It takes me so long to do a mile run that the teacher actually gives up trying to time me before I finish. I don't think I've ever actually been able to complete a push-up before my arms give out. I'm getting a D in gym class because of my unwillingness to be seen exercising. 

I can't keep living like this, where my own flab is the one thing keeping me from getting rid of my flab
