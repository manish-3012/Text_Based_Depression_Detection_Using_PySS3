I donâ€™t know what to do anymore The girl iâ€™ve been dating for 2 years told me she doesnâ€™t feel the same way anymore. I honestly donâ€™t know what to doðŸ˜ž i think about her all the time, i miss her so much. Iâ€™ve dated before but the feelings i would get when i was around her and how she could make my mood go up with just a text. I love her to death, ill never feel this way about anyone else. I just wish i could rewind. Iâ€™m so depressed ðŸ˜–
