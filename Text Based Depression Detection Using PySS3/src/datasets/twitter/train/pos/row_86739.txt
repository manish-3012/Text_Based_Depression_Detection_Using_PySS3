Dumped a dude last valentine's day So I've been talking to this dude for over a year now and we really hit it off although it was an on again off again type of relationship and we weren't really dating but there was something going one between us long story short had to take a break cause of personal problems so we didn't talk for like a month, I chatted him once he replied then after that is was weeks of not talking again then my friend showed me this discord server where the dude I've been talking to is sending multiple nudes of different women. After that I knew that I was done with him so the second he chatted back I literally said what I wanted and never talked to him again. Too bad tho he was the first guy that made me feel like he liked me for my personality and not in a sexual way. Also this was all on the night before valentine's day it was just eating me up so I had to talk about it.
