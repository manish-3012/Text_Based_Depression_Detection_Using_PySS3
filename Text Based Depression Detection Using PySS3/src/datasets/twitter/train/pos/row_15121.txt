Rant about my schoolâ€™s new grading system. So all of the schools in my district have adopted a new grading system.  The lowest grade you can get is DNM, or Does Not Meet. Above that is a P, or Partial. Above P is M for Meets, and then E for exceeds. When I first saw this, it made sense. But the teachers at my high-school have changes into this weird individual-based grading system. Basically, they decided that Meet didnâ€™t mean that you met the standard, but met their expectation of you. That means that if a teacher thinks that you will exceed on a standard, you will get an M if you do exceed. This essentially penalizes you for consistently doing well, and rewarding you for doing bad most of the time, but doing well occasionally. Because of this new system, I canâ€™t get an E grade anymore because thatâ€™s what the teacher expects of me. Now, since no human can keep up with doing significantly more work than required for more than a few months, I have become burned out.  I canâ€™t constantly exceed, so now Iâ€™m getting partial grades for meeting the standard, while other students are getting exceed grades for doing barely anything, because they donâ€™t do good all of the time.

And thatâ€™s the end of the rant. I just needed to get that off of my chest.
