My sleep deprivation has finally caught up to me. My lack of sleep is now effecting my decision making skills. Iâ€™m up till midnight doing homework and wake up at 6. Apparently teens are suppose to get 9-10 hrs of sleep while Iâ€™m getting 6. I still have missing homework and upcoming homework. My grades are the worst they have been this year. And for whatever reason Iâ€™m wasting time making a post about how tired I am.
