Please help me save my dog.This is neither a troll nor something that I do to get karma. My dog have ate nothing in the past day.Today we thought we'd give him some medication.But when we opened the Kennel now to give him medication,he didn't come out.He couldn't even get down to the ground.He is shivering intensly and it's almost like he's dying.We don't know what to do.He is not even drinking water.Water is pouring down from his mouth.We can't take him to doctor because we don't live in US and we don't have a car.Doctors are not showing interest to come here.Someone please tell me what could be wrong or please drop the name of a sub that I can ask this question to Idk where to ask this.Please this is not a joke or anything.Help me out.
PS:Sorry for my bad English.
Edit:Doctor we called just told us that he won't come because he only have to consult if it's before 3 pm
