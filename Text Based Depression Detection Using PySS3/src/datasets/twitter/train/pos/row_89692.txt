u/a-burner- is a liar and here is the proof Hi guys, so I was scrolling through the sub and I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/mjhtjr/the_love_of_my_life_aka_my_girlfriend_just_killed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post as many of you may have done as well. At first, I wonâ€™t lie, I was sceptical. People lie about serious things like this all the time in this sub and I wish I didnâ€™t have to be sceptical like this but unfortunately, this is another one of those fake karma whoring posts. So upon seeing the post, I did some digging into post history and such and found out some very crucial information.

FYI, I have screenshots of all the posts I will give as evidence so if he deletes them, I have backups saved.

First off, itâ€™s important to note that OP is posting in the teen sub, meaning he claims to be a teenager. Furthermore in a follow up to his original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/mjm1ls/how_do_i_get_over_the_death_of_the_love_of_my_life/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) he claims to be 14 turning 15 in may, and his girlfriend is 15.

This contradicts with his post history however, as I will give you a list of posts and I will discuss them below the list. (https://www.reddit.com/r/SnapchatSext/comments/jbv6dz/22_mff_not_looking_for_sexting_just_a_request_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/SnapchatSext/comments/jbv5xy/22_mff_not_looking_for_sexting_but_just_a_request/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRedditAfterDark/comments/jargrw/where_can_i_find_some_good_sexting_group_chat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/j9e4l1/man_fuck_sexting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/sextingsnapchat/comments/j8usvx/22_mff_this_sub_like_every_other_sexting_sub_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/sextingfriendfinder/comments/j829di/22_mfa_message_to_mods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (https://www.reddit.com/r/sextingfriendfinder/comments/j828p6/message_to_mods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

So from the posts above we can conclude this information, OP is interesting and partakes in sexting, something a majority of 14 year olds wouldnâ€™t do and especially wouldnâ€™t post on Reddit looking for people to do this with and discuss it. Also, we can see OP describe himself as a 22 year old, a blatant contradictory statement to his recent claims. Even if this set of posts are all lies and he really is 14, why should we trust him now?

To conclude, I want to say to u/a-burner- a big fuck you. You are absolute scum of the earth. Who thinks its ok to fake someones death for internet points that do NOTHING for you? And to the rest of you people reading, please, I beg you, check post and comment historyâ€™s before believing things like this. I know it would be amazing if we could believe everything we see on here but it just isnâ€™t the case.

I want to end off by saying I havenâ€™t gone through all posts and Iâ€™ve only looked at a handful of comments so if youâ€™re interested in looking for my contradicting posts or comments, absolutely do so. I will be updating this thread based on what he does/says i.e. deleting his posts or account, making new posts, etc.

Stay safe everyone!
