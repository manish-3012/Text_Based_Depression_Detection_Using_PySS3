asked my friends to quarantine for my birthday and now I think everyoneâ€™s pissed at me :,) 

I just want to hang out with my friends for my 17th birthday and I texted them this morning, asking if theyâ€™d be willing to at least quarantine for a week before my birthday in March and I just canâ€™t shake the feeling that I pissed everyone off
