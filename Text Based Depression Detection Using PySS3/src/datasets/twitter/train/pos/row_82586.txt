i accidentally made a really bad joke in front of my aunt and uncle we were talking about how no one likes marmalade and my aunt said she does so I went â€œthen youâ€™re nobodyâ€ and she went â€œbut I donâ€™t wanna be nobodyâ€

and that made me instinctively go, for some fucking reason,

â€œguess 3/5â€™s doâ€




^im ready to be cremated alive now
