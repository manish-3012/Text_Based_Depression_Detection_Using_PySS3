I have a very serious and confusing problem that I need to get out of me, fast. Alright, so, this all happened yesterday; This might sound really crazy and stupid, and I'd be with you on that. So please try to stay with me in this post.

Yesterday, I was scrolling around the internet, and I found one of the SCP stories; SCP-1733. You can check out the story for yourself if you want. Now, this story for SOME reason, made me get obsessed with it.

Now, the obsession part is kind of the problem. I have a fear that, if I think about this specific story too much, then I'll get obsessed with it for life and go insane. I've been thinking about this story for like almost 2 days now, and on the day I first got obsessed with it, I actually got distracted from my online school work.

I've tried to get it off of my head; That seems to work, kind of. I'll be doing anything like I'd usually do; Playing video games or watching YouTube videos. But, no matter what, I'd still have the story on my mind. I have no idea why this is happening, and I'm really scared for my mental state.

Do you guys know what I can do? I'd appreciate any help.
