Stop saying your donâ€™t know how to talk to girls Of course you know how to talk to girls. Weâ€™re humans, not apes. 

Just be calm, crack a few jokes, listen and respect boundaries. All it takes. Literally all. 

Find something you have in common, talk about it, and just let the conversation go wherever it goes. Itâ€™s the simplest thing on the planet. This is coming from someone who panics and sweats every time someone new talks to them. Itâ€™s nerve-racking, but so is talking to anyone else. Treat her as if sheâ€™s just â€œone of the boys.â€ If she seems turned off or uncomfortable, you should probably stop.

I doubt this is just for girls, Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s just how to talk to anyone 101. 

Relax, talk, do dumb shit together, have fun
