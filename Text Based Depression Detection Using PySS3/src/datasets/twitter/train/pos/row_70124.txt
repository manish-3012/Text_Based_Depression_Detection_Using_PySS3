Having trouble deciding my future career path Honestly I have no idea what I wanna be when I'm older and if I keep putting this off its gonna be a big problem lmao.  I've done a careers course to try to find a path and sort out my future plans but all I've concluded is I suck at most of the arts and science.   While that has eliminated a couple paths I still dunno how to go about finding a domain I want to pursue.  

Any advice to spare a lost child before she slips down the hill of procrastination into a ditch called time to submit uni applications.   It is greatly appreciated
