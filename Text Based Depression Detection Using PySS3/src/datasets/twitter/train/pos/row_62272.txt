A poem about my parents From the moment I was born,

I was supposed to follow your rules

And I did, I followed them

Yet you still are not proud and to that I must mourn

The loss of my freedom, you both are such fools



Do this and do that

Be obedient and you must act,

Like and angel like a saint

Or else you'll face the consequences that you hate



I'm sick of feeling trapped

I'm sick of being wrapped,

In your unrealistic expectations

Never give in to the temptations



Be a good person and you'll be rewarded

Fuck that all I've received is warnings

And punishment even tho I try my best

What more do you want?

Please give this a rest



I love you is what I feel obligated to say

But it becomes more meaningless every day, 

You listen to him now, never to me

Don't you understand? Don't you see? 

Your rules become stricter and it's suffocating me



I want to break free from the chains that I'm stuck in

But I want you to be proud so I don't give in

I'm never rebellious or bad

Yes I still deserve punishments and I still make you mad.
