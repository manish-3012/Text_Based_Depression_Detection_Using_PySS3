Guys what is this supposed to mean I confessed to my crush not too long ago and he rejected me. Weâ€™re still friends because Iâ€™m not mean. I was telling him about how Iâ€™ve been having a really hard time and could use some support. Then he said â€œfine. Iâ€™ll be your temporary boyfriendâ€ 

Wth does that mean
