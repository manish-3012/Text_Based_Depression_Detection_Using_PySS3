shes gone april 2nd, 2021 3:27 am, my dog roxy took her last breath. she was in so much pain and didnt even have the ability to walk. she went downhill so fast. she is one of the reasons im still here to this day and to see her go is just not something i wish i saw. she had a loss of energy followed by nausea and vomiting, then loss of motor functions and trouble breathing. she was brought into a critical care unit, and they informed us she may not recover. she was one of the most important things in my life and to have her gone just feels so empty. i dont know what to do and im just in shambles. i havent slept hand i cant focus on school. i just feel like im at a loss of emotions
