about to treat my ingrown toenails on both my big toes for the 3rd time in my life, wish me luck I had them both since I was born, but the problem only got worse when I was 13 and needed some treatment. There is no bigger pain than treating ingrown toenails. Giving birth? Cakewalk in comparison. Iâ€™m about to lose my voice screaming in pain. _Adios_
