My dudes I'm having a shitty time So basically I got a gf. But the relationship only lasted like two days because She almost immediately ghosted me. And then I met this other girl who I like and she hasn't been texting me back and I don't wanna say she ghosted me yet but it's starting to feel like it. I mean, I've been ghosted by girls so many times but this time it hurts a lot, because this time I thought I had a Real connection with them. And now the loneliness is setting in. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I thought I had a real connection with them. Am I just being petty. I just want someone to be there for me
