i sometimes hate my younger brother like everytime i want to take a shower he was just 10 seconds faster with saying he was going to take a shower and I'm not lying he uses the bathroom for half a fcking hour sometimes, while I'm done in 10 min. he's also an annoying fck. (my brother is 13)

maybe I'll find him less annoying when we're in a similar fase of life instead of different fases.
