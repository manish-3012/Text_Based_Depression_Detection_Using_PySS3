I never really understood why fat people say men like more chubby and thicc women (there's a difference between thicc and fat btw) Like, i didn't know your entire body image depends and It's backed up on the general male gaze. Which isn't really true, bc most people who say that men like fat women, are actually fat women (ps:i don't mean to offende anyone, its just an observation. Also sorry for bad english)
