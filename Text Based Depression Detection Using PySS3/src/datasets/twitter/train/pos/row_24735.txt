Will I get in trouble if an inappropriate advertisement shows on my school chromebook? My school uses GoGuardian and it allows teachers and admin to see our screens and it automatically records everything that happens on our screens.




I was reading JoJo manga on a manga website using my school chromebook. I usually use Mangadex on my phone but it's blocked on the chromebook.




As I was reading, multiple bondage ads showed on the website. I immediately closed the tab then searched up "holy water". Will I get in trouble for this?
