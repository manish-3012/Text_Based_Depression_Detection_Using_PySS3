Hi again I canâ€™t keep coming back here. Why is this my only way to express how i actually feel. I hate myself. Iâ€™m terribly sad all the time and I fill the void with distractions but every few days I come back here and say the same thing but itâ€™s not the same thing it gets worse every time. I wanna die now more than ever. I actually want to die. Before it was just hypothesis but now itâ€™s real. I want to die. I want it to all be over.

This is how i feel!! I want to die! Iâ€™m finally saying it and it feels great. I want to die
