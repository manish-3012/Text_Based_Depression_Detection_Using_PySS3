Just play the damn game I was just in a game of Among Us and seconds after the game started somebody presses the emergency button. Why? Because they wanted everyone to know that they were a girl. Everyone skipped the vote and when after a couple of seconds she killed someone in front of several people.

I reported the body and after accusing the girl who was CLEARLY the impostor every votes ME off telling me to leave her alone. When I was a ghost every was just happily crowding the girl constantly calling emergencies to decide who should "sacrifice themselves" next.

It really pisses me off when people don't even play the game like they're supposed to just because of someone's gender. Just play the fucking game. What's worse is that the girl even took advantage of it to win the game. This is why I usually play single player games so I don't have to deal with the shitheads in servers like this one.
