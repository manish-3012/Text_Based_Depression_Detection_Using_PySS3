What does it mean if a girl touches your arm? Happened 2 times in 7th grade.

We were standing in a line in the hallway waiting for our teacher to let us in, and as I was standing there this girl I know touched my arm and said hi to me.

Second time it happened was when I was walking to the blacktop and this 8th grade girl pinched my arm and asked me something.

It was odd, O_O.
