My Best Friend Went Missing I hope heâ€™s ok. But his mother barely ever kept track of him whenever heâ€™d go to a friends house. I hope heâ€™s alright, but he was supposed to be here at 8:00 a few days ago, so itâ€™s not looking very good. I just hope heâ€™s at another friends house or something. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments.
