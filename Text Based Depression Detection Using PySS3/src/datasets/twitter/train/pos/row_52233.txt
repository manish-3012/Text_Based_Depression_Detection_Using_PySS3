Raise awarness for r/SuicideWatch I know this isn't what you guys and gals normally see here but I need to raise the awarness for r/SuicideWatch. I found this subreddit and I need more people help us prevent suicides. There are just too many posts to handle so if you can find some love from the bottom of your heart and can take the time too message one person you see there and just talk to them that would mean the world to both them and me. Seeing all the posts about people about to end it all is breaking my heart. Thank you
