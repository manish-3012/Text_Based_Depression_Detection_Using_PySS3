I need some advice I posted this to r/socialskills a few days ago, but I only got one response. Posting it here again to get some more opinions. Here we go:


Hi. I have a friend who I just recently got back in touch with through email when they reached out to me asking if I wanted to talk. We emailed back and forth a couple times, but recently theyâ€™ve been taking several days to respond to emails, they never initiate contact, and if I ask a question like â€œhow have you been doingâ€ they usually just give a short answer and donâ€™t ask me the same question in reply. Am I weird for wishing theyâ€™d put more effort into the friendship? Also what would you ppl do in this situation?
