What are your schools doing for the school year? Mine is doing all distance learning except itâ€™s just our regular school schedule but on zoom. So I get to sit through 7 hours straight of zoom meetings a day plus homework. I donâ€™t like this :) the middle schools only have like 3 hours too. My senior year is going to be the worst :)
