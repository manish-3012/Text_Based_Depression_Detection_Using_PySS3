My parents does not understand the concept of online games. For example, i was playing Valorant, mid match (unrated but still) and my mom came to my room's door and said "go take the trash out and dust your room." i was like "no mom, i am mid game i can't right now, just wait a minute." And she said, JUST PAUSE IT, and she knew it was an online game but she does not understand that i can't pause it bro.
