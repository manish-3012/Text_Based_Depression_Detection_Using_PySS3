Homies, Iâ€™m scared af My friend sent me a screenshot of the website â€œkekma.netâ€ She then sent me another screenshot, a screenshot of some random comment stating â€œBlood everywhere i love itâ€.

I asked her to send me the link since Iâ€™m too lazy to search it up, she told me that the link canâ€™t be sent I said ok and decided to search it up and unexpectedly the results were disturbing. The results were stating that once entered a video of a dog getting skinned will be shown or just anything 100% disturbingly violent stuff so this is a heads up, ok so if youâ€™re gonna ask me why did i enter the website is because Iâ€™m used to seeing gory videos and pictures, my friends or classmates had shown me some disturbingly violent videos trying to make me disgusted in the past year just to challenge me.

As i enter the link some sort of warning was displayed, I ignored it and just went on and as i tapped the screen non-hesitantly pictures of violent shit paired with screaming is suddenly displayed which brought me to be spookâ€™d or surprised 

If some of you are gonna visit the website Iâ€™m gonna warn you again you will be spookâ€™d and probably traumatized and if you did get deeper into the rabbit hole tell or share on what you have seen in the website
