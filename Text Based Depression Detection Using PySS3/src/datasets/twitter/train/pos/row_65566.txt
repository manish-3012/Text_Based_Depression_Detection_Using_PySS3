why do y'all participate in NNN ? am womfan but still a horny, depressed, meme-making teenager, and yet i still do not understand the appeal of NNN. y'all seem so weird to participate in a completely unfacilitated reddit "challenge" like this

so, why ? why do you do it ? is it really just for the funny hahas ? please enlighten me
