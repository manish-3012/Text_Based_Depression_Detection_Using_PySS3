Help (dude/bro) My mom is telling me to take out the trash like always and she always tells me to take it out instead of my sister she never does anything and literally the second I got back she makes me do the dishes and my sister is in her room on her kindle so why canâ€™t I ever have a break like her? Itâ€™s not fair for me
