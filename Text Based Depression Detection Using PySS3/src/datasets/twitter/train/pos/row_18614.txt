my dream was very weird so it started with my sister coming into my room and beating the shit out of me?? so i literally just got up and left with them and my mom chasing me. eventually i found somone else and they brought me to a whole group of people. the whole group started getting clashed by the police but most of them got away. it was cool at first but then it got weird. the group of people took over and had its own government. they would have classes to teach the kids and the older people where the teachers. they were very controlling too. while in class i called my friend and told them i ran away but while that happened i noticed the teacher was talking to them too?? the teacher started descibeing me outloud?? i thought they were looking for me for having a phone so i asked if i could go to the bathroom and hung up the call. outside they were tearing down houses and i accidentally ruined a photograph. the people started chasing me but i got over the â€œborderâ€.  idk what happened next because i woke upðŸ‘


it was also more of a lucid dream so that made it better lol
