I got quarantined today. I dont know who I was in contact with but ive just been pulled from class. I was told this some time in advance so I kept away from everyone to keep them safe. I don't feel sick but it sucked. As i walked out two good friends of mine gave me a salute which at least lightened the mood some.

I personally am not scared yet but I'm more so worried my friends might get quarantined from me. I'm also worried online school will be a pain in the ass to get through. Now I'm just vibing in a small room waiting to get picked up from my brother who I also fear might get sick from me.

Yet another story ill get to tell my future kids of the infamous year 2020.

DAMN IT I JUST REALIZED! Im gonna miss the senior's talk next week in band ;-; im just hoping we can all video call it so me and all the others gone can still try to enjoy it.
