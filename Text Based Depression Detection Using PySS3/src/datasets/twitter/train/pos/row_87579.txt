I don't know what to do. I'm ao done with life. My 2 closest friends now have girls while I'm sitting alone. Whenever I want to do anything with them they don't get back to me. School is causing so much stress for me, there's a girl that I like who probably doesn't even know I exist. I bottle up all of my emotions and they get let out at the wrong moment. I see everybody happy and I want to fall in a hole. There is nothing worth living for and nothing worth dying for. I just don't know what to do anymore.
