idk what to do so i invited this guy round to my house, weâ€™ve been talking about this for a few months now, and he messaged me a few weeks ago asking if i was still down for it. i finally got a time when my parents would be out of the house-wednesday, so i asked him last thursday if he would be available to come then. he seemed to be in a bad mood when i asked and he just said heâ€™d let me know. itâ€™s now monday, what should i do?
