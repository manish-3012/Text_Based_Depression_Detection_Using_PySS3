Please help So as some of you know, I posted a selfie a few days ago. However, the bag I wear on my head got slept on by one of my cats and wrecked it. So, I decided I might do some doodle drawings to compensate for my lack of bag, feel free to comment any help, suggestions, or opinions you have.

(Not very) Fun fact: the bag on my head was made of four bags because the ones I bought were too small..... I need a proper bag for my head ; ~ ;
