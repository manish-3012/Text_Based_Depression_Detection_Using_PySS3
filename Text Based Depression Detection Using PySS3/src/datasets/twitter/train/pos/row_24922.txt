[Personal] Will I get more liked at school if I buy the iPhone 11 pro max? I'm actually waiting for iPhone 12 to come in September/October. So I noticed that everyone that has an iPhone is really popular and I don't know if I should buy it.


I'll rather buy the xiaomi edmi note 10 pro, because it has 5 cameras, a 6.67 inch display, curved display and it has a headphone jack. I always say wow when I see people with an iphone, so can you tell me if I should buy an iPhone or a Xiaomi? It's mainly for gaming tho.


I searched on Google and it said iPhone 11 is the best option for gaming. I also want to have an aEsThEtIc phone soooo which one would be better for me?


Also will I be more popular with the iPhone (I'm going to 10th grade next year and I'm going to buy it then)? If anyone has this phone what are the pros/cons? Is iOS better than Android?
