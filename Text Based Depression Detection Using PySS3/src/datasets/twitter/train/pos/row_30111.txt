Am i the only one overthinking about failing school and what would happen? I am so afraid i will fail this schoolyear because my french sucks and my coding skills too.

Where i go to school there is this one thing: the grade you get will haunt you untill your graduation or untill you failed. This means i cant make a single test bad otherwise i fail. 

Failing means that i am forced to go to a lower level of education and then when I finish that my graduation paper is less worth than the level im doing now, and then i get a shitty paying job and then depression.
