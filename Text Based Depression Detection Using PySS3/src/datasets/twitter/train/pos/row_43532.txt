I hate this about myself Why the fuck am I so terrible at talking to new people? I can't seem to dark because that might make them uncomfortable, and that makes me look bland, and anything I like to talk about, I just ramble on and on.


I just want that one person

That one person who's the same as me in almost every way, and we get along instantly

But as depressing as it is, it's not gonna happen. Not When I'm this unlikable.
