I know its ok to not know but Well i feel like i have to know. Like this isnt the first time ive been in this situation. Last time i chose i was gender fluid because i thought that would give me peace of mind. It didnt. I feel like i have to have a set gender. Im not saying theres only 2 genders cause there arent and ik that. But somewhere in my mind i feel like i have to be one of those 2 genders. I feel like if i dont set myself as one of those 2 genders ill never know who i really am. Again no hate on cisgender, genderfluid, bigender and people that identify as other than male or female. I just feel like i have to be male or female just to know
