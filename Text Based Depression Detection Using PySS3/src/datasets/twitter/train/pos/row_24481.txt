Hey everyone, in need some advice on how to get a girlfriend. Iâ€™ve already asked a couple girls over the years and got denied. Luckily they were kind enough to keep me in the friend zone. I took it pretty well but still, ouch. I just want someone to laugh with and have wholesome moment and I was wondering how to find someone like that.
Please leave your advice below.
