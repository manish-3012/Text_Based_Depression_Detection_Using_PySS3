This is a yikes Well, last night I had a party and I spend the whole time with my crush, till eventually we were watching a movie leaning on each other for hours. I got a text saying â€œI wonâ€™t be able to talk to you as much at schoolâ€ and â€œitâ€™s complicatedâ€. I think her mom, whoâ€™s strict as hell, saw her lock screen of us together and had a talk with her, what do I do?
