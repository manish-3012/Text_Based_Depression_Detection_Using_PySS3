I lost a close friend, and I need to vent Yesterday, I learned that a close friend of mine had passed away in a car accident, and I really don't know what to do. She was only 15. This isn't my first experience with death, my grandfather passed away a few years back, but I didn't know him well and I was younger. But now I'll scroll through my phone, and see her name, and I just break down. I just talked to her last week, about how she was doing, asked her about her day. And now she's just gone, just like that. She's all I can think about, everything else just concern me anymore. Normally a day of grinding Assassin's Creed and playing guitar is a great day for me, but I'm just not interested in those things now, they don't make me happy. I just feel sick and don't have much of an appetite. I just miss her so much
