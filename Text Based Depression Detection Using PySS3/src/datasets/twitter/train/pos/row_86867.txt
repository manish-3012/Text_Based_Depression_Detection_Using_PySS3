Im not a trans who gets triggered and offended by shit, like you can literally call me a tr**ny and rly idgaf. But just saying, I don't think it's transphobic to not want to date a trans person but you're still a piece of shit if you talk to a cute girl and ditch her after u learn she's trans. Text so automod doesn't remove the post
