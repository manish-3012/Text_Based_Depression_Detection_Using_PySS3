To compare or not to compare 17F. My parents are always comparing me to my sisters, asking why I can't be more like them, comparing their achievements to mine, etc. But whenever I try to bring up how they treat me differently from my sisters (they're always more willing to spend money on my sisters than me, my little sister 16F, has an iPad and a better phone that my parents bought while I have a crappy $67 phone I had to buy myself, I'm expected to do my sister's chores whenever it's inconvenient for her but they'll wake me up if I haven't done mine, I've been running XC for three years and they won't buy me new running shoes even though the ones I've had for three years hurt my feet, but my sister started XC this year and they bought her $200 running shoes, and they buy her $200 basketball shoes every year, my little sister got a debit card before me even though she's never had a job and I've had three, my mom insists on keeping my money for 'safe-keeping' but they let my little sister buy anything she wants and will often chip in, and I always get my older sister's hand-me-downs while they both get new clothes every year) they say I compare myself to them too much. Talk about a double standard. I already feel like the black sheep of the family and I'm scared that when I come out they're gonna go NC with me. I was looking forward to going to college and finally living my own life but now there's a chance I won't be on a campus next fall due to the pandemic and I don't know what I'll do if that happens. Probably cry. Anyway, rant over. Thank you to those who made it this far.
