Help me I have boy problems This is such a teenager moment lol. In The past three day two different boys asked me to be there gf. Now I have to pick between them. Each one have what the other one doesnâ€™t. (Sorry this post is dumb)

Boy one

Funny, I can talk to him for hours, he opens up to me etc. but Iâ€™m not physically Attracted to him at all. And it would feel super awkward if we tried anything like sexual. He also live half way across the world. 

Boy two

Very sweet and understand, gentle and patient but he wonâ€™t really open up to me and heâ€™s a little bit boring sometimes. But Iâ€™m very physically and romantically attracted to him. He also lives closer
