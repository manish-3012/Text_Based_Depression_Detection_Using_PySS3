i told a kid to pull his mask up and he coughed all over me (sorry for bad grammar i dont care right now) god i hate my school so much it's just a bunch of homophobes and stupid antimaskers. most of them think the masks don't even do anything and they just walk around with their masks down breathing out their nasty germs all over everybody. i want to change schools so bad and move. i live in the a super conservative place and as a lgbt teen living here it sucks so bad and i hate it here. fgydudnfgryufngrjehgw i mean i do know a few supportive people here but it's hard to be in contact with them because none of my friends KNOW HOW TO TEXT I MEAN IS IT SO HARD TO REPLY AT ALLLL I SWEAR. anyways i just had to rant somewhere because nobody i know talks to me so there.
