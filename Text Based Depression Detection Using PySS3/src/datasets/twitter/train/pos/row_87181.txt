u come back home from a tiring and stressful day at work/school and u get home n instantly get a warm welcome hug from ur bf/gf. They ask u what you wanna do now. U say ur tired and lay down on the couch. Minutes later ur bf/gf lays next to u and offers u their stomach as a pillow. U ofcourse accept that offer and lay urself on their body. Their warmth makes u feel comfy and safe, making u sleepier and sleepier by the minute

As u close ur eyes yet again and feel how ur bf/gf embraces u tightly before u finally drift to sleep with a smile on ur face

when suddenly u hear a ringing. The ringing gets more and more intense until it finally rips u away from ur dreams. U wake up to ur alarm clock, look around in ur dark and messy room. Soon u realize that this was all just a dream and the crippling loneliness starts to strike u

with a heavy tear rolling down ur face and the crippling depression eating u up from inside, u force urself up to get ready and attend another, boring day at work/school. U spend the following day daydreaming this scenarion over and over again, enhancing it with every replay and not paying attention to anything else, until u break down during the day and receive a spark of commitment to fix ur life, which shortly after gets put out by a small inconvinience throughout the day

you get back home, lie down on ur bed without doing any homework or learning for anything prior to the next day. So u just melt into ur bed and wait until u can access ur dreams again so u can feel atleast a little better about urself and ur horrid and pathetic way of life. 

"What a sad piece of doodoo i am." u think to urself before drifting away to ur happy place
