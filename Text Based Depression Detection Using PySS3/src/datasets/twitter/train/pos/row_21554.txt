hi i'ma useless guy with a religious study degree here to tell you it is not big sin to be gay in some cases. I will be using quit the informal language.

i have had people ask me and mainly teenagers like you guy, that, is it a sin to be gay. So before i begin i just want to make clear that the fact that "people" say that it is a sin but not god. On basis of Christianity it is not a sin at all, there were approximately 470 Bibles written from with the first one that is mentioned in Muslim history and the Quran as well as the books of Jews and Jewish history including the Hindu Vedas says that being homosexual "and" homophobic is a sin. It is said that being homosexual is upon the persons own choice and it is between them and god, but if a person reveals or criticises this decision are sinners and shall be punished by the grace of god.

In Hinduism it is a complete sin, no repercussions at all, you are to be burned alive if you are found guilty for being homosexual. this will also cause your rebirth cycle to stop. Same is with Buddism

In the Quran for the Muslims it said to be a sin but if a person is homosexual it is said to keep it between you and god, if you are to get married in a homosexual marriage, you shall consent your parents but if they disapprove you shall not and if they support you, you shall proceed with the marriage. But it is a sin no matter what, you shall be punished in the afterlife and you're grave if are homosexual as it may be a sign that you have strayed further from god and his grace and ignored his teachings. Same is with the jews
