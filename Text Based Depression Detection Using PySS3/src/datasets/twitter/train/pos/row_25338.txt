I honestly don't know how to feel So I had a delivery order that was just 20$ and 75 cents and in this order i choose to pay when it comes to me not before, so when the guy showed up I gave him 25 dollars and told him to keep the rest, and he said "are you serious?" Andi said yes so he thanked me sincerely, I don't know if I should feel happy I made him glad or feel sad a 5 dollar trip on a 20 dollar order seemed like much to him
