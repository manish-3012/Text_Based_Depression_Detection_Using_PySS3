Well boys I have good news and bad news Good news is that after some odd 4 years after my old PC decided it shouldn't live anymore, I finally got a new one. It's nothing fancy like my old one, but it was all we could afford. Bad news is that I don't have access to the email I had my Steam account under, and I don't have a clue on any of my other information. I tried getting it back but no use. RIP my cool shit
