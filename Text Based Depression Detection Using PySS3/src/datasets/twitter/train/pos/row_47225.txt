Sorry guys I failed the November challenge 
This morning when I woke up the first thing I did was rush to the bathroom and got undressed and got ready with the lotion and stuff...... and I FREAKIN SHAVED MY FACIAL HAIR thatâ€™s it I lost the No Shave November challenge.

But Iâ€™m still a brave solider fighting in the No Nut November challenge, DAY 2 LETS GOOOO BABY!!!
