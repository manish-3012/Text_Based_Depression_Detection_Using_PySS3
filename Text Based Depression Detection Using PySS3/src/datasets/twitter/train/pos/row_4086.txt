This is the first year I have to be responsible and it fucking sucks Now thatâ€™s Iâ€™m old enough, I have a job. That on top of school, family, friends and trying to find time for myself is the most stressful time of my life. Itâ€™s always someone bitching if I donâ€™t pay attention to them when I have other things that I need to be focusing on. No matter what, someoneâ€™s always unhappy with me about something. My respect for adults has gone up drastically. This shit sucks guys :(
