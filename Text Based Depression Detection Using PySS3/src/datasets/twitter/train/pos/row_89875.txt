Please Help Me With My Trust Issues Hi, teenagers from all over the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a male, 16 years old, I'm from Czech Republic and I have huge trust issues.

I've been in a lot of relationships, which mostly end by me getting cheated on. That is where my trust issues mostly develop. At the moment, I am in a relationship with a wonderful girl. She is different than the other girls, I've dated in the past. She is much sweeter, she wants cuddles and hugs and overall I am able to put all my love between us. We've been dating for around a month now and I still can't come around my trust issues.

Anytime she would say, she is going out with her friend (female), for some reason I think, she is out with some other guy, even though I know, that is not the truth..

I feel like a dick and like I don't deserve her.. 

I want to be able to put all of my trust into her, unfortunately I can't. 

Something is really wrong with me and I want to get rid of that.

Can someone please give me any advice, to come around my trust issues?
