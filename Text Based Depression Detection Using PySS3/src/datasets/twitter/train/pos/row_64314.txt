I keep having nightmares (Trigger Warning) Nightmare 1: I have stitches along my belly, and they hurt. They would open every time I needed to reach up, making me bleed out. 

Nightmare 2: Iâ€™m trapped in someoneâ€™s house. I try sneaking through these secret passageways. But they find us, and they take my baby away. Then they try to kill me by cutting me apart and open. 

Nightmare 3: Iâ€™m pregnant, like big big pregnant. I go to the hospital to get a c-section. Instead they tie me down while they cut me open, and this strange guy comes in to steal my baby. Once again, leaving me to bleed out. 

I donâ€™t know why they all have to do with my belly or a baby, I really donâ€™t. But they felt very real for the moment and Iâ€™d wake up with stomach pain.
