I'm so fucking pissed I might delete my acc (vent) So you know yesterday how I posted how people on r/iPhoneX thought I stole my grandma's phone because I dont have the apple id, nor her (or someones email whoever set it up) email or the pin. Well I'm being accused of it again and people are calling me a liar and trying to pick out little mistakes in my text post. You know, I thought snobby apple users was just hyperbole, but no, when you need help the most they accuse you of theft because their phones are secured like Fort Knox. Dont have any identification? Boom you're a thief. Fuck you you rich snobby assholes with phones like glass, I hope the ghost of my grandma haunts you until the end of your days.
