how destructive can benders from avatar the last airbender get? water benders can fuck up things quite bad with bloodbending and all those other cool stuff

but could earthbenders technically cause nuclear explosions?

could firebenders just burn everything and cause air to be toxic

could airbenders just create massive explosions by compacting air into  a small enough area or by creating a perfect vacuum

how destructive can they get?
