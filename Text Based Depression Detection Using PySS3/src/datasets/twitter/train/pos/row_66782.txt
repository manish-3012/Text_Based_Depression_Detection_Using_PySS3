Girls in my school are trying to figure out which guy has biggest snake in the year (15/16yo)

The â€œcool girlsâ€ in my school are actively touching guys up during class to figure out who has the biggest anaconda

Iâ€™m thinking about stuffing my underwear with something long and hard to throw them off.

This is not a joke. Iâ€™m being serious.
Yes itâ€™s sexual harassment but every guy is turning a blind eye because well, girls.
