does saying the nword when ur white make u racist or a shitty person i was just having this conversation w someone and IMO u can say it and not be racist. Like donâ€™t get me wrong saying it and not being black is offensive and really really fucking wrong. But it doesnâ€™t automatically make someone racist, it just makes them a shitty person
