Twitter is annoying I'm not talking about the people, I mean the platform. I'm a BatIM Fanartist (Bendy and the Ink Machine) and the BatIM art community is actually super nice. But earlier I made a mistake. I drew a digital drawing, tweeted it, then decided to set it as my profile picture. Then I noticed the birthday option...

The only warning said that you can only change the birthday a few times, so I did. Then it locked my account, saying only users 13 or older can use the platform. I'm already 13, almost 14, so I'd figured it would still let me use the account, but no, apparently Twitter's calculator broke. Now I have to wait for Mom to get home so I can unlock it again.
