My family keeps pissing me off So in my household, we speak English and Spanish, my siblings and I speak english amongst each other and we speak in spanish to our mom. Everytime we get into a discussion, I speak in English regardless of who I'm talking to because it's easier for me to prove a point since I speak english better than spanish. Everyone in my family constantly makes fun of me even when I tell them to stop, but if I say something about someone saying a word wrong I get yelled at. It's constantly happening and it pisses me off. I know nobody is gonna see this but it feels nice to rant somewhere.
