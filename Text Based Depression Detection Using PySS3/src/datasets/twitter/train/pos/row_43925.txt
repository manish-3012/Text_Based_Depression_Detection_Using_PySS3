What do red roses mean? So, first things first. As I am quite an introvert, I never was able to grasp many social 'conventions'.

About 2 years ago, when I was throwing a party for my 16th birthday (nothing big, I always only invite a handful of friends, we go on some activity (this time it was an escape room) and then we'll return for games, gifts and cake) a friend, a very good friend that I knew since I was 11 or 12, who happens to be a girl, gifted me a single red rose. The 'main' present was also great, it was a 30â‚¬ gift card for a comic book store if I remember correctly. 

Because the internet gave me conflicting answers, I never knew what that meant. And I sure as hell was not going to ask anybody about that. Until yesterday. I asked my mom, who told me that the meaning of a rose depends on its color. A white rose means apology, a pink rose means friendship and a red rose means love. 

I was baffled. If that's really true, I was missing signs that a smart, funny and ngl quite good looking girl was hitting on me. As I havn't been in a lot of relationships it wouldn't surprise me to be oblivious in the ways of love. 

A few months before my birthday, however, she switched schools and the introvert that I am, we lost contact at some point.

I am still confused and a little angry about myself. I feel dumb and I thought that I might as well ask Reddit. I don't know whether I should go and try to get to the bottom of this, or whether I am overthinking this.

Oh yeah, I should ask a question at this point. It's basically the question in the title.
