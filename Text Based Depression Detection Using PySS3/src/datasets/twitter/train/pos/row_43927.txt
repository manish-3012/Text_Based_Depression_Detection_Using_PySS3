I know most of you can relate Donâ€™t you hate when one of your parents asks you to help them with some tech problem. So you go to help them at the computer or whatever and then there all like â€œno no I got itâ€ while doing something to make it worse. So you try to guide them by showing them what to do and they throw out the classic â€œim the adult which means I know what Iâ€™m doingâ€ No you donâ€™t. It could be so much easier if I help. You get the problem fixed. You donâ€™t need to argue and I can go back to whatever I was doing. More importantly donâ€™t say that you know what to do because your an adult. You may have more life experience because your older but that doesnâ€™t mean you know how to do everything. No one truly has there life together. We all have some shit thatâ€™s not together and if you donâ€™t then you soon will. So just let me help.

Tl:Dr: your not a almighty god because your older
