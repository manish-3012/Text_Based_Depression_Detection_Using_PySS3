I need advice on this poem i wrote. # Raindrops

Tears and rain interlace as one.

It was you and me, but now youâ€™re gone.

I remember our times sitting in the rain.

Trying to cry away the pain.

Do you still think of me, as i you?

Is my feelings a lie, or just a twisted truth?

Puddles patter in the rain.

Childrenâ€™s laughter is the same.

Busy chatter in cafeâ€™s.

While streams of tears fall off my face.

Nobody will notice my tears, because my face is already stained.

My soul is the cloud, protecting myself from help that has never came.

I wish youâ€™d return, for a final good bye.

But i am just a man. Watching as the clouds cry.
