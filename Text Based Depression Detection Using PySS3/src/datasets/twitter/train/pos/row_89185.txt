My friend made a big mistake the other day He asked me, â€œWhat is Hololive?â€

Context: I think this was a little over a week ago, but I told my friends I was gonna watch an unarchived live stream so I couldnâ€™t hang out with the boys in discord. One of my friends asked what stream I was gonna watch. I kept trying to say thatâ€™s itâ€™s just a stream that I needed to watch but he just kept asking. So I just said  that it was a singing stream from a vtuber I watch. He just asked me a quick question before I went to go watch the stream on which was â€œvtubers are those anime girls right?â€ I just said yeah and he told me that I had my priorities straight.

Fast forward to a few days ago, he asked me â€œWhat is Hololive?â€ Apparently he went and searched up a little more about vtubers ever since that day and found out about Hololive. And so, I brought him into the vtuber rabbit hole with me.

I just kinda wanted to share this cuz it felt great to show someone else about the things that I watch. The stream was Gawr Guraâ€™s unarchived singing live stream for those who were wondering.
