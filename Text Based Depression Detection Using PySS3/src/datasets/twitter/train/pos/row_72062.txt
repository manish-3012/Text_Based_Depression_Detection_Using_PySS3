Time to say goodbye I am not turning 20. I am 17yo student. This year I am taking my final exams. They will help me achive my goals but also will require much dedication and self discipline, so I started abolishing time consumming activities. I would like to thank you for all the time being, you made it special for me. I felt here safe to be and express myself, which isn't common on reddit or other social media. But my journey is yet to come. And it is gonna be a long road. Long and lonely. I am not sure who will return from it. I highly doubt I shall return but I felt a need to say goodbye. And thank You.
