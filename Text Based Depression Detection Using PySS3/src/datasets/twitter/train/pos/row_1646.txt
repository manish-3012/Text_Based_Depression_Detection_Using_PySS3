Todays my birthday and none of my friends said happy birthday to me :\ I know im probably over reacting but today's my birthday and at 1:00AM i was staring at my phone waiting for the messages and its 2:00 PM and the only ones that said happy birthday are my fam :\\  
I know im probably entitled AF but i remember all of my friends birthdays and i always FaceTime them idk it low key hurt. i put the flare as a rant but idk i just needed to kind of say it
