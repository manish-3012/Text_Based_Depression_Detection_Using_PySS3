my parents make me mad I got my license the 19th of August. the 21st, my mom asked me to drive my older brother (hes 24 and doesnt have his license) to McDonald's. it was like 8 pm. I'm not really supposed to be out that late so she had to drive him. 

now, I'm not allowed to take her car anywhere until I have more practice, but I'm not allowed to drive. if my older brother finds out I've been driving he'll throw a tantrum. she doesnt get off until 6 pm. I cant drive my dads trail blazer because he doesnt trust it (it broke down not to long ago and it's not the best). 

my mom doesnt want to go anywhere when shes off. my sister told her 6 year old daughter, I can drive her to her sisters dads house. I was given permission by her mother. I asked my mom about it. she said "you cant drive her by yourself." her reasoning? "bc I said so."

so now its seeming like the only reason I got my license was to tote my older brother around. I've driven without adults before. I'm not a bad driver. 

this is why I dont like my parents 90% of the time. they favor my older brat of a brother, then restrict what my younger brother and i do bc of him.
