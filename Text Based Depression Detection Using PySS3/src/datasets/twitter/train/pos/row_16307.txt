What The fuck is going on with this Sub? Right now I am trying to post a picture of a sign because that guy with the Burger King sign inspired me to, 

But for some fucking reason, I canâ€™t post a picture of it, it just says â€œthis subreddit doesnâ€™t support picturesâ€ so I tried to post a video of it, but the same god damn thing happens â€œthis subreddit doesnâ€™t support videoâ€. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on because in the past, I posted pictures and videos just fine before, but why not now?

Anyways any solutions? This is fucking stupid
Thank you for reading


Edit: SENCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN THAT WE CANT POST PICTURES ON THE FUCKING WEEKEND? THAT MAKES NO SENSE
