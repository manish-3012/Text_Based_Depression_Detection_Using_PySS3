I Donâ€™t Know What to Do My best friend is really mad at me rn and she keeps throwing all these reasons and things at me. The thing is Iâ€™m actually really mad at her too and even have some reasons that refute some of hers. However, if I say anything deeper about myself than my favorite food or express and emotion more extreme then bummed out I get tremors and start shaking which hurts and usually causes me to stutter. She does not know this (goes to show her emotional understanding of me and what I think) which is not her fault. She has some mental issue problems too and she shares basically everything with me so I know most everything about her. I am the world master of hiding my problems so she assumes I have none. Hashtag trust issues so bad I donâ€™t even trust anyone to tell them I got trust issues. Either way we are basically in a fight and I have no idea how to tell her how I feel about about it and it makes me worried it will never get resolved.
