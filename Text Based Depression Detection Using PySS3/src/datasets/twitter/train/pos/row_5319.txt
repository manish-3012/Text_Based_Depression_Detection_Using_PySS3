Day 30 of posting my favorite bit of lyrics from a song on my Spotify playlist. "I've lived in my room for the past three years, and I'm not sure if you have even noticed. And I can't wait to spend my days, making zines in the living room, or sleeping in the middle of the hallway. Or sitting criss-cross, eating on the kitchen floor, or doing my own dishes, not yours." Criss Cross (On The Kitchen Floor) by Human Petting Zoo
