A question for the boys of this sub Do you actually just...jerk off to everyone? Like, I get it if they post provocatively, but even just normal selfies? Thatâ€™s uh, kinda nasty. 

Actually, Iâ€™m pretty sure all guys are just disgusting when it comes to horny. I was in a group chat with a bunch of guys last year and it was just vile.

But please, prove me wrong. Do all guys do this?
