I feel like my boyfriend doesnâ€™t want to be with me. My boyfriend and Iâ€™s two months is tomorrow, and we havenâ€™t hung out once. 
In the beginning everything was so good, he acted so happy, he talked all the time. Now recently he maybe talks to me 4 times and thats it. I dont know if heâ€™s sleeping or not because he never tells me. Go goodnight or anything. 
I always ask when we should plan something but its like â€œoh im really busyâ€. 
Hes either working or at his friends house smoking or buying. 
I feel like heâ€™s embarrassed to be around me, I feel like its my fault. 

One time I brought up that he never talked to me and he got mad and offended. I just dont know what to do :/
