if you were my real friend youâ€™d listen to me and tell me that itâ€™s okay to dislike people and that my opinions on others are valid (if they have hurt me) 

you would be happy to talk to me on the phone especially when iâ€™m stressed 

and most importantly, you wouldnâ€™t just cancel plans on me last minute. TWICE.
