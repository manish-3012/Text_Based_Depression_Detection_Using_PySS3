Is it suicidal if I wish I never existed ? I don't want to die  but I feel that it would have been a lot better if I never existed in the first place. 
I wish that I was never born . Is it suicidal to think this?

P.S I don't know the correct place ( subreddit ) to ask this , so forgive if this doesn't belong here .
