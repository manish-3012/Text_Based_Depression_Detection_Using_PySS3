Someone at my school had a breakdown from it From the assignments and hw overload and test overloads. Itâ€™s crazy in my school; one day virtual and then the next day a test/assignment is due in school.

Winter break is like in two weeks, luckily no exams for now.

but still the overload is too much.

Howâ€™s things looking at ur side?
