i have syntenesia and am wondering if anyone else has it too  (syntenesia is a disorder which makes you litteraly smell somehing when you hear a word, or just automatically makes you relate a word to a colour/ picture) i have the smelling type, and not every word has a smell but i get new ones, like for example i hear crust and i smell fried chicken 1 out of like 5 times i hear it.

2 months ago when i watched a vudeo about syntenesia i realized that i have it , and i was completely unaware that other people couldn't smell some words.


One of the worst smells i have is co2, cabbage , and poop smell in one, the word is "gregoris" (gregory in english) it was the name of my cabbage butterly caterpillar that i had been growing a while ago, almost every time when i think of the word/hear/say it i smell the co2 cabbagy smell.
i smelled cabbages because he ate cabbages and every morning that i cleaned his jar i smelled the c02 from his poops, and the funky cabbage smell.

if you got this far, thanks for reading about my shitty superpower
