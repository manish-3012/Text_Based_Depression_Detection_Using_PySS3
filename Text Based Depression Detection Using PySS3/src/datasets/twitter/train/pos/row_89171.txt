My mom believes that masks don't work She just tells me this without backing it up with evidence, except for the "fact" that if you can smell a fart through someone's jeans, then you can catch a disease through someone's mask. She never went to college, and I've been taking college classes since my junior year of high school. I'm 17 and I have to live with this person for who knows how many more years. Somebody please prove her wrong.
