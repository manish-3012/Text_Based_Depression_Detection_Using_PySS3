So my new phone got stolen (This happened a few weeks ago) 

So my old phone was pretty old and slow, so my father decided to buy a new phone from amazon. We ordered the phone (a samsung galaxy M31, because it was pretty cheap) on monday and it said that it'll arive on wednesday. So we waited and waited and it didn't arive, the next day same thing. Friday I went to the dentist and while I wasn't at home it apparently arived, but it felt too lightweighted, so we opened it and the phone wasn't there. My father called the customer service and they said they'll  send a new one and they'll  investigate it. This time it arived and we haven't heard anything ever since.
