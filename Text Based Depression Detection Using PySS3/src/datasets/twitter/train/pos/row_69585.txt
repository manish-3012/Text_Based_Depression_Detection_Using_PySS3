My parents lost "all confidence" on me after I bought some headphones I just bought some damn headphones and they got extremely upset at me cuz I broke 3 rules that "oh you went to a mall, you lied to us, you didn't ask for our permission, you spend money on something I was going to buy you etc". Ok wow do you really have to be so upset? I've been asking since February 2019 for a damn bracelet for my watch and you didn't even listen, I wasn't going to let this happen again, but oh no I got the matter into my own hands and oh well guess who fucked up? Geez at least I walked but oh no guess you're still gonna be calling me fat. Better yet, I've only been acting like this cuz you changed me into this school, without even asking for my permission, and making me lose my friends. I'm sorry I was let with this garbage you left me with that I call friends... God fucking damn it, they were headphones... Call me too dependent and sedentary, but when I finally do it I get this reaction? Ok then, guess I'm gonna be a lonely nerd for now on, it's the only way you like it. All that matters are grades so fuck what you want to do... Fuck 2020, I'm done with it
