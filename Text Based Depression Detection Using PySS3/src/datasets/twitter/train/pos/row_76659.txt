Good knowing ya- This sub reddit used to be great! Nice wholesome fun and whatever, good times all around. But recently, I've noticed that it's slowly getting worse. The quality is degrading as more incels/p*dophiles come out of no where. So I'm leaving and I really doubt I'm coming back. So thank you to everyone who made me smile, or helped me get through a tough time. I can't take how toxic it's getting, so bye. â™¥ï¸
