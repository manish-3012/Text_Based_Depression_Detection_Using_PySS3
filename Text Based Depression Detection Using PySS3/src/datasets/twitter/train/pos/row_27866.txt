Man I'm pretty sure I'm not depressed, but I'm hella sad rn First off, I don't care if my reasons are justified or even logical, cus they're probably all in my head anyway, but either way I still feel bad so...I guess I'll start off with I have been adding random people on my quick add list on snapchat for the past few days. I must've added 50 people who go to my highschpol whom I don't know. Very few have responded and I'm really just looking for someone new to talk to in a not awkward way. I'm pretty awkward talking to people. Just shit I say. I also have trouble exhibiting interest and figuring out wtf people talk about not awkwardly. And if I'm being really honest with myself, I'm tryna find a good looking chick to talk to too. Haven't found any even though there's a lot on the list, but I'm nervous talking to any of them cus I'm not attractive and it's just an odd thing to be dong anyway. Also, there's this girl from one of my classes, she's a freshmen, and I think she's a babe and I'd like to talk to her and I followed her on Instagram like an hour ago and I'm wondering if she'd even be interested in talking. I've heard her talk in class too and I think she might be a h*e. But apparently I'm into girls like that because of my bad taste and the fact that every girl I've ever liked turned out to be one. Really just need someone to listen rn. I feel like crap about everything all the time especially when I think too hard and too long about everything in my life.
