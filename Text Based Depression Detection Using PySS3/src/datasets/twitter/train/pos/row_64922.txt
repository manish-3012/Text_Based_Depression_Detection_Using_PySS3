Idk about you guys, but you know what is really attractive? A girl that is passionate about a hobby or activity. Like, who gives a fuck about cups or donkeys, teach me to knit, take me on hike, or crush me in a card game. Nothing is more of a instant bore than a girl who lacks substance, personality or individuality.

Donâ€™t care if it is basic girly stuff like boy bands or cheerleading or as out there like weightlifting and Magic: The Gathering. Just something you can lecture me about and share your love of it with me.
