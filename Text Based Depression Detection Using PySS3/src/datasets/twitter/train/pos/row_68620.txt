What am I supposed to do/say to this friend? We're close but he barely keeps in touch with me and it takes him days and weeks to respond to my texts. A few weeks ago we were facetiming and all of a sudden he seemed really pissed off and ended the call without notice. Nothing even happened. Literally nothing. I asked him if he was okay and it took him weeks to respond and say that he's okay. This has been going on for quite a while and I don't know what to do.
