Itâ€™s been a year Been on reddit for a year now so Iâ€™m going over my checklist:
Have I been happier? Probably not
Have I become more interesting? Nah
Am I more original now? Definitely not
Do I hate tik tok? Yes
Is this an original idea? I donâ€™t think so
Do I have crippling depression? No but I have to fake it
Has my taste in memes improved? You can bet on it
Do i constantly tell my friends about how Iâ€™m on reddit and how that makes me better than them? Yes

Oh and now I dream in memes
