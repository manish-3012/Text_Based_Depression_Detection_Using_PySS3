Finally finished moving! So for 2 months me and my family have been planning to move away from my small town in NC too florida. After some intense packing we've managed to get to one of my family friends houses and live about 30-40 minutes away from tampa. Also before everyone mentions it, yes we understand the covid issue. Once we left any rest stops we made we wore masks and we gonna wait a week before we do anything too quarantine (which gives us time to settle in). Currently my only complaint is going from 2,036 feet above sea level and average of 50*F to 4 feet above sea level and average of 70-85*F. Anyway hope y'all read this.
