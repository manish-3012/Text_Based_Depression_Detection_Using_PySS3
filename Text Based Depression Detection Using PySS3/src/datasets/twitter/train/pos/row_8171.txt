I donâ€™t care who you are and what you believe you shouldnâ€™t wish death on anyone I was on twitter and the amount of death wishes on the president, his wife, and other politicians/candidates is insane. I understand theyâ€™ve made bad decisions and you may not like them but death is completely unreasonable. There is no coming back from it they are gone forever and their families are forever in sadness and grief. That is an amount of evil I canâ€™t condone. We gotta appreciate life and the lives of everyone even if we donâ€™t like them much.
