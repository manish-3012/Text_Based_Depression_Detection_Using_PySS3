I found a pretty big huntsman spider in my bathroom ceiling but I couldnâ€™t reach it and was lazy and now Iâ€™m anxious It wasnâ€™t that big (1.5x1.8in?), but thatâ€™s significant where I live. It walked from
The top of the wall to the bottom of the ceiling, but for some stupid reason we have 9 foot ceilings so yeah Iâ€™m not even afraid of spiders but I donâ€™t like this one. 

Edit: about to post and my hand felt a small itch and went into a spasm. I think Iâ€™m not gonna sleep well tonight.
