I thought liberals were the anti conformity and anti follow the rules type people. But theyâ€™re the type of people to elegy mad at someone for saying a word and then scream at someone for not wearing a mask. Like, Iâ€™m pretty sure republicans are the anti conformists in todayâ€™s society. Green Dayâ€™s â€œAmerican idiotâ€ was made about republicans but now fits perfectly to liberals.
