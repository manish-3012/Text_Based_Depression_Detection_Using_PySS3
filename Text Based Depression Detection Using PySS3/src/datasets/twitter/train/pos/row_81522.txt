What are your thoughts on Rebuilding Cars? I think it whould be a fun passtime thing.


Let's say it's the summer Break of 2023, you've got nothing to do, when all of a sudden, you're Dad comes to you and says he wants to rebuild a 1969 Ford Mustang GT. You agree, pick it up and rebuild it, as promised.

That's what I mean. Give me your thoughts on this Topic.
