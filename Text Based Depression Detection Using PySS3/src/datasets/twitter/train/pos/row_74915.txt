I feel like my heads going to explode. Its saturday,but i have so many problems. This is much more stressful than the face 2 face class. Im getting scared,i feel like im going to have a mental breakdown,i got paired up to a group with smart people and now I am being stressed. I have so many deadlines,i just want to rant and want sometone to comfort me. I feel like I just wanna die,people mentioning my name saying I need to pass 2 pictures and not 1 but ive already run out of ideas,im sorry but im not as smart as you. Jesus christ,im too tired. I feel like commiting suicide by just one simple project.
