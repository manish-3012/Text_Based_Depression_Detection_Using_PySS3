So my baby lizard just fucking pooped on me. I was trying to chill with my baby bearded dragon in which I named â€œWalterâ€ and my man fucking squatted on me and plopped a can of â€œfuck youâ€ on my trousers. Bro clenched his teeth and released all of last weeks stress on my YMCA T-shirt, now itâ€™s a T-Shit. That shit smelled like dookie, and it WAS dookie. Bro needs to learn that the doo stays in the lou, or cage at least. I cleaned it up with disinfectant spray and Iâ€™m not gonna wear my YMCrap shirt for weeks.
