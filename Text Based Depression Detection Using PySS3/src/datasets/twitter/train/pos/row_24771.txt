so No Shave November is over, how's the first week of Don't Wipe December going? I gotta say, I'm really not enjoying Don't Wipe December as much as No Shave November.  No Shave was actually kind of fun, but Don't Wipe just feels different I guess. Also I'm sorta getting crusty.

What has been your experience with Don't Wipe December so far?
