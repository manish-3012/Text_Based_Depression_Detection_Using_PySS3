This is random, but notes are nice School sucks, sure, but the most satisfying thing to do is take well formatted notes. Itâ€™s satisfying and pays off when studying. 

Everything is labeled, numbered, and color coded. I have an index and list of vocab at the beginning of all notebooks. Usually black pen for titles and subheadings, blue for notes, and red for explanations an examples. Make extra diagrams/charts too. 

Going back through your notes you thank your past self, and feel somewhat proud of your work. Itâ€™s just pleasing to look at, idk why. If I mess up a page I have to rip it out and redo it. Itâ€™s a strange habit I have, and if theyâ€™re not perfect I must redo them. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t just â€œtake notesâ€ and I jot down points, go home, then format everything in a notebook. 

Anyone else?
