Hey lads, Iâ€™m back with the final â€œbeating my masturbation addictionâ€ update. Sorry it was so late, I got a 3 day suspension from Reddit for making a damn pedo joke over in r/memes. Some people really canâ€™t handle dark humor. Anyway I was curious, to celebrate me going a month, and possibly more if Iâ€™m able, without masturbating, would you guys like me to post a picture of myself? If I do, Iâ€™ll be wearing a face mask since Iâ€™m not comfortable with posting my full face.

Iâ€™ll let this post marinate for a day, and if the general consensus is yes, then Iâ€™ll go for it tomorrow. Oh, and thanks for all the support. Even though my posts never really get much attention, itâ€™s good to know people are supportive.
