An interesting relationship So in 8th grade me and a girl started talking over text. When school came back from summer I tried to talk to her but she would speak back. We still talked over text and everything but when we were in person she just wouldnâ€™t talk. I knew she could she was just awkward I guess. Idk why I didnâ€™t break up with her. One day when we were texting she told me about a guy she met. I guess later she accidentally told me that she was played by him. I totally forgot they just met. But in person I just stopped trying to talk to her and I just hopped she would break up with me. She would get mad at me for not talking to her and I just let it be. Everyone in school was like why donâ€™t you talk to her and all that. Eventually I broke up with her and that was that. One day on her Instagram she posted something that was like a bingo board. Idrk what it was but on it is said I had cheated on someone. Then I realized that I was her first relationship and I was the one that she cheated on. It stung a little but I guess all Iâ€™m trying to say is be aware. Donâ€™t open up to people you just met. Spare your feelings for the future and if they wonâ€™t speak to you just break up. 
Hope this helps some of you out there that donâ€™t know what to do.
