So I just bought condoms... I thought there was this whole thing about sizing and then purchasing but bc my family would of course not want me getting them I got some at wawa.


So I just walk from my house to the wawa right and there just there in these small ass boxes.


Thereâ€™s tons of people going in and out but I had the balls to just pick them up and inspect the box (Iâ€™m 16 so I bet I got some weird faces that I just didnâ€™t care to notice) but there werenâ€™t fucking size recommendations!


So I just took one and the most awkward part is checkout. Iâ€™m just sitting there and thereâ€™s a middle aged woman behind me and the guy whoâ€™s checking me out takes the longest time to put them in the fucking bag. 


But after that I leave with confidence cause I just got outta that really awkward time. 


But I have no clue how they work or if theyâ€™ll even fit me but hey if they donâ€™t work Iâ€™ll just either give them to a friend or have some interesting balloons
