I woke up one day with back pain when breathing. Iâ€™m devastated to find out that me (12M) yes, Iâ€™m 12 on here but hear me out: I might just have simple strained muscle, or I could have something WAY worse. Iâ€™m scared. Itâ€™s 5:22 AM and I donâ€™t know if I should tell my mom whatâ€™s happening. Iâ€™m scared. I curled up and cried for a solid minute and a half. I think I need to go see a doctor.
