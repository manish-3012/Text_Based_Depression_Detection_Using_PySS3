Any time I try to remember my childhood I break down crying and can't function the rest of the night That's pretty much it. Every year English teachers make you think of a story from your childhood and write about it. Every year I have a breakdown and can't remember shit then make something up to write about. I wish I could remember, I wish I knew why I cry, I wish I could be honest on these essays cuz I usually enjoy writing. 

That's all, just had to complain a little. Sorry.
