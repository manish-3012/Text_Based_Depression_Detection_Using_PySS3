sad face ðŸ˜¢ Let's get down to business.

I've had crushes on 3 girls so far in high school over the past 4 years and none of them have worked out :( 

Fast forward to the start of 2021 school year, there's this new girl who I have a chance with, then my best friend likes her too (he doesn't know I do too)
