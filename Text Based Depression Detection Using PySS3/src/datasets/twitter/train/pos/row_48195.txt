In honor of spooktober... Letâ€™s write a Halloween story! Iâ€™ll write a comment with a word and anyone can reply with another word and another person replyâ€™s to that reply with a new word and the cycle goes on! All the words have to have something to do with Halloween and they have to make sense. Good luck fellow spookers!
