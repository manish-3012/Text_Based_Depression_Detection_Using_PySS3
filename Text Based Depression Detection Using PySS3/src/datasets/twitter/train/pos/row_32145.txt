I Rick-Rolled my teacher on one of my assignments   

So, I take a Film and 3D printing class, and we are required to make a portfolio of all our progress on either Powerpoint, Microsoft Sway, or Wix.com. I chose to do it on Wix. So, I decided to place a tiny YouTube link in the bottom section of my portfolio which linked to the Rickroll. We were supposed to send the link to him so he can check our progress and give us feedback on it. And judging by the comment the teacher left on the task on DayMap (which is a platform our school uses for assignments and stuff) I successfully Rickrolled my teacher. (I promise I did not Inspect element or anything since itâ€™s nearly impossible to do so on DayMap)

I uploaded the images on Imgur since r/teenagers does not allow images for some reason?

It's not as cool as the guy who rickrolled Rick Astley himself, but i still did it!
