15(sophomore) and kinda lost Hey guys, my name is PJ and Iâ€™m a sophomore in hs. I need some advice. So Iâ€™m just kinda lost and floating rn. I had all these big hopes for hs this time last year that were boosted by the amazing first 3 months of hs. Then November/December kicked in and it all went to hell. With nothing to look forward to and no more ambitions, I need some advice on how to get through the boring grind that is your Sophomore  year of hs.
