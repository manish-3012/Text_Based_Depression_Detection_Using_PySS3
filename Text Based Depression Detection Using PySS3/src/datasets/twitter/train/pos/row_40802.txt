Youtube or TikTok? Okay now I got you here furious wanting to comment "YOUTUBE! DUHHH!". Welcome :)

I've got a realistic question. What would be an easier platform to become famous? If we look at TikTok, it's still in an early stage so you don't have TOO much of competition yet. And it's rapidly growing in downloaders and whenever u make a "TikTok", pushing your videos to other users.

On the other hand we got Youtube. A platform wich is (in my opinion) way more fun. But Youtube has A LOT of competition, since it's already been here for years. Plus Youtube has had it's prime years and isn't growing tooooo much anymore (Not sure though). Also caused by the new adsense and all of that stuff.

So I'm asking for your vision, opinion, just your thoughts on this subject. And I know it's hard to see TikTok as a "standard" platform, since I dislike it as well. But please try to look at it realistically. Will TikTok die eventually or will the reign of Youtube take a knee?

So, on what platform is it easier to "break out" in 2020?

Thanks in advance! &lt;3
