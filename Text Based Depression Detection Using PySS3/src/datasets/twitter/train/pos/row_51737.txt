I think I've ruined it with my best friend Me (M16) and my best friend (F16) had been out drinking and we ended up kissing and now we haven't spoken properly for days since and I can't help but thinking I've ruined one of the best things I had in my life. It's hardly like she was against it and she didn't retort but she's also a lesbian and I worry I've caused a whole identity thing for her.

It wasn't forced or anything I think that she was just experimenting (lesbian all through school) and it's really fucked us up. 

Tldr: kissed my lesbian best friend and potentially ruined our friendship
