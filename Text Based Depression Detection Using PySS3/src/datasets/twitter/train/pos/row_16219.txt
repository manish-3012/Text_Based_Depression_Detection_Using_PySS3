I'm just sittin here ballin my eyes out Just sitting in bed crying.  I should be asleep, but watching youtube cause I'm scared to close my eyes man.  And I'm watching videos that make me cry more.  What the hell am I doing?  I just want to be who my parents want me to be but I can't.  sorry to wast you're time.  I probably shouldn't post this but I need to say it somewhere.
