Hey umm this is gonna be long but I need somewhere to vent. What would you do in this situation? 
I did this in form of a tiktok trend cuz comedy is my way of coping. But it is still 100% true.

Put a finger down if you were already pretty lonely and had few friends and then a girl named Cara came into your life and you really liked her for some reason. So you ended up becoming pretty good friends and she asked you to date her and you realized that you would probably like her better as a friend but then she promised you that if it didnâ€™t work out that she wouldnâ€™t let it ruin the friendship. So you go on your first â€œdateâ€ with her and she seems pretty uninterested, so you tell her you were sorry that you made her uncomfortable after the date over text.  So then she tells you that she didnâ€™t exactly tell her parents about you and that they found out so she had to break up with you. You were fine with this but then it ends up ruining the friendship and you find out she was most likely lying about the whole parents finding out thing. You find out the real reason she broke up with you was she just started snapping another guy who turned out to be her verbally abusive ex. The guy she complained about all the time to you and now she is dating him again and threatening her with suicide if she leaves him again. Oh and because of this emotional trauma you are now having to take antidepressants. Oh and now she just snaps you every now and then and says hi and when you respond she leaves you on opened.


Yes I have posted this before but I still canâ€™t get it off my mind and I need help coping.
