I feel like a waste of flesh and extremely helpless my tuition teacher called my mom and told her that I shouldn't continue with her and my mom keeps saying that I can either work hard or live a life of poverty. Thing is every time I try to engage with my work I lose interest in 15 to 20 minutes. I catch myself losing interest and it still happens.The online classes aren't a big help either as i just let my mind wander and switch over to youtube.  can't help but feel like everyone's giving up on me and I think my life just isn't worth living. Cant hold the tears back either. for context Im in 11th grade.
