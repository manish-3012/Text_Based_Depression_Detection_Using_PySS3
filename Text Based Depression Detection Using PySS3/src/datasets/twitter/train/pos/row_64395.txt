There were maggots in the food at my school So basically a few days ago some students in my class were saying that there were worms and maggots in the food. The school didn't do anything about it, instead the school chose to suspend the students who posted it on their Instagrams and Snapchats. 
Edit: I don't eat anything at school so I'm alright but I feel terrible for anyone who actually ate the food before they saw the maggots.
