Yea I'm that forex kid with gold watches and rental cars who flies to Miami every two weeks, and here's how I make 5 billion dollars an hour trading currencies ðŸ’¯ðŸš¨ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ Just kidding, but I did start investing recently in safe, stable companies (since I'm now old enough, yay) and I made $25 after two weeks and I'm so happy hooray ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Just saying, once you turn 18, or look like someone who goes to a uni/college, beware of the forex/"financial education" mans aged 18-23 who flex rental cars and try to sell you their $300/month courses
