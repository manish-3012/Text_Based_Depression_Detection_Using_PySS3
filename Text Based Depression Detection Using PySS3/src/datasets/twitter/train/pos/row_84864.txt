Oh fuck, oh god no! My dad is an actual karen.


He talks all the time about how the mask is dangerous and he can't breathe in them and the virus is a lie and the vaccine will kill us and I should not get vaccinated ever with anything.

He refuses to wear masks and when we force him to he just talks all the time about blm being a terrorist force and Floyd deserved it.


Other than that he only talks about how a useless piece of shit I'm for not achieving anything in this world, yeah I guess that is called evolution, that the next generation has it easier then the old one.


Oh god, I can't take him any longer, always when he talks about climate change being fake and that everyone human being is evil and wants to kill me, I always think of karen.


Is that common? Does anyone else have a racist karen dad?
