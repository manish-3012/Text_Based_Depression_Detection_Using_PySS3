Omg I love Microsoft and any company that lets you download at your actual internet speed and not some 500kbps-1.2mbps I used to have an Xbox and Microsoft would let me download stuff at my actual speed while my ps4 didnâ€™t, and now I donâ€™t have those thing I have but I do have a pc and I barley use the Microsoft store and games like 30gb used to take 16 hours to download but on the Microsoft store it takes 20 minutes. Yeah fuck the companies that wonâ€™t buy better servers even tho they are a billion dollar company. Sorry I need to get that off my chest.
