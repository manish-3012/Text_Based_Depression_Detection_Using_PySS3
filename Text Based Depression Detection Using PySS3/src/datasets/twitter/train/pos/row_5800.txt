I wish I had known I could exploit my parents divorce My parents divorced when I was like 12 and I didnâ€™t know I could use it to get out of doing homework. My dad was legit packing his bags as I was finishing my math homework

Then I see people saying they â€˜couldnâ€™t do their homework because their parents divorcedâ€™ and they say it for WEEKS after it actually happens. I wish somebody had told me about it when my parents split, couldâ€™ve gotten out of doing so much work
