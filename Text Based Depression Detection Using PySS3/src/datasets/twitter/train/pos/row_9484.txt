I think a girl might like me. This starter about a week or two before school closings and I want to know if there was a chance that she might  have liked me. 
So one day at school I heard a group of girls saying something about me. Later that day one of them said hi to me. After that she said hi to me every day since and every time I just replied with "hi" and never asked for her name because I didn't think it was a big deal.
I started to notice that she said hi to me very consistently. To test my theory, I passed her in the hallway approximately six times to see if she would say hi. Surely enough, she said hi every single time. I wasn't able to get her name or contact info before school closed, so I haven't talked to her for half a year so I don't know if I ever had a shot.
Any thoughts?
