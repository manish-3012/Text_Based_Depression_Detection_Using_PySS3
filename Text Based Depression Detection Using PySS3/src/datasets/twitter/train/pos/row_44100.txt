I got fucking scammed and lost 200 usd Hi I am a victim of the new recent scam.Just today I got scammed by someone who somehow had my stean account info.He tricked me by changing my username and description into something that looked like I'm getting VAC ban.He then proceeded to pose as one of my close friends tipping me that I was gonna be ban.Being naive I traded all team fortress 2 items for him to safe keep.Only moments later to realise I had fallen victim to a scam.I checked the history of where my account was being logged on and I pinpoint ot to be from russia.Total I had lost was around 200 dollars.I would like to say guys please watchout and dont fall for scams.Always check what is happening and dont panic.Because I was panicking I lost 1 aussie gold knife (around 40 usd)  5 other unusual  (20 usd each) and some keys (2.60 each).For those of you that want proof u can type in the comments and I'll upload it to imgur and post it here.Todays my birthday and I just feel like crying.
