Why I feel as if I should become a moderator of this subreddit 1. Iâ€™m responsible, one time my mom asked me to babysit my sister. She went missing and her body was found in a field, but I was responsible enough to put up posters.

2. Iâ€™m caring, one time I bullied a furry on tik tok until she quit.

3. I love teenagers, especially young, masculine, strong jaw teens

4. Iâ€™m a dude, itâ€™s easy Iâ€™m a guy

5. I did not commit any crimes, like assault an old lady
