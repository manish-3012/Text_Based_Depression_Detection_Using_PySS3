Why is it that I should not give our opinion to avoid hurting others but when someone else's opinion hurts me I should just put the pain aside and move on? So something bad happened with me (dont wanna discuss that). IDK if this is the right subreddit but it is the most welcoming imo so i thought i can post this here.
