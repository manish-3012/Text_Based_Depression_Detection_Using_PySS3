My mom said I get nothing for Christmas So a little background. Iâ€™ve had quite a mentally unstable year and have been wanting this one pair of jeans for a while now. My mom knows too, but just last weekend, I took the ACT, I told my mom that I donâ€™t think I did well on the math section. Then she said that at home I was scoring pretty high so Iâ€™m basically lying now and gonna get no Christmas present. 

Ik I sound like a baby getting mad over a Christmas present but I never ask for anything and Christmas and my birthday are the only times of the year that I ask for something. This makes me really mad because she now says stuff like â€œwhy donâ€™t you go tell ur math tutor u lied to me abt how ur doing on ur actâ€ and stuff.
