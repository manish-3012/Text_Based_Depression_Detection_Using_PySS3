One of my best friends died yesterday Hey, just to clarify, Iâ€™m not doing this for karma or awards, I just need somewhere to let it out, and I think you guys would be a good place. 

You read the title. My best friend, Evan, died yesterday. He was driving drunk, at night, in an intersection notorious in our town for being slick with black ice after it rains. You can probably guess what happened, he took a turn too fast and spiraled, and then ran into a tree. I just hope to god that it wasnâ€™t painful. I know that it was completely his fault for driving drunk, but I donâ€™t think that he deserved to have his life taken away for makign a few bad decisions. He was 17. I knew that he was having trouble withalcohol, but I didnâ€™t do enough, and Iâ€™m sorry for that, Evan. I just feel lkie  I could have tried to help him, or have gotten him help. He was a good guy- pretty good grades, his girlfriend really loved him, and he helped out at the community center when he could. I just donâ€™t understand why god would let this happen. Evan was one of the best people I ever knew, so why was he taken away? Why wasnâ€™t I? I mean, I donâ€™t do anything good for anyone around me, but Evan did. I just wish that I was in the car, not him. He was there for me when I was being stupid. Why wasnâ€™t I ther for him? And now Iâ€™m just thinking thhat Evan wouldnt have let me think like this. He would always cheer me up when I was sad. I just want so bad tosay sorry to him, sorry I didnâ€™t help him, sorry I was so fucking blind to how much he was hurting, trying to drown it in booze. Im sorry Evan.
