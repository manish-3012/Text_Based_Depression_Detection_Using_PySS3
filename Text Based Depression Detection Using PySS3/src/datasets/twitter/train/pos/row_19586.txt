Whatâ€™s it with people posting transphobic shit? I feel like Iâ€™ve seen an uptick in transphobic comments/posts recently and was wondering if anyone knows why.

Stop being transphobic. Reassess yourself, do some research on the subject, Iâ€™m talking actual research with articles and studies not YouTube videos about how the blue haired trans sjwâ€™s are going to far by stapling 50lbs tiddies to four year old boys who play with dolls.

Trans rights are human rights. Have a nice life.
