My(19F) sister(21) just fucking body shamed me cause I wasnâ€™t amused at her boob joke. Okay. So my sister is known for being an asshole. Sheâ€™s gotten better, but shes still a major asshole. This happened less than 5 minutes ago. 

So Iâ€™m getting ready for church and I had just put on my brand new yellow dress (not important, I just really like this dress) and my sister decides to comment on it. This is how everything went down. 

Me = me, Sis = sister

Sis: â€œThatâ€™s a pretty dress, Glorious.â€ 

Me: â€œThank you.â€ 

Sis: â€œIt makes your small titties look good.â€ *laughs*

Me: â€œ... I donâ€™t know why youâ€™re talking, our boobs are the same size.â€

Sis: â€œI know.â€ 

Me: â€œSo... you just insulted me.â€ (Her tone and the way she laughed told me exactly what she meant when she said what she said.)

Sis: â€œNo, Iâ€™ve come to accept my small boobs, you havenâ€™t which is why youâ€™re so mad.â€ 

Me: â€œThis is why...â€ (I was about to say â€œThis is why i like to pretend you donâ€™t exist.â€ But then she would go crying to my mom, so I shut my mouth. 

I just sighed and started ignoring her. 

The end. 

~This might be a little confusing, as I have a bad memory and tend to forget little tid-bits of info here and there in a short amount of time.~ 

She legit body shamed me cause I didnâ€™t find her â€œjokeâ€ funny. And she wonders why I donâ€™t want to ever hang out with her? Iâ€™m starting to think sheâ€™s a narcissist.
