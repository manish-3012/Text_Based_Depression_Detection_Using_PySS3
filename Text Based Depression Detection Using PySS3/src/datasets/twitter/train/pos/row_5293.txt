If youâ€™re over 18, learn your finances now and start investing for your future If thereâ€™s anything I wish someone told my younger self it would be invest in your self and your education.

Any extra $ you have, find your best available broker app and contribute to it and invest in stocks or ETFâ€™s (exchange traded funds)

No matter how much money youâ€™ll make in your career, it still wonâ€™t cut it for the future youâ€™ve always imagined, the stock market is your golden ticket.

The more you learn about managing your finances and making better investment decisions the quicker you will be able to retire, also salary sacrifice to contribute to your retirement funds.
