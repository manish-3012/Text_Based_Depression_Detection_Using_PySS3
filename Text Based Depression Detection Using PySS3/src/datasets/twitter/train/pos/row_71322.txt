I'm angry at myself and at everyone around me. I'm fat and ugly and weak because my mother refuses to buy good food regardless of what I say. I've asked her to buy healthy food, and I've demanded. All I get is "You don't have to eat what I buy" or "that stuff is too expensive". Fuck you cunt, what else is there even to eat? And your cigarettes and fancy Apple juice are too expensive. I'm mad at myself for having no discipline. I've tried working out, but I give up after i make no progress. I'm angry at myself for having this family of weak and un-ambitious fucktards. I'm angry at being the only person willing to kill and die for things. Everything I want to do in life makes me dumb apparently. I want to adventure, I want to fight, i want to be great. Apparently I should settle for this shitty fucking life I have. I might kill myself someday. I don't fucking know. I'm so tired of being weak, but being the strongest among weak people. I hate my family and I hate myself.
