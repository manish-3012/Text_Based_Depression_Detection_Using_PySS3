Iâ€™m an emotional wreck... Sometimes, when I feel awful, it helps to make a list of things that are making me feel awful. Itâ€™s best if you just donâ€™t hold back, complain about whateverâ€™s bothering you and forget about the rest of the world. I ask not for your sympathy, but for you to get whatever you need to off your chest, too. Whatâ€™s on your mind?

\#1: I just started college an itâ€™s so freaking lonely. Iâ€˜ve got trauma-induced Severe Social Anxiety Disorder (itâ€™s... a mouthful). Makes it really hard to make friends, especially with COVID. Everyoneâ€™s finding their group. No one else eats alone, or walks to class alone, or anything. It just... sucks. It feels so distant.

\#2: COVID. Itâ€™s squeezed almost all the fun out of freshman year. No clubs. No sports. I only have one in person class, meeting once a week. We arenâ€™t allowed to associate with people from another dorm. No orientation. Itâ€™s so bad the college hired a literal clown to put on a ZOOM show last night.

\#3: Just found out I canâ€™t buy any of my textbooks. Itâ€™s a long story, but financial aid issues. I wrote all my professors asking if thereâ€™s some way I can at least turn in homework for the first couple weeks until I get the money to pay for the workbooks and textbooks. Only one will let me. I guess Iâ€™m getting 0â€™s my first week in college :(.  
\#4: Accidentally let it slip to my super extremely homophobic parents that Iâ€™m, well, gay (it just makes my stomach churn writing that :( ). Didnâ€™t go over well. Iâ€™ve managed to put on an act for years. Didnâ€™t know I was on speakerphone. When I say homophobic, I mean my uncle went to jail for throwing a gay man off a bridge, and my dad once made a 15-foot sign saying â€œf-ck the gaysâ€ with AK-47â€™s on it, and stuck it in the front yard. He once thought I was looking at gay pornography (I wasnâ€™t, I was only 13, donâ€™t have a clue where he even came up with that) and I think his exact words were â€œIâ€™ll disown you after I kill you if I ever find out youâ€™re a f-cking f-gâ€. I still canâ€™t believe that shit didnâ€™t end up on the news or something. So now I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™ll be living after the semester.

\#5: My classes are going to be accelerated. To get everyone off campus before Thanksgiving, they decided to cram roughly 15 weeks into NINE. I mean, I donâ€™t usually have trouble academically, but thatâ€™s rough. And thatâ€™s going to be a \*lot\* of homework. I really need to spend more time out of the dorm. Long story, but Iâ€™ve been isolated at home for years. My \*doctor\* says I need to get out more. I donâ€™t relish the idea of being stuck in a dorm, looking at a computer screen for HOURS. I get screen fatigue.
