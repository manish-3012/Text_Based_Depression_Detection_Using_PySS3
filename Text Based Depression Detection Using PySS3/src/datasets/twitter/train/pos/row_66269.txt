â€œDaily Logâ€ #3 I might make two â€œlogsâ€ today. I want to talk about a few topics. 

Anyways todayâ€™s topic is going to be.... relationships!! Specifically, romantic relationships.

Iâ€™ve never had one. Never really wanted one. I donâ€™t really get the appeal. I mean- I donâ€™t even have any friends. 

Even if someone was interested in me (which is impossible) I probably wouldnâ€™t choose to be in a â€œrelationshipâ€ with them. 

I donâ€™t envy those in relationships. And I donâ€™t feel particularly sad or mad about not being in one. I may be in one in the future but I donâ€™t really know.

Same thing with marriage. I donâ€™t see myself ever getting married. Of course itâ€™s hard to tell since Iâ€™m still a teen, but the idea just doesnâ€™t seem to fit with my â€˜plan for the futureâ€™.
