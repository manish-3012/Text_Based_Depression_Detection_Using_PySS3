don't you just hate when your friend goes over the limit? so I had this friend for months and he's pretty homophobic, racist and all that but sometimes he's cool, today he went over the fucking limit, he was already over but it was meh but now he really fucked up for real, I feel bad because I wanted to "fix" him but he's a lost cause and I can do nothing, i can't believe i have to leave him behind, back to loneliness WOOOOOOOOOOO
