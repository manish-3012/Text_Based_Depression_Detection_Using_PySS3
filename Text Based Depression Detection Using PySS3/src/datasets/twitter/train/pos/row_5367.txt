This is how doing math homework goes for me Me: does my math homework

Teacher: you have to show your work or you get a zero

Me: shows work

Teacher: it has to be hand written not typed or you get a zero

Me: shows work on a piece pf paper and scans it in to the teacher

Teacher: I can't read your hand writing so you still get a zero
