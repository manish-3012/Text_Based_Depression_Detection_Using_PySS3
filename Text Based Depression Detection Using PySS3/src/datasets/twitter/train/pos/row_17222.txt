Does anyone else feel like like Biden being elected is like when video game companies triple the price of something, only to immediately reduce it to "only" double after receiving massive backlash, but doubling it was their real goal all along? Y'all know what I'm talking about. I video game company will triple the xp required to get "free rewards" or triple the cost of something and then of course get immediate massive backlash, so they "generously" reduce it to only double which people are somehow ok with. Even though doubling it was their goal all along and still shitty af. They just knew that if they doubled it straight up, the same backlash would ensue, so they would only be able to increase it by like 50%.

It feels like this country was tired of nothing changing and politics not helping people, so politics was like "alright, you want radical change, here" and gave us the WORST possible thing in Trump. Then we were all like "no, no, no. That's not what we want" so politics gave us Biden, and now everyone is fucking ecstatic that he won, even though he's still fucking awful. We literally just got sucked into voting for the same bullshit status quo that got us Trump in the first place, and people are HAPPY about it.
