Losing my best friend Long story short, In Sep. 2019 I befriended a girl, she invited me into her life and made me feel cared for. We became very close and then things fell apart in mid 2020 and I had developed romantic feelings for her. Then in late summer she was telling lies to me, making things up, and mistreating me, even before I had told her about my feelings. In October she decided I was not worth having anymore, so she basically ended the friendship and then told me that she "Just befriended me to be like Jesus." She is a diehard Mormon. She told me many times that she loved me, that we were best friends, that she cared for me, wanted me in her life, and complimented me, and I did aswell. 


With no other context it might be hard to understand why that comment about Jesus was so bad, but it was because she had already hurt me, and she knew it, and because it made the whole friendship seem like a lie just for her to try and convert me to her religion. 

Honestly, nobody has ever said anything more hurtful to me, and some nights I reminisce about the ways I am still hurting due to her abandoning me after saying she was my best friend and what she said the last time we talked, which was months ago. What's the most sad of all is that I love her and she has no idea how much I have suffered emotionally. Even after she has made my life 6 months of utter hell, I still love her and wish this did not happen and that we could still be friends. I miss her.
