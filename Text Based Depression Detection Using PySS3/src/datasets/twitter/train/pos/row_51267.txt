Unpopular opinion: Millie Bobby Brown (and many other teen celebrities) isn't 'mature', rather media trained. I mean, she's 17. But there's like perception around her that she's too mature for her age and she's '40 yr old trapped in kid's body'.

Remember S1 Joe from 'You'?

She's rather media trained.
