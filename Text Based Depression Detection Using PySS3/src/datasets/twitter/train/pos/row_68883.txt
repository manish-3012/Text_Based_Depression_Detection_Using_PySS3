The lion the witch and the audacity of this bitch 
I feel like Iâ€™m allowed to call her a bitch at this point for many reasons. To start this all off she accused me of bullying her. Which it totally didnâ€™t but people believed her so that dragged my reputation a bit. I apologized for nothing so it didnâ€™t spread farther tho. Than we were talking even farther back in time and she legit tells me that she once got dared to see how long she could ignore me for. Like what the actual fuck is the matter with people. Next she bullies me for my anxiety and how I have trouble speaking due to it even tho Iâ€™m getting better at it. I canâ€™t ducking control it and I have fucking memory loss what you want me to be able to remember everything every time because I fucking canâ€™t. And itâ€™s fucked up they made fun of it for me. The last straw was when they did it again and I remembered theyâ€™ve done it once. So I sarcastically say â€œImagine forgetting something you say every day HAHAHAH SO FUNNY AM I RIGHTâ€ because I was fucking mad. She tells me to stf u this is why we arenâ€™t friends I said â€œThatâ€™s exactly what you did to me every time I forgot Get off your fuckin high horseâ€ and she says someoneâ€™s mad for what. Acting like she isnâ€™t a fucking manipulative piece of shit thatâ€™s been stuck clinging to me for help. But Iâ€™m fucking donâ€™t with her sheâ€™s a asshole thatâ€™s never cared about me and it hurts me deep down knowing that. Seriously fuck her that whore.
