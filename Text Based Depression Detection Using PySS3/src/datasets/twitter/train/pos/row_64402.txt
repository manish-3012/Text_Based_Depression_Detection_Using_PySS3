Anyone remember the Canadian TV Show Detentionaire? I was just wondering if there was anyone else that watched the show when it was still airing. Also this show is way too good for the amount of recognition it gets these days, and there is a subreddit dedicated the show that you have to check out: r/Detentionaire
