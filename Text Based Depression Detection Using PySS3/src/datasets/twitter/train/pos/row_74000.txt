please stop faking mental illness. iâ€™m so sorry that you are in such desperate need of attention that you need to resort to that, but please, stop faking mental illness. it hurts me to see people say they have crippling anxiety because theyâ€™re scared to speak in public, or that they have depression because theyâ€™re sad. if only you knew how awful and draining it really is and how offensive it is to fake mental illness â¤ï¸
