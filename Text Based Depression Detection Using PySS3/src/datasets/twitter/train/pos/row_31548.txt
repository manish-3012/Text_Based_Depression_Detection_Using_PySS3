would this work? read below i have a plan to make a quick buck or two. if i go buy a case of pop(soda) for 8 dollars and sell for 10, i can buy more pop(soda) and pocket the two dollars. theres also another case of pop(last time, soda) for 6 i could sell for 8. if you need more details to see if this would work, comment. but i want to see if you guys would go for it.

info: i live in canada and the more expensive pop is coke and the lesser is pepsi.
