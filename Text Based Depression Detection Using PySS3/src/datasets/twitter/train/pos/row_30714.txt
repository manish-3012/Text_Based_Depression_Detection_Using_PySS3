Uneventful and short storytime? Idk what to call this lmao It's not quite a meme but whatever- I'm in my engineering class right now and my teacher (she has a southern accent) was talking to one of her in person students and said something like "I called the dean" but I was only half listening so I heard "I'm Paula Deen!" And I immediately thought of the "butter butter butter" vine and I burst out laughing- thank god I'm on mute
