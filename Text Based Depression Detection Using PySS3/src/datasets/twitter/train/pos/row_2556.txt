i thought a girl at my school was perfect shes so pretty and she seemed so happy whenever i saw her around school. i always wanted to be her. but earlier i found her tiktok and shes actually been dealing with some hard stuff lately and has been really sad. i just find it crazy how i always thought she was perfect and so happy yet she wasnt? just shows people arent always what u think ig
