I just want to put this here This morning, I got up and as usual, my mom came in and took a whole speech about why Iâ€™m so useless all the time. Why im so lazy, dont do anything, cant do anything, that im stupid bcs my grades are low. I just ignored her like always. Then she sent me to get groceries. When I got home, she freaked out and got mad, shouted at me why i bought the wrong groceries when she said that I had to buy what was on the list. I bought everything on the list, but it was still wrong for some reason. They are having breakfast rn and I dont. I dont need it. I have had enough. I have a lot on my mind. A lot of bad thoughts like, suicide or murder. I just cant do that, I dont have the guts for that. Anyway, thanks for reading, ill be on my way now. I do still think I need help
