red flag w this girl? posted again due to no helpful advice

This mornings things were going great like our convo, we were both responding fast etc. For reference I knew her for a month now

So when I came home I did my thing and snapped her and she replied in a fair time but her snap was just a black screen with no text. My snap was glitching at the time and sometimes people's snaps just show up as a black screen. This happened before and she told me it was a glitch

So I asked her if she sent me a black screen or if it's a glitch again. It's been 3 hours now and hasn't responded I'm beginning to think I did something but I didn't do anything

Between these times she's like always online so idk what happened any advice ?

Okay she responded just now but i feel weird opening a snap which she took 3 hours to reply...
