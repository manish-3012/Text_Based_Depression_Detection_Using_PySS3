Sooooo one of my best friends called me crying desperately cause her boyfriend (who also happens to be one of my best friends) left her and dude I just listened to her crying for like 5 minutes. Then I managed to make her feel better and laugh a bit. 

Gosh I'm so sorry for her, damn. They're still friends but a heartbreak is always painful. 

Poor girl...
