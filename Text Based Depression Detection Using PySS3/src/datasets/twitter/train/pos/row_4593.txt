I need help falling out of love. Never have I been so in love with a man who I hate. Who is the most annoying person in this world, but itâ€™s not just that. Heâ€™s set on revenge. He wants to ruin another manâ€™s life just so he can watch him wriggle in agony under his boot. Never have I been so in love with a man so self centered and so full of himself. This is very apparent, due to this fact soley: when he loses to the man whoâ€™s life he wants to ruin, he is in utter disbelief. For he has done everything to make sure this man cannot beat him, and has prepared him to be this way for years. I have never been in love with a man who is my polar oppositeï¿¼.

Who is this man, you ask?

Itâ€™s Dio.

Dio fucking Brando.
