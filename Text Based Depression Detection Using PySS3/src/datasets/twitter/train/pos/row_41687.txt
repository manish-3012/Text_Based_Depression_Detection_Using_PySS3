Help me from cringe pls I have friends who I worked on short films with, and I have their contacts saved on my phone. Only problem is, they upload cringy videos on their whatsapp Status, like images of themselves with heavily glitched overlays and booming bass, or some random player's Free Fire headshot montage with the same style of overlays and music and a poor editor's watermark. I can't stop watching them (I wanna see how bad it gets) but it bugs me to know that they do this lmao, I have no way to telling them that this is pretty cringy without offending them. Any ideas?
