My mom wonâ€™t social distance help! (Iâ€™m on mobile so sorry for format and my English isnâ€™t great so sorry In advance) 

My mom wonâ€™t social distance and is always with her friends. Last night I invited two people over for a social distanced hang out. My mom invited FIVE more people, four of which wouldnâ€™t wear masks. They kept getting close to all of us and saying how their kids were at parties. So Iâ€™m going to die and my older sisters solution is putting a sign on the door, because people who say â€œCOVID doesnâ€™t scare meâ€ will listen to that.
