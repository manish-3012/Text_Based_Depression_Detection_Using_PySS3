How do I gift a book to a friend as a birthday present ? My friend is a big fan of reading , she likes books , so I bought her 2 books for her birthday but the problem here is idk how to gift it to her. Should I just put it on the bag with the letter that I wrote her or should I wrap the book with something ? .

* Excuse my bad gifting skills
