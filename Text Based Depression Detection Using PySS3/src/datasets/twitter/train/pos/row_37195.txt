So I didn't go to school today Today I didn't go to school because frankly, I'm just tired of school shit.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the thing, when I don't go to school, something really important always happens that I can't miss, so I'll keep you updated.

It's currently 8:30AM in my country so it'll be a while until school comes out so I can update, but I pray that I don't miss something important...
