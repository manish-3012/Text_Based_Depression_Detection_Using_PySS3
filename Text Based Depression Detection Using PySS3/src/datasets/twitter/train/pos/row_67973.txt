I love my father 'cause he's very different from the normal parents I don't know where to start but his ways of parenting and what he teaches me is very different from the rest of the parents.

Once I came from my room to downstairs and my dad asked me what I was doing. I told him I was studying. He literally started laughing and mocking me 'cause he didn't believe I was actually studying. He was like "ROLF whatever man". 

In my country "love marriage" is taboo. Arranged marriage is considered normal but my dad is like love whoever you want I don't care and won't interfere in that matter.

He never told me fake shit about how hard he worked to become who he is now. He said to me that had a very low attendance in collage ad spent a lot of time travelling in his bike , gambling and spending time with his friends and blew a lot of money on bikes. He used to love bikes but not now.

Once I told him about my friend who used to smoke weed and do a lot such things but my dad said " It doesn't automatically mean he's a bad person. Don't lose your friendship with him if he has a good personality"

He's the best dad ever.
