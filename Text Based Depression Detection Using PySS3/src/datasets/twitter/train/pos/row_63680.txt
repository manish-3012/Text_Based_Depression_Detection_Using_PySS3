Clearence on a girl So i have been in a discrete relationship with this girl who loved me and i did too but then suddenly she met some new people who she talked a lot with and today she installed apps and other stuff on my phone with permission and she seems like she cares about me but not as much as before she still cares how my hair looks and stops me from spacing out and sits with me but i just saw her with one of the guys she met there werenâ€™t hugging or anything but the were sitting close and she set up his hair and she also sometimes talks with him and follows him around so i just want clearence if you guys think she still loves me
