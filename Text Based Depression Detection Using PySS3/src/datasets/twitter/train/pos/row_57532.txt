I need advice on how to get over this 

Soo.... Iâ€™m back to school next week, and Iâ€™ve been talking to this guy over lockdown and I kinda like him. Only problem is heâ€™s popular, and Iâ€™m kinda an introverted nerd. Itâ€™s that classic nerd for popular story, only thing is, Iâ€™m not sure he likes me as a friend, Iâ€™m worried heâ€™ll ditch me when we get back to school, any advice on how to deal with this ?
