yo guess what heres the reveal and tl;dr: my crush' friend wants to set me up with, well my crush

&amp;#x200B;

ok characters: Ch(crush) K(crush' friend) C(crush' other friend) (K and C have the same name, but spelt differently)

&amp;#x200B;

ok so we are in English class, im sitting next to K, and K asked me if i wanted to, like, go out w/Ch (at this point Ch knew i had a crush on her \[through C\], and thankfully still talked to me after) and i said sure kinda, and, well she said she wanted to set me up w/ Ch, and i said well ok i didnt ask for this but cool.

&amp;#x200B;

so fastforward to music class, and im sitting next to C, with Ch on her left, and while Ch' back is turned, i mention to C that K wants to set me up w/ Ch, and (i think) she told me she knew abt that and (take this w/ a grain of salt) she was kinda suprised when she found out (ill come back here), so i said oh cool and the rest of the lessons came and went, and now im here typing this post

&amp;#x200B;

ok so one thing that i didnt say, was that K had multiple emails from guys asking her to set them up w/ Ch, and every time she just asked who tf they were, and said no, but K actually wanted to set me up w/ Ch
