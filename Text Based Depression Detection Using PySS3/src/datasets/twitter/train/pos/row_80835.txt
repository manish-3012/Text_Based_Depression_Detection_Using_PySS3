My friend's dad thinks that I stole his headphones. My friends dad let my borrow his headphones while I was at his house and after I was finished with them I layed them down on my friends desk. Well after I left   after a few days my friend texted me and said "my dad thinks you stole his headphones and he said you can't come down to the house anymore". What can I do to convince my friend's dad that I didn't steal his headphones? PS. I actually didn't steal his headphones.
