People who argue that men and women can't be friends are ignorant and delusional They're argument relies solely on extremely subjective circumstances, in which both parties are straight, attractive, and feel sexual/romantic attraction. They purposely ignore the existence of aro/ace, bisexual, gay, lesbian, and unnatractive people for their stupid argument. They also base their argument on their own lack of self control, saying dumbass shit like "when I see a woman I wanna marry her, so therefore everyone else feels the exact same way." In all honesty, everyone who argues this is delusional, a bottom feeder, incel, r/niceguys , and is probably posted on r/badwomensanatomy everyday
