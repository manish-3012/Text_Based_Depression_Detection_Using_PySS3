What are some websites I can use to talk to a professional or volunteer about my mental health problems over text messages for free (not therapy)? I'm looking for some websites that offer free help regarding mental health problems but not therapy, I just have a smaller issue that I don't know how to deal with. I'm also not looking for a group chat or anything like that, just one on one interaction. What are some websites I can try?
