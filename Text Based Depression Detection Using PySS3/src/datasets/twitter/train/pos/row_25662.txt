I hate E polls in YouTube. Title says it all, E polls are freaking annoying.

Don't get me wrong, I was also proud of the E culture when it first started, but not, its just some useless E polls in 30% of your recommended feed. Like, I want to watch a video, not see an E poll for the 1.000.000 time.

It has gotten a way for small "content" creators to easily boost their subscribers.

If you support E culture, I'm very impressed by the fact that you are not getting bored by doing the same EXACT thing, over and over again.
