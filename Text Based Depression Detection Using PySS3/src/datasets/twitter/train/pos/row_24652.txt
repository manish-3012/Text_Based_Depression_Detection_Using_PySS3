sure everyone's heard of legal pronouns but what about illegal pronouns?

sure, my legal pronouns are he/him (i'm too shy to come out and also my classmates would give me a hard time) but my *illegal* pronouns are ,uch more fun.

why be some random boy when you can be a they? a them? an NB that can be whatever you can imagine? why not be a small swarm of bees?
