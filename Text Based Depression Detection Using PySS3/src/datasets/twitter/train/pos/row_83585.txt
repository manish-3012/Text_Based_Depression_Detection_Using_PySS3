I Got a Job as a Dishwasher. 
I fucking hate it. Iâ€™m working for experience/money. By experience, I mean something that I can put on my resume. 

Iâ€™m a dishwasher. Iâ€™ve worked for a week. Itâ€™s been a training-esc week. 

Will it get better? I donâ€™t like it. I feel like I could get something better. I donâ€™t know if I want to leave a week in. 

This is my first job.
