how do i trust people again. so i very rarely open up to people because i feel like i canâ€™t trust them at all. the last person whom i trusted was my gf, and we broke up at the end of august but weâ€™re still friends. i wanna be honest with her that i low key wanna get back together with her because she was nothing but great to me and i felt really great when we were together, and i hope she felt the same too. i only feel like i can talk to my parents but ben id feel bad because their only son isnâ€™t 100% perfect and the at i would be burdening them more than i already have been, i just wanna learn how to trust people again.
