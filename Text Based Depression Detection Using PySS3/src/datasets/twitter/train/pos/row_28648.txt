I'm fucking done My mum goes into my room, brakes my stuff without me knowing, I then go back to my room to find my stuff broken, tell her because I know she did it and then she says it was my fault because I should have know it would brake. I just can't deal with me anymore she just harasses me and wind me up and the tells me not to shout at her in her house, I wish I could go and live with my dad sometimes.
