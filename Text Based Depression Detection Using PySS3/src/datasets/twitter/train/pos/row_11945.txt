How do you identify a hustler? There are multiple ways to identify a hustler, and maybe not every of the ones listed here is obvious, but it still helps to know what you should look out for if youre trying to know if someone is a hustler.

- If he is barely replying to your messages because he doesnt have time for unneccessary social stuff

- If he randomly wakes you up at 3am and screams: ,,Get up and work!" at you

- If he occasionally runs through the living room, always repeating the words ,,Hustle, Hustle, Hustle, Hustle" pretty loud

- If he sometimes says or replies to you with ,,I am working too hard ðŸ˜©"

- If he ends everything with ,,Represent", ,,G" or ,,Hustle 247"

I hope this can help yall!

Represent, G! Hustle 247
