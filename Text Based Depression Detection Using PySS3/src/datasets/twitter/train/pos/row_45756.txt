Does anyone else here hate school, but love studying for personal growth? Like I canâ€™t even express how much I hate school because of the number of unreasonably long assignments I get, but for some reason, I canâ€™t help but think that if I werenâ€™t doing those for school Iâ€™d actually be happy about them.  Does anyone else feel this way?
