Idk where else I can brag about this, but today I start an actual exercising and did 200 pushups. Since today is the very beginning i was trying to see what my limits are. So for every little exorcise I did I did ten times before doing something else until I felt like doing that special thing again. 


And this is where Iâ€™m fucking bragging. I did 200 pushups and finished the last ten literally five minutes before midnight. And Iâ€™m really fucking impressed with myself.
