you all need to go to therapy (read this) seriously. we're all teens, not trained professionals. we can relate to you, but please reach out to someone irl if you can, because thats all we can do. 

talking about suicide and SH and stuff on a public subreddit is not only boring and repetitive to scroll through (and you won't get the help you need) but can be a reminder to others of their own feelings, and reddit should be an escape. also, you're triggering or making people feel bad for not helping you. i appreciate its difficult to talk about feelings, but do so in DMs, or ask if someone can talk to you. 

you are worth it and have a place on this planet, you will find a partner who loves you back, life will get better; but please, help yourself by reaching out beyond social media. when you get help irl, it will happen. otherwise you're venting out into the void and it'll make you feel worse.
