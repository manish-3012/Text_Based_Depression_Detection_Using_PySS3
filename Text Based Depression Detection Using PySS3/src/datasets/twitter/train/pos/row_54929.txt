Minnie, 18 has just left me. 2020 fucking sucks. My dog, Minnie has been my best friend my whole life. She was a blessing to my family. Yesterday we took her to the vet because she was very ill. Sadly, she passed away. My family and I cried a lot. It hit me the hardest. I am still really upset right now and Iâ€™m wondering if you guys have any advice on how to deal with this. 
Thanks and love you guys &lt;3
