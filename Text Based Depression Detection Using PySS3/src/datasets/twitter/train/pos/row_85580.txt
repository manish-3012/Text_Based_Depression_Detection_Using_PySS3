Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 21 Welp, yesterday didn't have a fact, but it wasn't my fault! My internet was being stupid, so the fact didn't post, I promise! Anyways, I'll post yesterday's fact now, and today's this evening. See ya!

Fact: For about 20 years, Pluto is actually closer to the Sun than Neptune! This is because Pluto's orbit actually crosses inside of Neptune's for about 20 years out of the 248 years it takes for Neptune to complete one orbit. This actually happened back in 1979! So from 1979 to 1999, Pluto was technically the 8th planet from the Sun, since it was still considered a planet back then!

Now I know what you may be thinking: Does this mean Pluto could eventually collide with Neptune? Well, I have some good news! Because Pluto orbits above the Sun's orbital plane (the plane that Neptune is on), it is never actually in the exact same spot as Neptune. In simpler terms:

When Pluto and Neptune are in the same spot, Pluto is way above Neptune, so their orbits never actually intersect. As a result, everyone's favorite dwarf planet never gets any closer to Neptune than about 1,487,000,000 miles!
