So me and my friend did a thing We have started a subreddit that would enable teens to get to know other teens and chat together. This would be a really cool idea during this pandemic and would help pass everyone's time. 


Here it the subreddit if you feel like checking it out: r/teenfriendship


Thanks and always remember, no pedos.
