Just wanted to say this even if no one cared     My stepmom was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer about a month ago and two days ago she had the operation to remove the tumor. I am so glad we caught it super early, considering her sister and her aunt are in stage 4 which is scary as fuck and we are all praying for them. She is in alot of pain but she is recovering well and since today is Thanksgiving she might not be able to spend it with us. Just...wanted to say this. :)
