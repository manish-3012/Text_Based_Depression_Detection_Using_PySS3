My friend hit on me... So my best friend came out as homosexual around 2 months ago and he told me that he had feelings for me, I said politely "well, that's cool but I dont feel the same way. I'm into women." I was nice about it and tried not to be awkward but he has not spoke to me since which really suck cause we used to talk every day. I dont understand why he wont talk to me even though I said it was alright. I've just been so down since the whole thing.
