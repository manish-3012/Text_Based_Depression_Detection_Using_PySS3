Scooby Doo is very loyal to Shaggy and the gang, Great danes run at 30mph while the fastest a human has ran was 28mph (most recorded speed) but The average speed for humans is 8mph between 15mph. So Shaggy could be running anywhere between there but Scooby is willing to slow down to make sure his friend is safe.

Scooby could have just escaped at any time because he fears losing Shaggy more than being caught by the monster.

Here are 3 examples of Shaggy and Scooby putting their fears aside to save their friends.

1: In Scooby Doo where are you? Shaggy jumped on a moving minecart that Scooby was trapped on just to save him.

2: In what's new Scooby Doo, the 2 of them went into a cemetery where the monsters were roaming to rescue Daphne.

3: in the most recent series Scooby Doo and Guess who in the Batman episode they went to rescue Velma from the joker when he was dressed as man bat.
