Posting random facts almost everyday till I get a Girlfriend Day 19: The spiciest chile is the Carolina Reaper. It measures 2,200,000 in the Scoville Heat Unit. It really doesn't kill you, inless you overdose from capsaicin. You need 3 lbs of this to die. You can also die from an allergic reaction, or choking on it.
