Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 91 Nine Days Remain.  


If you have any questions or topics about space for me, you can always leave those in the comments. See ya!  


Fact: A lot of people talk about Phobos when referring to Mars's moons. I even made a fact on it back in the early days of this series. However, Mars has another moon that doesn't seem to get as much attention. That's right, we're talking about Deimos! 

&amp;#x200B;

Deimos is very similar to Phobos in many ways. They're both shaped like asteroids and most likely made of similar materials, leading most scientists to believe they actually *are* asteroids that were captured by Mars's gravity a *very* long time ago. However, what I find to be the most interesting (and, honestly, sad) thing about this little guy is that it's never had a dedicated mission sent to it! To be honest, both of the Martian moons have bad luck when it comes to exploration. Three missions to Phobos (all from the Soviet Union) have been launched, and not a single one of them actually reached their destination! But hey, at least people actually felt Phobos was worthy of sending a mission to! Deimos has only ever gotten proposals! The coolest of these, in my opinion, was a proposed NASA mission back in the late 90s called *Aladdin*. It would have visited both Phobos and Deimos, and chucked some projectiles at them. The debris kicked up by these impacts would be picked up by the probe, and eventually returned back to Earth for study. This mission actually became a finalist for NASA's Discovery Program, but it ultimately lost to the *MESSENGER* probe sent to Mercury. To be fair, *MESSENGER* was a pretty cool mission, but I still really hope we see a mission to Phobos and/or Deimos soon!
