How to not be awkward with a friend after a fight when their parent is there. A little bit of backstory, so this friend I have been friends with for a long time has anxiety and takes everything seriously and yesterday he got mad at something I said and we got in a big fight over it. (His type of family is the good Christian type of family btw) An it just so happens I have to ride to marching band with him and his dad an in half an hour, oh, and his dad has no idea anything has happened. How do I not be awkward in the car ride? Need answers quick.
