Do I resist the urge to text my crush? I really really want to talk to him but I'm afraid I'll annoy him. I'm not even his friend, we just met a few days ago but I like him a lot and I want to get to know him! The problem is, I don't want to piss him off or be needy. What do I do? Do I text him or I stop myself, and if I do stop myself, how?
