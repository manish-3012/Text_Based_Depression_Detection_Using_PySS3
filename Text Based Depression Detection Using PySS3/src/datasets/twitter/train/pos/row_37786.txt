Is it normal that there are internet hoee on reddit following you out of nowhere? My account existed for a few fays, and a few hours after I started posting that account Susan_-_Cole followed me for no reason. No PM, no comments on my post or replies to my comments, just creepily follows. It has no comment history, only a single post with a link to My Sexy Reddit that I dare not click. Help me.
