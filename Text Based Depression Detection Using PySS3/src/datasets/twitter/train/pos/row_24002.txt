My friend just committed suicide... His name was Zach. We met many months ago on discord to play a fun multiplayer game with each other and played many times before realizing we both had a lot of the same interests.

Just like me he wanted to be a pilot. We both had a passion for aviation, and we flew together on our flight simulators all the time. We even had plans to fly from Honolulu to London online together in one day just for fun.

It seemed like he had his life going for him too. He had a girlfriend of like 7 years. He had plans to go into the Air Force and become a pilot. He even had a job interview in Las Vegas at Gordon Ramsayâ€™s kitchen.

He had to return his pc a few days ago to the place he rented it from so I havenâ€™t talked with him in a few days which almost makes matters a little worse. The last thing we talked about was making plans to play a new game that had just came out together when he got his pc back. Its an add on for the game we met on, and we had even talked about how amazing it would be if it got added a while ago.

His girlfriend just let me know on discord what had happened. She told me they went out a few days and he even got me a $50 gift card and he told his girlfriend he wants us to play some games, she could also tell something was wrong when he said that.

The worst thing is I could tell there was something wrong, I didnâ€™t know what it was I just donâ€™t know how to feel cause it seemed like everything was so amazing. It all seems surreal, and I donâ€™t know what to think about it all. 

I never thought Iâ€™d meet someone who had pretty much all the same interests as me and then just like that I donâ€™t again.

Sorry for the clutter in the feed and thanks for reading.
