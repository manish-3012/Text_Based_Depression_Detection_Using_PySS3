I accidentally said that I want daddy sauce at the dinner table. So I was having dinner with my brother and parents and my mother asked my brother if he wanted to have some sauce made by my father.He said sure and then I   said "I too want some daddy sauce" unintentionaly.My brother bursted out laughing and he almost choked on his food while mom tried to control her laughter so she wouldn't drop the *daddy sauce*.

My father just went outside and laughed for 5 minutes straight.

Moral of the story:I should be more careful when twisting words in my own language.
