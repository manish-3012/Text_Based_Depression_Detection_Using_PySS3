An open letter to those who feel self conscious You guys are fucking incredible, I'm fully serious, get up and look in a mirror right now, I'll wait.

You doing it? Good.

I want you to look past the acne, the braces, the glasses, anything that makes you feel self-conscious and realise that you dudes are kings.

No. Kings aren't good enough for you people, you guys are fucking Gods. Because the ability to look past your flaws and instead see your strengths is a supernatural ability that not many people possess.

Mabye you get bullied, mabye you have no friends or mabye your the most popular guy in school with a girlfriend and everything sorted out, I dont care.

I just want to let you know that someone out there loves and cares about you even if it might not feel like it some days.


With Lots of Love,
