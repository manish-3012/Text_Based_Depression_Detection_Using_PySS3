I have an interview for my dream job today does anyone have any tips!!! I have an interview for my DREAM PLACE TO WORK today! Iâ€™m in the U.K. and weâ€™re in lockdown. The interview is over Teams for a job when the place reopens to the public!! 

Itâ€™s The Wave in Bristol, an inland surfing lake, to work front of house restocking the shop, cleaning, making coffee, a bit of waitressing, stuff like that! 

Iâ€™m SO excited and a bit nervous! I want to get the job SOOOOOO much! My interview is in a couple of hours. Does anyone have any tips! I really would appreciate it!
