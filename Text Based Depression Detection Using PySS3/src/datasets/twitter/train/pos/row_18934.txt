How do I ask my girlfriend if she is cheating? Hey r/teenagers, I have been in a relationship for a while now and I am getting really anxious over the amount of times my girlfriend refuses to hang out because she is doing things with friends. This may not sound like such a big deal but in her friendship group is her ex boyfriend who she never talks about and who I think may be going out with her. Am I being over anxious?
