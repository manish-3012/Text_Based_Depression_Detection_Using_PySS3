And how's your day? I tried to sleep from midnight to 11:30 and my body decided to not let me sleep.

I went to my studio to do some progress with a painting that I drew, it fell on the ground. I think I made it ugly as fuck. The colours fell on my shirt.

I went back home to eat lunch knowing well I only have less than an hour before I need to go to my summer job.

My lunch fell on the floor and the plate has been broken.

And how's your day?
