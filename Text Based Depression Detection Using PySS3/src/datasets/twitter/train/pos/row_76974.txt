A guide on how to get a girlfriend... ...from a guy who has never been in a relationship so I might quite possibly be talking out of my ass idk.

1) **Dont, and I cannot stress this enough, simp over her** Aight? Simping is never gonna accomplish anything. And you can take my word for it, someone who simped over a girl for about 3 months. 

2) *Don't be pathetic** By that mean, complaining about shit. For example; Going on the internet and saying shit like "I am so ugly" "no one loves me" is not going to make a girl wet for you she ain't gonna be like "mr. u/toesucker69 I want youðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ" No. That's not what's gonna happen. She might feel pity for you but that's about it.

3) **Maintain atleast basic level hygiene** Aight, so you might  not be the most attractive person but looking and smelling like absolute dog shit isn't also gonna get you anywhere. Alright, maybe you cannot do much about your appearance, but you can still look presentable and confident, which brings me to point 4.

4) ** Be confident** So here's the thing, there's a fine line between being confident dude and being a cocky asshole and, I think, in the end it just comes down from person to person. For someone you might be chill but confident dude and for someone else you might be an arrogant cocky bastard.

5) **Make sure you are ready for a relationship** Now I don't know a lot about relationships but even I understand that you need to be ready for one and that you need to be able to loce someone. And also make sure the other perso5is also ready for one. Don't try to guilt trip them into one or force them into a relationship. Not only that is that an awful thing to do, a relationship like that is also gonna fail. So before ypu get into one, male sure you understand a relationship is much more than what you might think and that you're ready to handle it.

6) Give them a frog, or a pretty rock, or a pretty leaf. That is bound to work.

   **Aight so I have run out of things to say. So that is it I guess. I'll keep updating if I remember anything else**
