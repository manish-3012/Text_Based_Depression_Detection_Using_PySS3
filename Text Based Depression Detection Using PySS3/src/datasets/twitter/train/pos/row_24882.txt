Ranting about relationship Cringe alert 

Iâ€™ve always had a weird standpoint on relationships 
Like I have always has weird tastes that made me nit fit in at all
It was mostly fine because a friend of mine was really sweet 
And helpful , she rarely talked to me but I remember that she made a difference in me , she used to hug me , and she just treated me like no other people on the school would , 

So eventually people like â€œPaired up â€œ in groups , and I was just left alone 
I donâ€™t feel like I connect with any of them , I donâ€™t feel like I connect with anyone at all , I like weird things I try to fit in with the norm ,but then I start feeling bored because that is not really who I am , so i donâ€™t have a bond that makes feel like a belong anywhere . When I really bond with someone they just start slipping away and just stop talking to me , I know itâ€™s my fault because I am really weird ,but itâ€™s hard to see how everyone you used to love just doesnâ€™t even bother to talk to you 

And thatâ€™s everyone on my school , I feel like I am â€œthere â€œ
Like I am not really anything important , people wonâ€™t talk to me unless they are forced too . Because they just donâ€™t care about me 

So I made a friend /gf up , Iâ€™d like to say sheâ€™s more of a friend than a gf 
But itâ€™s also a girl so itâ€™s a girlfriend at some rate 
I tend to imagine I world where I talk to her , and I just live happily , 
And I know I donâ€™t have to worry about my appearance , because I know she would love me either way 
The problem is I feel like I am lying  to myself ,  because I have super high expectations , and then I go back to my life and there is no way anything like that is ever happing , I try to talk to my old friends , nothing , I try to be happy ,nothing 

I just have one plan left ,but I donâ€™t know if I like it ,because if it fails it fails catastrophically , moving to another place /school/country 
If there is no one in my school that gives a fuck about me , maybe they would in some other school , maybe if I find another girl like me , she can be my girlfriend , but I am setting some super high standards on me , especially when you look  how shitty I am 

Here are my standards so you can judge 

-be at least quite cute  , 
- have a sense of humor , the more it fits with mine the better we bond 
-have something in common with me , the more things the better 
-be a little mature , like donâ€™t be one of this Tiktok girls  that feel like robots
 And just do anything to fit the norm , because I am the furthest thing from the norm , so then you just wouldnâ€™t like me 
-but also be a little silly , and fun , and sweet 

This is really a lie , I have quite high standards of beauty 
Like for example (not trying to be racist by any way )
I donâ€™t feel attracted to black people , or even like tanned 
Sorry if I offended anyone but I donâ€™t , 
Uh actually I think that it , damm I sound really racist , 

I actually found this girl once (the girl I talked at the begging )  but she changed school and although I try to talk to her itâ€™s not the same 
So that is my rant ,

Sry for bad English btw
