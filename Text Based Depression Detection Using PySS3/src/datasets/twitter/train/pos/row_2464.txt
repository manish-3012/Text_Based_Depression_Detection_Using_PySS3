I lost 155$ I hide my money due to my family, it was in a good place for a while, until my mom found it. She told me about it and I hid it again, but 2 days later, all of it was gone. No money no coins no nothing. I got fucked I was saving it for a pc/gaming setup. And now itâ€™s gone. I have no job. This was from birthday money/Christmas money. There are 2 people in the house that might of took it. But now, this is just a bunch of bullshit.
