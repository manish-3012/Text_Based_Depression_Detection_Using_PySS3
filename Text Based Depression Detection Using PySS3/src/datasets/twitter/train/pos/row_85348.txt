I feel shitty and guilty ugh So my favorite teacher told us to get this quiz done bc it was due yesterday and gave a speech about why we had to do it and of course me and my dumb self didn't heed the warning and now the quiz is locked and i have to do it before the end of the marking period to keep a good grade. Now i have to  humiliate myself and email him to set up an appointment to take it so he can proctor it and I just feel so embarrassed my gosh
