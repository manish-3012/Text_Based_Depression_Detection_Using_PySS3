A letter to USPS Here's the thing - I don't want you to be shut down or anything. But there are some serious issues we need to discuss.

You told me that my package will arrive between 10am and 2pm. It's currently 2:29pm. Yeah, I get that you're having some issues and I'm surrounded by a wall of fire and my street is under construction so cars aren't allowed on it, but I still expect you to live up to your promise. I saw your van an hour ago, and yet I don't see my package.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you and give me my package. I'll sue. I swear to god, once I run out of my stash of Priority Mail Padded Envelopes I'll start shipping with UPS. They at least let me see the exact location of the driver so I may stalk them all day.
