Hot take: Spiderman Into the spiderverse is not that good. It's really not and I'm tired of pretending that it is. I'm not saying the movie is bad, its definitely not, but it has a lot of problems that people just ignore. To start, the plot is just ok. Now this might just be become I had high expectations, but the plot of this movie is so overdone, and it's not like they convey the same overused plot in a unique way. The narrative that the story speaks is basically "if you believe, you can release your inner potential" which is a plot that has been done many many times before, but this one doesnt even do it well. A good example of this kind of plot being done well is Kung Fu Panda. My problem with the way spiderverse does this is that they show Miles failing to use his powers all throughout the movie then a small pep talk with his dad or whatever gives him the power. To start that pep talk wasnt written very well, like I was expecting the pep talk miles dad gives him would be on the same level as uncle Ben, but it wasn't. Which sucks, because that was meant to be a powerful moment, the moment that made all the spider men/woman become who they were but it didn't work, and it made it feel like miles just obtained his powers just so he can get out of the chair. This movie also just shoves shit down your throat, like at the end when miles in spider man outfit tells his dad he loves him. I fucking hate when the movie has to pretty much tell you shit. If this movie were really good, they would tell you this through the character, and not the dialogue. Sorry to all you spiderverse fans, but this movie isn't a god send. You dont need to jizz in your pants any time the movie is shown.
