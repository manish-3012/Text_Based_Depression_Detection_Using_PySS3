My parents constantly blame â€œthis generationâ€ Whenever thereâ€™s something that involves video games, electronics, etc., they always bring up stuff like â€œoh your generation is so lazyâ€. Excuse me, what is that supposed to mean? Youâ€™re basically calling me lazy because I want to watch some TV.

I just want to know if itâ€™s only my parents or anybody elseâ€™s.
