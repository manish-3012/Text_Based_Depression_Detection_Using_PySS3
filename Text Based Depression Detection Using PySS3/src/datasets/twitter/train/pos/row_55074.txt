Guys. Fucking take care of yourself man. Both mentally and physically SERIOUSLY. Don't go around your school or college looking like a savage! I can't believe I have to say this but some dudes(I used to fall in this category too) just don't fucking take care of themselves.

Let me explain-

So we were just ridin' my bus from my school to my home and my then crush was sitting behind me. She needed help with something and when I looked back to help her, I saw my reflection in the window. I WAS FUCKING DISGUSTED BY MY OWN CONDITION. That's when I actually started taking care of myself. Brushing twice, styling my hair MYSELF instead of MY MOM, Working out and actually taking care of my skin. I can tell you, my confidence went through the damn roof. Pretty soon tho, my crush on her faded away and I got interested in other girls. And I can clealy see they are more into me because of my change.


tl;dr- FRICKIN' TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!!
