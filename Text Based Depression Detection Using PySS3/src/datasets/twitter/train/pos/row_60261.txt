Today was slightly unlucky Today the girl I like (who is on my bus) came into the bus shortly after every seat was filled out, so they had to pick seats with someone they likely didn't know. The girl I likes SISTER who is in the same grade sits next to me, instead of my crush. It was still nice tho, because I had a reason to improve my posture. Ngl both of em are cute doe
