My cat got hit by a car.... So let me tell yall something I was eating my dinner and my poor cat was wrapped in a blanket by my neighbor's so my sister aent out and shouted my cats name (his name is patch) and all she heard was cries so she went to the road and she was greeted by the neighbor's holding the cat in a blanket and his eye was out of his socket his tongue was hanging out he broke a couple bones so then after we took him to the vetrenairy he needed stitches and stuff so he was there for like a week not to sure but after the time period he came home with a cone safe and sound I had tears of joy and he snuggled up to me after ðŸ˜Š
