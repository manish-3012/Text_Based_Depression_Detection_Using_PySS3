because u/WilliamAfton131 did not update his profile to include how to hide a body, i will. the whole thing started when i saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/comments/mj7f2v/cursed_purple/) on r/cursedcomments. in said post, it was revealed that u/WilliamAfton131 would update somewhere how to hide a body and since my 2-second search concluded that as false, i would enjoy doing this for him:

&amp;#x200B;

the first thing is to get a way to hide the body in plain sight. no open body in trunk thing. the suitcase can work for example. take the body fast before it gets to smell and suspicious. once you arrive at a very very secluded area, dig out a two-foot wide 10 ft or a bit less. don't dig a full wide body grave because choppers will look for 6 ft disturbed ground. also, take out teeth and hands so the body can is identified. next, cover the body in yogurt because bacteria can have their pick in dead bodies in your secluded area and will take longer to come around those lazy privileged assholes. anyway, after covering the body in yogurt (that bacteria love and will flock towards) lower it standing or head first into your small grave and cover it. depending on how far it is along put it in immediately or wait a bit. then cover in a layer of dirt (but thick enough so one shovel swoop won't reveal it) and then put a dead animal above. even better if you cover it in plants or foliage. the goal is to make sure the burial site isn't even discovered. if it is\*, hopefully, the animal will throw them off but even past that hopefully, the body is decomposed and unidentifiable so it cannot be traced back to you. 

\*but i doubt it because good luck finding a two-foot-wide disturbed ground under some plants. (also you are looking for 6 ft of disturbed ground if you are a police search team)
