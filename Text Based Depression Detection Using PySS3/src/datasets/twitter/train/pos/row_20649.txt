Story Time Yesterday I went to my tution classes and one more guy was there he's older than me, he asked my why I don't talk to anyone and stay silent I told him I don't like making friends and I feel uncomfortable around people, he said that I shouldn't do that having friends is important and they help you learn alot they teach you right/wrong they help you get through problems and suicidal thoughts etc, I was like "uh, yeah, u r right, true, true I'll try"

But what I didn't tell hi was that I know the difference between right and wrong, I have dealt with suicidal thoughts on my own, I know ALOT about world and friends sucks, but I couldn't tell him because I was overthinking at that time and now I don't wanna talk to him but j want to tell him what I didn't tell him
