Supporting Pedophilia is the Most Extreme Form of Liberalism Possible On Twitter people have been supporting pedophilia, but they don't call it pedophilia, they call them MAPs, which stands for Minor Attracted Person. The name alone says this is the product of extreme liberalism, it's kinda like arguing calling black people African Americans; however instead of wanting black people, and white people to be treated the same, you want child sex to be legal. Supporting pedophilia is the ultimate version of liberalism, here's their argument. "If the kid consents to sex, why can't the guy have sex with them?" That sounds like a creepy hippie, who wants to fuck kids, but it also closely relates to this argument. "If i'm not hurting anyone, why can't I [blank]?" 

I'm not saying all liberals support pedophilia, or are pedophiles; however i'm saying supporting pedophilia is the most extreme form of liberalism.
