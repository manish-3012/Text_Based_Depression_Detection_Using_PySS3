idk whether or not to laugh or cry at this point so thereâ€™s this guy. weâ€™re best friends. weâ€™re both depressed. iâ€™m mad in love with him.

he rejects me, then stands me up at a basketball game. we fight because i have abandonment issues and trauma(thx mom and dad)

i find out on valentineâ€™s day he has a gf. cool. whatever. if it makes him happy iâ€™m happy. but he didnâ€™t tell me so iâ€™m sad about that.

next day we stop being friends. i start having panic attacks every other  day. then quarantine happens. not good.

months later i follow his gf on instagram. she follows me back. proceeds to rub it in for the next three hours about how much he loves her but about how bad of a gf she is to him. i begrudgingly give her advice bc again, if heâ€™s happy i should be happy.

a month later i get a text. from the dude. he got dumped and is now crawling back to me(oh how surprised i was-_-). i proceed to be his emotional support for two months.

then he sends me a shirtless snap and starts ghosting me on and off for the next three months.

and today i just found out that our exes go to the same goddamn school.

so should i laugh, cry, or both?
