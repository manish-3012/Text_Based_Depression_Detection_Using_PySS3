Is Iâ€™m a bad sibling? So i have sensitive hearing so the house is very  quiet and my parents i have to make sure that my little brother keeps quiets when he is playing his toys or playing the game but they were at work today so i had to keep him quiet for today ( he 7 years ago rn ). So today he was downstairs playing fortnite and he was being loud so  i told him that he needed to be quiet.Then when i upstairs and went to my room then  he started screaming and yelling again so i told him to be quiet for the second time or he have to go to his room. So then after like 3 mins he starts screaming AGAIN so went downstairs turn off the tv and told him to go to his room. Then he started crying and screaming and yelling at me and my ear started to hurt so i got very irritated. And in rage i drag him all the way upstairs and unlock him in he room for like 15 mins or so.
