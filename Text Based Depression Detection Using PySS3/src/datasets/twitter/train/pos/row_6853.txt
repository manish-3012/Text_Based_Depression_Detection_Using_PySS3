Hey you in lockdown If you are not exercising often because of lockdown, I want you to know that itâ€™s bad for you and will haunt you after it ends. 

I know itâ€™s hard, but I recommend you do this exercise. Itâ€™s really satisfying and good for you

Set a 20 minute timer, and repeat this exercise as many times as you can within the 20 minutes. 

- 50 jumping jacks 
- 15 push-ups
- 20 mountain climbers (for each side)
- 15 squats

I can usually reach about 7 in terms of reps (times youâ€™ve done the entire exercise in the 20 minutes)

Iâ€™m not trying to get you to do unnecessary work, I just donâ€™t want you to become unhealthy and get into a bad condition.

It doesnt matter how many you can do, what matters is that you do it! Donâ€™t give up!
