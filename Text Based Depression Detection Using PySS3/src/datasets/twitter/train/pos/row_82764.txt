A different view on tik tok Let me make this clear: Im not saying Tik Tok good. I think Tik Tok really sucks for various reasons. *However* It should not be banned. 

Lets begin with the obvious. Let's say that Tik Tok is a water bottle, and its community is the water. If you break the water bottle, or it just ceases to exist, then its contents flow everywhere. In this case, they will flow to different platforms and ruin those. 

Next, Tik Tok and China. Tik Tok is pretty sketchy, yes. Its owned by a Chinese Company and its servers are routed through China. Chinas laws allow the Chinese government to view anything that is on those servers. Thats pretty bad, but thats not a good reason to ban Tik Tok unless yalls are ready to ban every single tech company with sketchy privacy policies and a bad track record of keeping user privacy private. These companies include Google, Amazon, Zoom, etc. 

Moving on, the content on Tik Tok. Yes, obviously your 13 year old sister twerking for the camera is a great way to attract pedophiles. Yes, there is an almost infinite amount of cringe on Tik Tok. As for the twerking, that shit should absolutely be banned but it wont, and you can find that shit on every platform. As I previously stated, the cringe will flow to other platforms if Tik Tok is gone. 

Anyways, thats all I can think of on this matter for now. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
