I picked up trash from my park today. I feel good about myself! I was kind of bored and usually play video games all day but I just got a girlfriend so I wanted to exercise more. I cleaned up the park(picked up trash) and then went home. Sorry about the brag but Iâ€™m just very happy I did that and I want to share my happiness so maybe others can do the same.
