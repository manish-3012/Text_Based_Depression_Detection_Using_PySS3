Giys I'm :( My dog will enter my room but he wont lay next to me or even sit next to me on the ground 

He slept once in my bed and will sometimes jump up on my bed but he will always jump off a minute later

He always sits next to me in the Livingroom

Do yall know how to make him more comfortable in my room
