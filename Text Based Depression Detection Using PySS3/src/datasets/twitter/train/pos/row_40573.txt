Hey yâ€™all I need some advice or ideas about what I should get as a little sorry/thank you gift for my friend group, first time seeing everyone in 3 months I did something a while ago,  and Iâ€™m finally going to a party with my friends and I wanna bring about 5-10 people somethin just as a little gift. I already have talked and apologized and all that the last three months, I just want somethin that would be nice to get them all thatâ€™s not super expensive
