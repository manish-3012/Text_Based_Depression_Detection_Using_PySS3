What you guys/gals can learn from my relationship experience. So, Iâ€™m a 19 year old Male and Iâ€™ll be sharing my â€œrelationshipâ€ story with you so you donâ€™t make the same mistakes I have.

I apologize for the long post; Iâ€™ll make a TLDR :))

Background: I was 18 at the time, fresh out of Basic and AIT for the Army since October 2019. I was struggling mentally and socially for quite some time but I hid it to fulfill my dream of being a soldier.

I got home and I was happy for the most part but i had my moments. Fast forward to March 2020, my (ex friend) and I started actually hanging out and thatâ€™s where I met that girl.

The girl led me on for 2-3 months and vigorously tortured me mentally only for me to find out she was using me as amusement for herself and friends and also to make her boyfriend (my ex friend) jealous. (She lied about him and that).

I was destroyed and they laughed and guilt tripped me for â€œruining their lifeâ€ and â€œtaking advantage of themâ€. You wonâ€™t believe the thoughts i had for 2 months; Suicidal and murderous/violent thoughts. I was so angry and depressed for so long but Iâ€™m pulling through. I resented everything I ever said to them, my genuine feelings of love being destroyed and wasted on them. 

Considering my mental instability before all of this it was absolutely devastating that they took advantage of my weakness. I almost committed suicide but I only left myself cut up.

Iâ€™m far happier now without that wretch of human being. Im focusing on my job and military career and on the road to recovery :)).

TLDR: I got screwed over by a girl who used me to make them feel better about themselves and for sympathy mining.  I was left mentally scarred and alone.
