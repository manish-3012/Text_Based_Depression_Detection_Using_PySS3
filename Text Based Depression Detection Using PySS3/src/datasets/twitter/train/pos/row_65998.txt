I made a sub for us to have serious discussions I first want to say this is in no way shape or form trying to rival this sub. /r/seriousteens is a sub only for those discussions because I have noticed those types of discussions that are posted in this sub donâ€™t get as much traction as memes. That is fine and I believe the reason for that is because people donâ€™t want those types of topics all the time. This is a sub that you can go to expect to see serious posts. Anyways feel free to join.
