i just kinda wanted to share this to someone but i didnâ€™t know who so i honestly feel like things are getting better- like my mental health sucks, i had a breakdown when i was 14 which i wonâ€™t go into as i donâ€™t wanna trigger anyone, but i recovered and now about a year later i felt my mental health sorta slipping again, but i feel like iâ€™m fixing it for now at least. 

so basically me and my boyfriend (who has helped loads too) have been learning to skate which has been fun coz not only am i exercising but i actually enjoy it and it motivates me to go out and do stuff. ive also started enjoyed art again (i used to draw and paint all the time but the fun was lost when exam work began) and idk just looking after myself better. iâ€™ve gotten more comfortable with my sexuality too, and after quarantine i was just kinda like â€˜fuck it imma not careâ€™ lmao

iâ€™m sorry if this seems like iâ€™m trying to make some people jealous but i just donâ€™t have anywhere to share this and i donâ€™t have a journal or anything because itâ€™s packed to move house haha. i know the phrase â€˜it gets betterâ€™ is super cliche and patronising but honestly it does, it might be really hard but it does, and remember recovery doesnâ€™t have to be a complete shift, you can still have bad days and weeks and months, just take your time and look after yourself as best you can â™¡ï¸Žâ™¡ï¸Žâ™¡ï¸Žâ™¡ï¸Ž

if anyone wants me to delete this or something i will aha i donâ€™t mind at all :)
