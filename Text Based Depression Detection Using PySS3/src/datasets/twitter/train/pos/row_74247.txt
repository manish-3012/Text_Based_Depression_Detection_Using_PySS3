I have no social skills. I think during the lockdown I lost the ability to speak to people that arenâ€™t close friends because I can hang out with friends and talk to them comfortably but thatâ€™s about it ( and family I forgot to mention). I was at a restaurant last night and I found it hard to talk to the waiter. A few weeks ago I barely managed to say hi to someone from my class. I had a o get vaccinated a few weeks ago as well but I wasnâ€™t scared of the needles, I was scared of seeing people I knew. Even the people I can talk to, I sometimes realise hours later that what I said was stupid and I shouldnâ€™t have said it. Does anyone know what I can do to stop this happening?
