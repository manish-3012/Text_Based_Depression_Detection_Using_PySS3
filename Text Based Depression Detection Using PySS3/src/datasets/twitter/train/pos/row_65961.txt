holy fuck I just snapped my crush and my hearts boiling Backstory: so we met in december and talked for a good month. Then i got kinda clingy and was upset when she was dry with me so I said something stupid like 'ig u hate me now" and she lashed out. She also said shes dealing with major depression and she cant have proper convos and shit

She basically said some ppl have shit to go through and i got a big ass lecture and she was like "bye" and i was lie no no pls dont leave me im so sorry, i was just overthinking this...etc

In the end well you know, i told her ill leaver her alone and she said "ok bye"

Fast forward 4 days, I decided to text her with an apology paragraph, and i think she appreciated it. She told me she'll text me in a couple of days to see when we'll talk again so i was soo happy to hear that.

But she didn't. 

It's been almost two weeks now, lol. 

So just now i was casually telling my friend i miss my crush and told her what happened and she told me to SNAP HER RIGHT NOW. Im like wait fr i should even tho she lied?

shes like yes do it. Idk, in the heat of moment i got the courage and i actually fucking snapped her.

I said "hey i wanna check in to see how your doing" and i turned off my phone bc im shaking.

AHHHHH
