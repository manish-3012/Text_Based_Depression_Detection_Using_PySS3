Hi guys! Mom here with a question about online privacy. Would love your thoughts. Hi all! Iâ€™m a step-mom to a 15 year old girl. (Her mom passed away when she was very young so I am a little more than just a stepmom.)

Iâ€™m posting this because Iâ€™m conflicted and Iâ€™d like your take on something. We have given our daughter pretty much free reign on all of her devices. We do have some time limits set but they are pretty generous. Anyway, she came to me recently and told me she met up with a man she met on discord who was in his thirties. She said they didnâ€™t have sex but they did other stuff. Obviously I was devastated that something like that happened to her. We immediately went to police and theyâ€™re investigating. She is also in therapy. (She was in therapy before this happened too.)

So I guess my question is this: how much would you hate your parents if they used a monitoring type service like Bark if something like this happened to you? I feel like she clearly isnâ€™t mature enough to realize when a predator is grooming her and Iâ€™m sick thinking about something like this ever happening again. If something like this happened to you, would you understand your parents monitoring your online activity for a while?
