I just caught a pedophile. So, a bit of backstory, I, a male, was scrolling through Instagram, when I found a new account that was basically a way to send an anonymous message to another Instagram account, specifically a love message, to your crush.

With this knowledge at hand, I got one of my friends and decided to make an account with a female name, and a female's profile picture, and sent to that anon messages account basically a love message to send to one of my friends, just to fuck with him.

All that happened, and me and my friend decided to keep this a secret until the right time comes, then reveal it to my other friend that we made the account to mess with, so, rather than deleting the account, I kept it.

Fast forward almost a week, and I get a message from this guy, a 20 year old man, on the throwaway joke account, (keep in mind in the bio of my fake account I stated that the girl would be 15 years old).

The messages were not normal by any means, he started to send me messages like that he wants to get to know me, my name, ect, I gave him fake information that is authentic to my throwaway account, then he started sending me pictures of himself, I'm waiting for him to send me something weird, I'm leading him on to believing I'm a actually a 15 year old female, and then fuck him up, sadly I can't report him to authorities, he lives in another country, but my game plan is to mess him up mentally, once he thinks I'm actually into him, I'll reveal my final chess move, and fuck him up.
