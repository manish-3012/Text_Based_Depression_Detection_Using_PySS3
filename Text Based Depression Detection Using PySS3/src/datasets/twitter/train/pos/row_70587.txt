STOP BELIEVING EVERYTHING. TOMATO TOWN MASACRE DIDN'T HAPPEND I generally doubt that tomato town masacre happend. Not only its unlikely that kid himself took out 5 squads just after landing with his friend down. As the story says they went to The south and end up in pleasant park when clearly pleasnt park is to the west of tomato town so its very unlikely that tomato town massacre actually happend or atleast it was exagurated
Also worth noting that later his friend ask for HP. That implies that they didn't find Jug and Bondages in the pleasant park and tomato town after looting it all which is statistically speaking inpossible. [Math time] tomato town has 12 bulding. Each building has 7 spots of loot on average+ pleasant park has around 20 loot spots. Chance of healing item spawning is 6,5%. Chance of shield spawning is 6,5% too. That measns they had 13% chance to find any heals which they didn't while looting (12Ã—7)+20=104 items. They should've find 13 heals and atleast 1 Chug Jug. Which they didn't. And as ridiculous as it is they still got #1 Victory royal without Shields and with low HP. Which is impossible because even the best player in the world (Ninja fortnite) wasn't able to do it. That implies that this kid is better that the best player?! This story is defenatly fake.
