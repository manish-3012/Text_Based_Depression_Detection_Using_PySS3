To the person who really neads to hear this Hey I'm posting this because I really had the urge to post this the whole day long
So to the person reading this, that has a  thought emotionally time right now this post is just for you
If you feel that just the whole universe is against you, don't worry because there is someone that loves and supports you even someone that you might not know.
I know it sounds weird but my dad is an alcoholic and I had some thought times.. Lucky there was someone that supported me and my dad is slowly getting "better"
So what I basically mean is that no matter what, pleaseee do not give up hope because you have a special place in this world. If you feel suicidal or just having a bad day don't give up hope.. One thing that helped me cope is thinking of a "happy place"
If you want to talk to someone or feel to shy to tell someone, feel free to dm me on the reddit chat box
Even if this post helped just one person it would make my day! And remember don't give up hopeâ™¥ï¸
