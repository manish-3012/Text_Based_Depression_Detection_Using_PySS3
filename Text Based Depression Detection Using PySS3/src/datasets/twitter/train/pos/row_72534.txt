Rare &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Medium/Well Done TL;DR If you eat well done beef you're too far gone to return to caveman  


For any kind of beef, I want it to bleeeed when I bite into it. I want to hear it moo when I chomp into that burger, or cut that steak. If its not pink when I bite into it its overdone imo. I'm glad my dad likes rare beef as well. I may not return to monke today, but I sure as hell am returning to caveman.
