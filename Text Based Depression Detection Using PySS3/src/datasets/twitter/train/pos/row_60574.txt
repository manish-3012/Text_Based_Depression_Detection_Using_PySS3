Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was a period of currency instability in Zimbabwe that, using Cagan's definition of hyperinflation, began in February 2007. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent month-on-month, 89.7 sextillion percent year-on-year in mid-November 2008.[1]

In April 2009, Zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, with currencies from other countries being used.[2] In mid-2015, Zimbabwe announced plans to have completely switched to the United States dollar by the end of that year.[3]

In June 2019, the Zimbabwe government announced the reintroduction of the RTGS dollar, now to be known simply as the "Zimbabwe dollar", and that all foreign currency was no longer legal tender.[4] By mid-July 2019 inflation had increased to 175%, sparking concerns that the country was entering a new period of hyperinflation.[5][6] In March 2020, with inflation above 500% annually, a new taskforce was created to assess currency issues.[7][8] By July 2020 annual inflation was estimated to be at 737%.[9]
