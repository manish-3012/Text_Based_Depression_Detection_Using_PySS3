A girl has been checking me out for the past 25 minutes idk what to do... I'm at a clothing store (not gonna name) with my parents right now cuz my parents wanted to get new clothes for themselves, there's this girl across from me and she's been checking me out for the past 25 minutes, she looks kinda cute but I don't know... I don't know how to react to this... She's been following us from one corner of the store to the other... It feels a lot more awkward with my parents around... I feel anxious for some reason, and also nervous... How should I react?
