how many times do you eat in a day? i was just wondering what was the average.

I usually eat 3 or 4 times a day depending on if i skip breakfast.
Lately iâ€™ve been trying to eat 2 meals a day (intermittent fasting) to lower my hunger. My weight is healthy for my height (140lbs/65kg for 5â€™8/172cm), I just eat too much and if i ate a little less i think i could have my body goal), i donâ€™t really know if itâ€™ll benefits me in the long run though
