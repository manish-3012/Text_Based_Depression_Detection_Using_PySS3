My grandpa worked until 80 to help pay for my college! My grandpa is well over 80 but he's in extremely good shape He loves walking around helping us move things and being a delight. He used to be In the air Force and was an air boss and he has a bunch of crazy stories from then. He's been working at a hotel for years and years and he's always lived quite modestly. He revealed to me recently that he intends to pay for my college! He says that he's willing and ready to pay like $20, 000 for every 4 years of my college because he sees promise in me! I have been working hard all throughout high school and have gotten straight A's every year, and now as a senior I've been very worried about how  I am going to pay for college bc My family's not very wealthy and I have a single mom with nothing saved. But now apparently I don't have to worry! My grandpa has never been well off and this wasn't his responsibility at all, But he was working So hard all of these years because he wanted to see me go to college and I wanted to share that!
