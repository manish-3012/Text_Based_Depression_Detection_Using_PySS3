Iâ€™m tired of women My trust has been toyed with and I have a twisted perception of love. Added some girl and we were talking, it was pretty clear we liked each other. One day she doesnâ€™t talk to me at all, get a text that night â€œbyeâœŒðŸ¼â€ then she blocks me.  Iâ€™m just giving this one specific instance because it literally just happened, but worse has happened.

Edit: Iâ€™m not like coming on here to cry Iâ€™m just laughing at myself that Iâ€™m not even upset or frustrated just disappointed
