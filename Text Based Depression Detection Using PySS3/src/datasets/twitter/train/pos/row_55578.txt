Suggest me albums or bands :) So I already kinda posted this but I didnt specify what genres I was looking for. So uhh I like grindcore, sludge/sludgecore, beatdown hardcore, death metal, stoner doom/doom, powerviolence, goregrind, metalcore to some extent, deathcore etc... 

So yeah drop a band/album/ep recommendation :)) I can give reccs back too if you want
