I feel like kicking someone's balls should not be normalized I'm not trying to start another gender war here both genders are cool. I try to be a gentleman and I would never just punch a girls tits because I would probably get suspended from school and alot of people would hate me. But when a girl trys to kick my nuts I literally have no idea what to do and I dont tell anyone because I dont want to feel like a baby. I feel like this is literally sexual harassment what the heck do I do
