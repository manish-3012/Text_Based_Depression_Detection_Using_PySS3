I really like a girl Iâ€™ve known her forever. Weâ€™ve been friends because of our parents friendship with each other for many years.

This past summer we both stayed at my dads and his girlfriend (her moms house) and weâ€™ve really started to hang out a lot. Like weâ€™d go to the lake together, go to Starbucks, play video games, and stay up together where sheâ€™d stay in the furnished basement with me. (Both of us in separate air mattresses). 

This weekend was the first time Iâ€™ve seen her since July and I enjoyed my time with her. Even last night she went up to bed but came back downstairs just to spend more time with me. (I go back to college and she went back to her dads). 

We share so many interests and I love being around her. Sheâ€™s so pretty and I just wish I knew how she felt.
