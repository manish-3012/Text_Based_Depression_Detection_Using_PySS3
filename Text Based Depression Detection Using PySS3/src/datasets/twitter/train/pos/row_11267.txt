My mom told me to choose between the class trip or a PS5 Ok lol so my mom isn't so keen on sending me to the end of high school trip with my class because she doesn't like the other mom who's gonna be our guardian and because of the pandemic, so I told her hey, what if those $500 are used for a PS5 instead? She was pleased with that and told me the choice is mine, so I have to tell her which one by tomorrow. Yes the PS5 will be the best investment out of the two but I've been getting pretty ripped working out for 2 years, so I don't want it going to waste either. Anyways I'm terrible at making decisions like this xd, could you give me some advice?
