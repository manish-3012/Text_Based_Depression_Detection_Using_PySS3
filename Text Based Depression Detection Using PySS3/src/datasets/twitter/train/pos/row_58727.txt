Have you ever looked in the mirror and think all you are is worthless trash? I'm gettin that right now. I few things I do I can't even do right this past week, and I feel like shit. Complete and utter garbage. 

Why should people like me? Do people even like me? Is everybody I've ever known secretly only my friend out of pity? Will my mental state ever return to where it was before COVID? Why can't I just be responsible?

And these questions and more will be answered... one day. And I hope they will be positive. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
