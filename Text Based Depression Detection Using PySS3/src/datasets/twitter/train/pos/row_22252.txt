iâ€™m kinda tired of being insulted or whatever just for being American. iâ€™m also tired of being stereotyped for being American. so what if iâ€™m american? iâ€™m not the typical radical conservative or liberal. iâ€™m not talking about this sub particularly but i just felt like i needed to let tjis out. no one should have to be ashamed of what country they come from. the negative comments iâ€™ve gotten every once in a while have sorta made me this way. i donâ€™t hate america but i feel like i just wanna move out because it seems being an american citizen is a bad thing now. Iâ€™ve been taking great interest in Canada, although i feel i would rather go to my (one of my, in dual heritage) country of Panama for the sake of being with my family. sure itâ€™s not the best country on earth but no country is perfect. and nobody makes fun of me for being panamanian. 

and personally i feel that if someone likes america they shouldnâ€™t be attacked or hated for it. america isnâ€™t tje worst country in the world. it has its problems liek Canada, Algeria, Mexico, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Russia, Japan, Pakistan, Kenya, Bhutan, Colombia, New Zealand. The list goes on and every country has its problem. iâ€™m tired of being hated for who i am and where i live.
