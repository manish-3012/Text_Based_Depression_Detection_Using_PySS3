I donâ€™t understand the â€œwhite people canâ€™t face racismâ€ argument, can anyone who believes this explain what this means? I completely agree itâ€™s barely a problem, compared to  the racism experienced by other races, however Iâ€™ve never seen an argument that isnâ€™t about how white people donâ€™t experience systemic racism, but racism and systemic racism are two different concepts, racism being on a person to person level, while systemic racism is the POC having less systemic power, and having systems in place that hold them back. Can anyone explain how racism on a person to person is unable to effect white people?
