How does he even do that My friend has like at least 5+ girls from just our class going after him, like it's really clear they want him, but he just legit can't see it smh, like even the girls he doesn't usually talk to after he has like a race or something (he's running) are like "Oh yeah *insert name* how was it, how did it go" etc. And not in the way in which you'd just ask to be polite, you can clearly just look at them and see that they're into him
