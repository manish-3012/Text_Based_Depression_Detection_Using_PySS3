School is sucking me dryyyyyy My mom said I looked dead earlier, cuz I have the purple-ish rings under my eyes. This is weird, cuz Iâ€™ve been getting decent sleep (7-9)hrs. Iâ€™m so not ready for this weekend. I have to do two projects, and study for all my finals next week. One or two are on Monday. 

I also have a math test tomorrow, and had a bio lab and test retake this morning. 

I donâ€™t even have time to workout with my rowing team, or talk with my friends. 

I just want this next week to go quickly, so I can get back to workouts, video games, and friends. I hate this shit. 

Mentally, Iâ€™m fine, Iâ€™ve been through worse. Iâ€™m just TIRED. for all of those who are going through similar or are pushing through this last week, just know uâ€™ve got this. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk that Iâ€™ll regret posting in a couple hours.
