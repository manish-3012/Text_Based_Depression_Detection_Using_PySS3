I had a weird ass dream.  So at first, the dream started off pretty odd. Me and an alfakyn, or elf, were trying to get married. And I don't mean a santa elf, I mean a six-foot-something magic-wielding tech-assisted Legolas-style woman elf that could probably vaporize me with nothing but her mind. Oh, and she was also the Elf equivalent of police. Yah. Started off with a weird-ass blending of cultures that was just gonna get weirder. First, a cave had to be dug in the side of a mountain very distant, surrounded by swamp, while ringed with fog. Took all in-dream night but it got finished. Then there was a small gathering and a bear was there. Again, don't question it, the dream alfakyn do some weird shit. Mix magic and tech in one society and we'll see where you end up. Following that, there was a feast to be followed by a short ceremony, and of course ***half the guests are from star wars***. I saw Admiral Akbar, Obi-Wan, and a dozen other planetary governors from a dozen timelines. There was even one planet that didn't even exist in the star wars universe, but apparently the star wars people were familiar enough with it. And guess what? The result was a fucking mess of politics, between the Admirals and the planetary governors and the one Jedi. I'm pretty sure Akbar got in a shouting match with the governor of one of the various planets out there over god-knows-what. I eventually just said "Fuck it, why did we invite all of these people," stormed out and took a walk, and after a convenient amount of dreamtime, returned, and they were still arguing with the governor of one planet that hates artificial ceremonial dishes, but doesn't mind other shit being artificial. Then I woke up.
