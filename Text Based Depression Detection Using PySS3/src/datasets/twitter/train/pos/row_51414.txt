axe fkn body spray iâ€™m a junior in highschool. 16 and 17 year olds. this kid walks in my class, and RIGHT as he steps through the door iâ€™m slammed in the face with the overwhelming stench of axe. of course he sits two desks away from me so my head is currently pounding. and yes, iâ€™m wearing a mask. I THOUGHT WE LEFT AXE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL BRUH AT LEAST GET SOME OLD SPICE OR SOMETHING EVEN SLIGHTLY LESS OBNOXIOUS.
