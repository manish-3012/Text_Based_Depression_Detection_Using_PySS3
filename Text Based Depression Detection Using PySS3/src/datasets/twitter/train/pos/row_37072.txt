My dudes think I am gay...  So me and the bros are playing on our PS4s. You know, just chilling talking and playing some video games. Until one of the boys brings up that he's going to ask out one of our classmates ( who is a girl) and we are kind of laughing about how we thought this might end up. He was all like "Nah boys, just watch next week in front of everyone i am gonna ask ______ out. So after this, we start talking about girls. You know the dude talk. Man like Belle Delphine and some shit. Then I remember that earlier today I was scrolling through Twitter and someone retweeted a picture of spider monarch, so I didn't know that he is a boy. I was like "hey I just found this person on Twitter who is named spider monarch". Shes lowkey pretty radical dadical. That's when one of my friends said "That's a boy, you gay AF". Thats when i say "Bro quit fucking with me". "BRO TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT HIS PROFILE. Gay ass". And to my horror, i saw the words "E-boy" and my heart sunk. I thought to myself: Fuck.... it's the end, the boys gon think im gay. They then took turns calling me gay. Ngl, not my proudest fap. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay.

TLDR: I thought that a E boy was an E girl. I called E boy "Radical Dadical". One of the boys recognized that name and told me that Spider Monarch was a dude. They called me gay af.
