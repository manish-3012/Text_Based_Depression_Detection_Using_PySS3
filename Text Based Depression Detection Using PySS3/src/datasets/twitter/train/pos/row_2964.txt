My current greatest love that I had just broke me This is a thing I made on why I liked her and the last part is added just now

 

She was the one with the idea to date, she made the first move. Itâ€™s always a great thing when the other makes the first move because half the job is done I guess. â€œSomeone whoâ€™s smart, pretty, has her glasses just a little crooked ya know someone who doesnâ€™t go for a guy like meâ€ (Scout talking about Ms. Pauly) Sheâ€™s different in a good way by making me get butterflies, we always have a laugh and shooting the shit (pardon for language) we interact like Iâ€™ve never seen before. From all that Iâ€™ve observed and all that Iâ€™ve done myself Iâ€™ve never had the kind of interactions we have. She isnâ€™t the most stable person but then again who the hell is, Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™m not always. Sheâ€™s more human i guess, sheâ€™s kinda country and she has that way, I donâ€™t know how to describe it because its never been in my life before. She makes me just smile, I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s what love really is because itâ€™s always subjective but if I care about someone as much as to write why I feel this way and offer myself to contribute to their furthering of their happiness then maybe thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s just too bad she doesnâ€™t see me this way because, I feel like if she took steps to get herself to happiness and I felt she was happier with me because she had the calm she wanted and she just seemed more open and happy with us together. I just want her to be happier and for her to give us another shot.

No one has made me feel this impacted by such a loss no ex has made me feel so well, shitty, maybe the alcohol didnâ€™t help that evening and the massive hangover the next day, but (sorry) God damn do I wanna change her happiness and us. I want us to have both the emotion and our friendship, where we can cuddle and laugh at a literal bucket of chicken, when we can talk about sex and then make fun of me having an erection from talking about it. It isnâ€™t possible though at least before she is happy again.

I know she said yes because she wanted to make me happy and she wasnâ€™t as happy as she wanted, I wanted to make her happy and I was pretty happy, I wasnâ€™t sure why that is but I just think its because of her mental stuff which i canâ€™t fix, Iâ€™m not Hercules (I think you mean Hunkules) Iâ€™m not a god, I wish I could help but sometimes I can only listen. But she sometimes wonâ€™t want me to listen because of her boundaries. Her boundaries are what I guess bug be about our new change, not the sexual boundaries, but the emotional boundaries that are reset due to the mental hospitalâ€™s somewhat manipulation (I hate using this word so sorry), but convincing her that, us was bad (Bad grammar)

She likes another guy now, which just broke me, Iâ€™m crying in my bed right now and feeling just sick in my chest and stomach and it just sucks, I just want to end it and think to myself â€œwho the fuck caresâ€ and I know people will I just sometimes wish someone would ask me about this whole thing.
