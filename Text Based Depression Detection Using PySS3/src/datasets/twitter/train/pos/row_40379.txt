Why do girls say that personality matters above looks to them when looking for a partner when it's a lie No matter how many time girls say it I've seen almost no instances of bad looking guys getting with good looking girls because they have a good personality. I wouldn't even be mad about this if every girl didn't shove this lie at us.
