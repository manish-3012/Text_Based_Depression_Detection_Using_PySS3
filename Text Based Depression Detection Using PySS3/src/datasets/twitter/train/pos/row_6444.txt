Something that i do everyweek. I'll just go to a random art subreddit and sort it in new and give my free weekly award to someone with less appreciated work just to make their day happy. Getting awards for their hardwork makes people so happy. I jumped out of happiness when i got my first award in reddit. As long as you live, Be nice and try to make others happy.
