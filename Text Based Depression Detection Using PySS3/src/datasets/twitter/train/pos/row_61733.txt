i am really confused right now. ever since i came out as pansexual, ive been thinking more and more to myself that i like people the same gender as me sexually, but not romantically.  now, im believing that im gay, but go on dates and go to dinner with girls.  i just dont feel a sexual attraction to them.  can someone help me on this?
