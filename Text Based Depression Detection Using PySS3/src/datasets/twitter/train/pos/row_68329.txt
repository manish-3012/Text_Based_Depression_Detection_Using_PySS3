Making fun of addicts is bad People who look at drug addicts, alcoholics, porn addicts, etc and go like "haha look at this loser that does nothing with their life" are terrible people
You really think being condescending helps anyone? 
TRY TO HELP
I know trying to help doesn't always work but atleast you can say you tried and weren't an asshole about it
