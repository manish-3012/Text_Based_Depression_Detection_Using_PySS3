Today I experienced a strange new feeling (definitely not related to relationships) I am currently preparing for law entrance exams to enter a premier law institute of my country. I have a great interest in in international relations between countries, conflicts, genocides, power struggles and revolutions along with civil wars. I am studying almost 10-13 hrs a day yet I am anxious and nervous and worried all the time because it always seems like I am not doing enough considering that my future would literally depend upon this exam which will be conducted in May. I see one set of questions I cannot do an I freak out, I start breaking down.

I have a 10 year plan which is : 5Years in BA LLB Hons, 2 years job in a law firm for a more solid background, 3 years LLM in international arbitration law and then becoming an international arbitration lawyer.


The thing is I didn't knew much of the scope in the field, but today I came to know about a person who is doing literally what is my goal, my aim, basically my dream. So she is like my role model.

The new feeling which I experienced from it was something like this:

Some sort of immense joy and gladness almost immediately followed by the glim fear of failure, the horror if I fail even at a single step. This feeling is continuing in cycles and I think I am going mad.

That's it, thank you for reaching this far
