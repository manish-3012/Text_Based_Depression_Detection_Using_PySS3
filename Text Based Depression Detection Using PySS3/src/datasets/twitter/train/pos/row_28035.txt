Dedicated to all the guys on this sub that want a gf Heres my 2 cent opinion on all of ur posts here sayin ur lookin for a gf.First of all,why dont u get out into the real world and start talkin to actual girls,imma pretty sure that u might find the right girl by just talkin to them like a regular person.Secondly,dont be a simp.Treat the girl like an equal but dont let her walk all over you.Know your worth and act accordingly.Third,sure u may get to know some ppl through reddit and some guys hv even found their life partners here.So,trying ur luck here is perfectly fine but posting on here every day with almost tge same post isnt gonna get you anywhere



Anyway thats all i wanted to say,i wish u luck in finding a life partner but if u just wanna get laid,just wank it off or pay a prostitute(pls wear a goddamn condom if you do)
