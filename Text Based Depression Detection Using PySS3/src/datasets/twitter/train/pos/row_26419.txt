Should I get Minecraft PE? I have never played Minecraft in my life, so I don't know if it's good.  My friends want to play and I don't want to feel left out, but like, the game is also $7 so I don't know.  I'm also worried that it won't work.  Most of them will probably play on console and I don't know how the cross platform works.  My phone's an Android, so will that work with ps4s or iphones?



Thank you for your replies.
