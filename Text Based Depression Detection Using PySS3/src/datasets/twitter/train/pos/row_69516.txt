Am i the only one who hates Christmas I dont like Christmas it might seem wierd but hear me out. Its just a time of year where you try to get the cheapest thing for some1 and make jt seem like itâ€™s worth more,i know you are supposed to spend it with your loved ones i mean i dont really spend Christmas with anyone apart from my mum,dad,brother so if someone says itâ€™s about spending time with your loved ones please kindly go fuck ur self in the ass i spend all year with my family.

The atmosphere is too thick no one really knows what to do. 
You feel bad if you get a really good present and you gave something shity to them.

Ik itâ€™s supposed to be to celebrate birthday of jesus but im atheist so dont try that either 

Any1 hates Christmas aswell?
