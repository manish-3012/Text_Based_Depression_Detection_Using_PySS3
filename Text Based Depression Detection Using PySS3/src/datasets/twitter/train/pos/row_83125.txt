itâ€™s ridiculous that people expect others to ALWAYS be nice in online arguments. sure being polite is better in MOST cases. if someone starts being incredibly mean over a little issue thatâ€™s dumb. 

BUT if someone is being being sexist/racist/homophobic, and the other person response includes insults or something, especially if that person is a part of the group the person is being bigoted towards, and you start attacking them for being rude instead of the person whoâ€™s being a sexist/racist/homophobe, thatâ€™s  also dumb.

you canâ€™t expect someone to be nice to someone else who is trying to argue that theyâ€™re less then because of things they canâ€™t control.
