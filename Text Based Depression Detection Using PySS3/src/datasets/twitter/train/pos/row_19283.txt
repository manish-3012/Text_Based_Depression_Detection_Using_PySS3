I think my friend might have killed herself She hasnâ€™t been in school since the beginning of last year after she tried to kill herself she tried texting me in March but I ignored it and I donâ€™t know why she wonâ€™t respond to texts and the number is gone sheâ€™s been cutting herself I this is probably my fault I didnâ€™t respond to her texts even though I was one of her only friends I think Iâ€™m gonna cry.
