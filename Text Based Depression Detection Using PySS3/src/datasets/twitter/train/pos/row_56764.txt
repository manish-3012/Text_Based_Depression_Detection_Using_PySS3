The easily digestible layers of irony 0- I am being sincere and truthful (normal talking)

1- I'm DeFiNiTeLy BeInG sInCeRe (sarcasm)

2- Am I actually sincere? Yes (being serious in a sarcastic tone)

3- Am I being sincere? Even I don't know. (confused yet also sarcastic in saying it)

4-Haha I know whether I'm sincere or not and you don't (assholeish and instigating yet also sarcastic)

I go up to 3 normally speaking, and past 4 when I want to really confuse people
