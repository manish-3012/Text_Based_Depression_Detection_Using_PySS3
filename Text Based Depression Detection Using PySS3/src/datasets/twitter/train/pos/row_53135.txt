anyone else think its kinda creepy and weird when people post their text messages here? idk maybe its just me but when someone posts like the ss of their crush saying yes/no or their parents being weird it just feels... too personal? i cant ever imagine me sharing my *private* messages to other people besides the person im texting, let alone literal strangers on the internet.

and im sure if that person ever found out you shared that personal message to others theyâ€™d probably at the very least be uncomfortable, probably even mad. it just feels odd. no hate tho, you can do whatever you want, but i get this feeling like im invading someoneâ€™s privacy when i see a text posted on this sub.
