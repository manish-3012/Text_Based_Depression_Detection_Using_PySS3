Vent post. Possible suicide note. Nothing really matters anymore, does it? My only friend is in quarantine, my brother just died. I've got nothing left in my life apart from pretending to study but actually just rubbing salt into the wound. I'm tired of hiding behind things beyond my control. Everyone thinks I'm happy since my school claims that I'm "The funny kid" . They just don't know what humor is. I don't want to live anymore. I have nothing left. I don't want to be happy, i just don't want to hate myself.
