Hello guys, It's me again. Last 2 posts were about Riley and surprisingly I'm feeling way better. I just saw a dream, it's important if you are following the timeline. So yeah, last night I prayed, then asked God to tell me what to do and where to go and for guidance in for my dream.   


I then my dream, yes it made a difference I saw Riley in the dream, she was having fun alone and I didn't mind and she still was who she was her personality and everything was same. Then we were just friends in that dream and she acted like just we did before the confession.   


Yes then I found someone, my parents were also in that dream. I saw that girl a lot of times in that dream before with I think one of my friends and I was so confused when he left her sad and depressed. she was crying so I went up to her and said "what happened" she told something along the lines of blackmailing and insecurities.   


After being so fucking confused I literally just sat by her, I couldn't see her sad and I was like no this shit ain't happening and I just sat by her and she looked over and said "please help" I said "I'm always here to help mate" she starting to lean towards me and me being an absolute fuckin maniac kissed her and she kissed me, YES I made her cheat on her "bf". The thing was she wasn't happy with him and he left her. So basically I was there and then I had to find or do something for and I got straight to it.   


I can feel that kiss, literally it's still here, that feeling.
