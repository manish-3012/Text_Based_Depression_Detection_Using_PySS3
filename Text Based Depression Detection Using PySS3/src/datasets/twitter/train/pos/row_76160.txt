I hate online school and feel like dying ðŸ˜­ My grades have never been this low, and I've been missing assignments left and right. My parents aren't helping and are super mad at me and I have no idea on how to manage my time. I'm currently in a room in the dark all alone studying cause I am so mad at myself as I have always been a good student and it feels terrible to do bad reddit please help me out. I think I'm going insane
