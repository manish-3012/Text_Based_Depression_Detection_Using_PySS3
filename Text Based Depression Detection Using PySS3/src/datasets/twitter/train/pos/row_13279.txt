Is this weird? I was put into a zoom group with this one girl to discuss class content. We got along really well and sheâ€™s super pretty. Weâ€™re both math majors. 

Now I canâ€™t stop staring at her in zoom class. I havenâ€™t had a crush since middle school. 


Is this what it feels like? What the fuck do I do?
