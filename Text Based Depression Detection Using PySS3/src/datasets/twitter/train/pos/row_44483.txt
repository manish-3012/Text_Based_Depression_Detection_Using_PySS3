Curse - my take on how I feel pretty much every day The feeling of constant loneliness remains regardless of who or how I interact with others. Itâ€™s the cold hand on my back that makes me put on this jacket of barriers. Guilt blankets me while I try to sleep, hindering my ability to so. Itâ€™s like fighting a boxer without any fighting experience; you wouldnâ€™t try to win; youâ€™d try to get out of that situation. Itâ€™s the lack of a lightbulb in my spotlight that lets jealousy sneak in without being noticed. Thatâ€™s the curse. Itâ€™s a storm of feelings that hit you in the face like a brick tossed by a tornado. The damage of said brick is what you want to avoid. The goal is to dodge the bricks and get as far away as possible from the storm. Though, thatâ€™s not possible, itâ€™s an endless cycle of storms, one after another. Occasionally, I find myself in the eye; the calm, brickless space I like to call happiness. No matter how much I would like for it to be permanent, the eye constantly moves, eventually moving away from me. Youâ€™d have to accept the curse, though. Itâ€™s never going to give you mercy or any thoughts of freedom. Itâ€™s the inevitable consequence for poor progress on mental health improvement. Itâ€™s like the big bang theory, except itâ€™s not a theory in this case. All of it is the result of three events that occurred in a similar timeframe. Itâ€™s a law; the structure of my thoughts and feelings. A ladder of snakes; it isnâ€™t sturdy, and you risk getting severely injured if you decide to climb it. The storms, ladders, bricks, and even just the feelings themselves, are unfortunately, the fundamentals to who I am as of this moment in time.
