I'm really sad rn I haven't really felt that happy in a long time, i used to only feel happy on my birthday because that was when people actually seemed to notice me, but since last year that hasn't felt any different to a normal day. At this point the only reason why I haven't talked to anyone previously about this is because people who (for some reason) actually care about me would be concerned for me and for some reason I don't want that. But even now I'm only really saying this because i just want to let it out. I'll probably sleep it off again now.
