I kind of want to reach out to a guy that Iâ€™ve always kind of liked. Iâ€™ve talked to him a handful of times in person, and Iâ€™ve always enjoyed his company.

We both just got out of super duper long term relationships, and we both just got cheated on.

I donâ€™t want to flirt with him necessarily, but I feel like we could possibly heal from our experiences together I guess?

I donâ€™t know what I should do, but I canâ€™t get this guy off of my mind for whatever reasonðŸ˜‚.

Should I reach out to him?
