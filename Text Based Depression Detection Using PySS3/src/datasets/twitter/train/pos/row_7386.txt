I wish I was a monkey Like do you think monkeys pay tax or give a fuck about grades or have to get financially stable?
No theyâ€™re fucking monkeys! Sometimes I wish life just consisted of swinging from tree to tree cracking open yellow ones with the boys and eating babies, is that too much to ask for!
