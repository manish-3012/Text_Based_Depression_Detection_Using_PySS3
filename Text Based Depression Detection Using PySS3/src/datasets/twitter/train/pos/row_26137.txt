small rant about sex and gender difference it bugs me when nonbinary are like â€œim not male or femaleâ€ when those arenâ€™t even genders, those are sexes. (i am nonbinary, im not just hating on them for no reason) sex is genetic and canâ€™t be changed but gender is just a social construct. being nonbinary means youâ€™re neither a boy/man nor a girl/woman (the generic genders)

and also it bugs me when people donâ€™t include nonbinary as trans. trans doesnâ€™t mean MtF or FtM, it just means youâ€™re not cisgender (the gender you were born with, boy or girl) so i can be a MtNB trans person

ps: complain all you want that im ruining your day by talking about the lgbt and â€œpushing it on youâ€ but im damn tired of seeing posts of people asking their crush out
