I really dont know what to study. Im so confused. Ever since we got to study from home, all my grades went down as far as almost to the C. I used to have all As and all but now its either B- or C. Whenever i tried to study all i can think of is "this is not what we study before" and "did i do my Language assignment, wait no i havent did my P.E one" and i ended up not studying and not completing the assignment. 

I just, i REALLY dont know what are we studying and what are we going to study. Its very confusing and very not cool. I just dont know man. Whenever i study, example im exercising on the physics i just dont know what Unit and Sub-Unit to study. 

Tommorow is Mid-Semester term and i didnt bother to study even though my parents said i should study or i will lose my nose. But the thing is, even when the teacher gave us materials i just DONT KNOW what are we going to study. I re-readed all the textbook, i asked my teachers, i kept opening and closing my notes but it just dont help with my studies and my grades are falling. 

Anyone knows what to do? I cant handle this anymore. I tried making schedule but it is not effective.
