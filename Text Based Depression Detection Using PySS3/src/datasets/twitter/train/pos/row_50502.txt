Why did every girl I've seen this watch laugh in amazement? Why do they find Cassie Cage's "Testi-kill" so awesome? I don't care it's just a video game, that doesn't explain it.  

For those who don't know what I'm talking about:

Just please someone explain it to me. Why does this amuse them so much or cause them so much joy. Why? How is this different from a game where a male character can ram knives specifically into the vaginas of female characters, and that's his "special move", and you see the vagina being destroyed? And then guys laughed at it and found it awesome because "boypower"?
