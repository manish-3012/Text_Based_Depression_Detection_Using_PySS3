I feel really bad and guilty when I donâ€™t like the food my mom makes. This is just a rant and maybe I shouldnâ€™t be upset about this and Iâ€™m a pussy but whatever. My mom cooks A LOT, and sheâ€™s pretty decent at it. And whenever she makes something, sheâ€™s super excited for me to try it. When I try something she makes and I dislike it, I get more sad about telling her than upset about the taste of the food. I love her so much and I hate to reject something she worked really hard on. Sorry for the long ass rant, I just needed to get this out. Iâ€™m wondering if anyone else feels the same as I do.
