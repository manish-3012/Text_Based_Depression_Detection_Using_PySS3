Thank You Thanks to everyone responding to me. It actually makes my day a little less shitty getting to talk to people I donâ€™t really know why I like talking to older people (Iâ€™m 12 but my birthdays on the 13th shut up) and like itâ€™s been pretty cool being a dumbass here. Iâ€™m probably the weirdest 12 year old youâ€™ll ever meet. I donâ€™t look or sound 12, I worship odd future, I love The Weeknd, joji, lil peep and other people like that. I have so many different personalities so thatâ€™s cool, Iâ€™m obsessed with Tyler the creators music and god damn I want my head in between a cute Asian girls thighs. Thatâ€™s all, so like thanks for being social
