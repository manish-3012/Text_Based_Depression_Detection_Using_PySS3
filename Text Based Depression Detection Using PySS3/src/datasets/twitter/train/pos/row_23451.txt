If elected Supreme Emperor of Earth for Life, I will solve both homelessness and joblessness By having giant apartment complexes put up around various parts of the world. They will provide homes for the homeless and the construction jobs alone should more than provide enough job openings for the unskilled laborer.

Also I will make wearing hats mandatory in outdoor public spaces for most days of the week. Not because of any ideological reasons, I just think that hats look nice and more people should were them.
