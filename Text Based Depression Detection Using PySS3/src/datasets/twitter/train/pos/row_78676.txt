Guys he likes me back So last night I wrote about my friend and how I have feelings for him and how he said if we ever meet up (he's in denmark, I'm in america) he would want to platonic cuddle (we're both ace for context)

And so I was just talking to him and he likes me and then I said I liked him back and aaaaaaaaa I'm at a basketball game rn because playing in the band (yes covid I know) and I'm blushing so hard I'm afraid someone will notice I am very happy eeeee

Anyway yes that's all I'm so happy
Have a great day
