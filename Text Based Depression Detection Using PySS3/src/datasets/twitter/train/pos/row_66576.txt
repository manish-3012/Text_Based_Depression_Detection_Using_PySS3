Some people on the internet get salty really really fast Sometimes people on the internet get salty really fast, I mean, there's a minor thing that bugs them and they'll be like "THIS THING IS RACIST" or maybe they think the main moral of a story is something unrelated to the plot itself, like Dark Souls someone on the internet thought that it was a metafore for capitalism in 2020 instead it's a game about feeding/ending cycles. And don't even get me started on people who "fix" fictional characters, I mean they're not real they're just a drawing so it doesn't offend anyone (obviously there are some limitation, but still) 

Also, if anyone gets offended then don't scream at me, please
