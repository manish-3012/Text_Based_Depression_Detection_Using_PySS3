No one's really sure how we got to Tennessee from Massachusetts in the summer of 2017, But we do know because of a framed receipt Maddox's mom Has hanging in the guest bathroom of her basement That we somehow ended up stopping at a Jimmy John's in  Cincinnati at 11:23 p.m. The previous Sunday. 

 No one really remembers anything from those few days outside of the receipt that parking ticket and waking up in the dumpster behind a bowling alley owned by a gentleman who looks likes Santa Claus'  Ecstasy addicted 2nd cousin. But he was a nice dude didn't call the cops and even gave us directions to the closest motel that didn't have bed bugs.

 The phone call back home was less than pleasant... The parents still sent us gas money to get back to New England and we'll it was one last lost summer weekend before we all left for college... so yeah
