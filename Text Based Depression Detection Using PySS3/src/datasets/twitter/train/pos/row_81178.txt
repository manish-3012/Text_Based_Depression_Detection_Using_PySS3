it feels like summer idk man it feels like the beginning of quarantine again. ik thatâ€™s because a year has passed but itâ€™s like. i just ate a bag of chips that i exclusively ate all summer and iâ€™m rewarding greyâ€™s and everything is so simple 

lowkey hope school gets cancelled for 6 months again
