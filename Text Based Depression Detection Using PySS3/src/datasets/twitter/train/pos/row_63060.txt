Should I got to the principal if a boy hit my brother? 
To give some back ground info: Basically what happen was some people in my class were talking about someone skipping class (letâ€™s call him R). Right around the time our class was going to end R decided to stroll into the class room saying he was in the â€œnurseâ€™s officeâ€ my brother then proceeded to ask R if he had skipped class out of curiosity. R then proceed to slap my brother on the side of the head so hard the whole class heard the slap. My brother was in complete shock after being hit by a much older boy, his ear was ringing for over 45 minutes, was feeling dizzy and couldnâ€™t concentrate the whole lesson. Of course the teacher didnâ€™t see R slap my brother. At the end of the lesson I was contemplating if I should go to the head master but instead I went to the teacher to tell her. She then proceeded to tell my brother that he should go ask R for a apology and she would talk about it with R. My brother didnâ€™t feel like talking to the boy as it was the last lesson of the day and was scared of the boy as he was much older.

Tomorrow would be Monday and I am thinking if I should go to the principal and talk to him about what has occurred in our classroom. Although my teacher understood what had occurred she just brushed it off as a mistake but canâ€™t see that my brother was hit by another boy in class. I think I will go to the principal but am not sure. 

If this had occurred in a different classroom my other teachers would have took action and sent the older boy to the office.

What do you guys think I should do drop a comment below. Thanks!
