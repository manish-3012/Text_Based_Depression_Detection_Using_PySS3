You guys ever feel like this? I just saw a post on here asking about your favorite video game soundtrack by  [u/Argos\_of\_the\_Embassy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Argos_of_the_Embassy/) and it made me think of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and I still remember how sad the ending was, and I am about to cry despite not having played the game for about 6 years now. I dunno do you guys ever get that wave of sadness from certain things?
