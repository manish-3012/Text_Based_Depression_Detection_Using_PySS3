My mom thought that rabbits laid eggs. I was with my mom getting her car oil changed, and we see a rabbit laying by some rubbish in the area.

My mom and I start talking about the rabbit and stuff while we're waiting until she asks if rabbits lay eggs. I obviously displayed some confusion at this question, and I kid you not, she was dead serious about this. 

Apparently, she thought the Easter Bunny was somewhat rooted in reality and that maybe since the Easter Bunny gave out eggs, that rabbits laid eggs themselves.

This is my *mother*. So that was funny I guess.
