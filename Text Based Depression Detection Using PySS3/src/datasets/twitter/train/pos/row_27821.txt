Shoplifting is so stupid how dumb and poor can ppl be Only time I've ever stole was some underwear at walmart cuz i went and put it on in the restroom. But i wasn't like ohmagod im saving money by stealing them i just didn't care cuz fuck walmart. 

But if i wanted to do it to make money or some shit like why that's so stupid i could make more at home on my computer than wasting my time getting caught doing that shit with stupid greedy companies who track you with cameras so they don't lose 0.000001% of their profit
