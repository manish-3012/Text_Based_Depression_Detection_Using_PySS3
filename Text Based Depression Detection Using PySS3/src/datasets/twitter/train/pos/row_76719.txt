Feeling disphoria and depression. *POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING* So just for some context I'm a biological female but I indentify as non binary. I've been loosing alot of freinds, I had a pretty small freind group (3 people to be exact) and I lost them all so now I'm struggling. One of them was my bff like literary, but he ghosted me and avoids  me at school, witch means I can't hang out with my other friends. Another freind just left me for seemingly no reason same ,with the other guy.
Without the distraction of freinds i have been focusing on my looks/body, circling back to being non binary, I feel like I should have no chest and a large butt, I have some chest and some butt, in reality, I looked fine and I knew that, but if you've got body dismorphia, your never good enough. That plus the freinds was enough to send me into a depressive spiral. I would cry almost every night and feel like I should die. I had a mental breakdown everyone I would see the boy who ghosted me.

Now to the good part. This girl pulled me out of the dark just by being nice and like me,like the old group. I feel a bit better about myself now. I can answer questions in the comments because I'm running out of room
