Hey yall I just want to tell you something Now this is mainly for the americans here, the accent you have does not and i repeat DOES NOT mean you are racist, sexist or homophobic. Its a stereotype and though its a majority of the southerners and midwest people this doesnt define every person there. Same goes for being Catholic or Republican
