Since i turned 13 in March this year, I now took courage to admit that I was never allowed to use reddit Why? Well because reddit TOS says you need to be 13 to use reddit

In November 2019 I created this account as my first reddit account when I used to be to 11

I'm very sorry to the entire reddit for faking my age, well past is past so its okay 

**Right?**
