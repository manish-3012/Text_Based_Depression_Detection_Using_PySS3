Welcome to the new trend of r/teenagers We now have incels vs simps/girls  except surprise surprise the incels arenâ€™t actually incels and the simps arenâ€™t actually simps. Itâ€™s a shitty thing to go up to someone as ask them out then laugh in their face along with all your friends and say itâ€™a just a joke. And after something like that happens to you, itâ€™s not cool to go on Reddit and claim all girls all bad and trash because thatâ€™s not true. If a person rejected you POLITELY, then accept that people have their own personal reasons and preferences and move on with your life. And if you got cheated on, Iâ€™m sorry, that person is shitty and doesnâ€™t deserve your beautiful ass. But donâ€™t go say all people of that gender are bad because it isnâ€™t true. Anyway thatâ€™s it Iâ€™m gonna go eat pizza now
