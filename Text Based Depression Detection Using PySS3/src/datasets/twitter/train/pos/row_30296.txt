Do you guys believe in an afterlife? Idk why but this thought popped into my head last night and I havenâ€™t been able to get rid of it since

Part of me wants to believe in the heaven or reincarnation, because the idea of just not existing freaks me out and Iâ€™d want to see my family/friends again.

But the rational part of me knows that once you die, well youâ€™re probably just dead and nothing happens, there really isnâ€™t a need for anything else. I find this scary, but realistically it really isnâ€™t since you wouldnâ€™t even know you donâ€™t exist.

Sorry if this is overly depressing or I trigger an existential crisis, but Iâ€™m just curious as to what your guys thoughts are?
