I genuinely can not remember the last time I felt happy Iâ€™m always super anxious and on edge and whenever I think too much I start feeling physically sick like Iâ€™m about to throw up and I just donâ€™t see a point in doing anything anymore. No one cares about me and I donâ€™t care about myself either. I work too hard to please everyone and donâ€™t get the same effort back. All of my friends see me as an emotionless brick because my social anxiety makes me horrible at conveying emotions. Everything seems so dark and dull and I canâ€™t find the motivation to do anything that I used to love. I wish I could vent to my friends but I convince myself that they donâ€™t care and that Iâ€™m just wasting their time so Iâ€™m here talking to strangers. Please get this to hot and Iâ€™m only saying that because I want to talk to as many people as possible. Call me a karma whore if you want but I donâ€™t really care about internet points I just want to talk to someone
