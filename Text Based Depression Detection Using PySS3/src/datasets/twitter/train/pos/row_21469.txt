How am I supposed to meet people during Quarantine? I've been seeing a lot of posts about  "how do I get a gf/bf" popping around every now and then, albeit, they're becoming farther and few in between, which is a good thing! And that's not necessarily what this post is about, I'm just looking for somebody new to socialize with, whether or not that leads to anything is all up in the air. That being said, most places are closed now because of quarantine and whatnot, and I can't use any online dating apps as I'm only sixteen, not that they would work regardless, because most people there are just looking for a casual hookup anyways. As for things like discord servers and all that, it's better, but still not quite what I'm looking for. I'm sure there is a server out there that I'd like, but all the ones I've joined up until now just seem... hollow, fake, or even just flat-out uncommunicative. Also, there's no denying that I'm deterred by the fact that I'll likely never even be able to meet any of the people there outside of a voice chat scenario.

With all that being said, is there anything else I can be doing? I know the old saying "beggars can't be choosers" and all that, but I feel like there has to be something else I can do. Quarantine is a bitch, I'm not gonna lie, and it's ruining a lot of things for everybody, I'm hoping that my social life doesn't have to be one of them. I'm generally pretty good with people, and I don't want to let this be another reason that I feel cruddy all the time. So, can you help me out here?
