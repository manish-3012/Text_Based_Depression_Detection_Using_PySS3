How to make a "quality" meme (Part 2) Welcome back to how to make a "quality" meme by u/TAKirbyStar_! I'm gonna teach you how to make a "quality" meme, step by step!

-Step 1: Go to one of these subreddits: "r/rareinsults" "r/murderedbywords" or "r/clevercomebacks"

-Step 2: Use one of the following meme templates: "That's a lot of damage!" "That's quite a bit of damage!" "Holy shit, you fucking killed her, dude!" or "Dead body reported"

This one is a bit shorter, but I hope you get the idea! (I'll be back with Part 3 next Friday, so stay tuned!)
