My little brother said had a friend called Djorka that was tied up in his kindergarten with some thick chains and always whisper him to do bad things My mom asked my aunt (one of the teachers that worked there) and there wasn't anyone called Djorka in the place, but he told my mom that the building before being a kindergarten was a place where people did satanic rituals and that always happened weird shit at night there.
