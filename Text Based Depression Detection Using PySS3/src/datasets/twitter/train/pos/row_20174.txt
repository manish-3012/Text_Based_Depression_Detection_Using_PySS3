My mom doesn't think i have boundaries cause i'm a kid. Me and her have issues and i always wondered what the hell was wrong with her and why she couldn't just chill out, or leave me alone. The older i get, the worse it gets. So i tried talking to her for the 100th time, but we can't have a healthy conversation, she just starts yelling and bringing up things i did from two years ago, to this past week. So, in our conversation i asked her to respect my boundaries, space, and things, then she told me that i don't have boundaries, cause i'm a kid, her kid, and that everything thing that i think is mine, is actually hers, even though everything i have today she didn't buy for me, cause she also tells me to buy my own things even tho i can't get a job right now. She uses it against me that i live under her roof and eat her food, even though that's just the bare minimum. I'm completely fine and happy, but i wish she didn't do shit like taking my school computer away as a punishment (idk why) and then ground me for not doing school work. Its to the point where i don't even remember why i'm grounded, its normally something i did a weeks ago. Anyway, yeah, yall are free to walk all over me now cause i guess i'm just a kid and nothing more.
