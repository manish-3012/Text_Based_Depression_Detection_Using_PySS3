I've watched my first Anime yesterday Yesterday i started and finished Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just this morning I've watched End of Evangelion and i absolutely loved it

I've never been really into Anime,I've tried getting into it but it felt like it wasn't for me. It seemed that some Anime series people recommanded me were too immature for me,just in May i have started watching Movies more often and I've had End of Evangelion in my watchlist for quite a while now.

So i started watching Neon Genesis yesterday and i really didn't think too much of it but as the show progressed it suddenly clicked with me,i was consumed into the story and as the show progressed to it final episodes it more and more felt like each main character had a existential crisis,it was like something else for me.

As for the movie,it one of the most spectacular/weird/beautiful and terrifying movies I've ever seen.
I'm much more of a Movie/Music guy so i approach everything differently and im glad i gave this series and movie a shot.
