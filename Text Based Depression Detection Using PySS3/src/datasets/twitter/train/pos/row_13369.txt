How do you guys deal with the loss of a friend. I had to put my dog to sleep. We've always been together for the past 7 years, He always slept beside me and snuggled up to me when I cried or was upset. I didn't really go to regular high school so he was my only friend for the recent years, my chest feels heavy and i feel so weak and exhausted, all i feel like doing is sleeping at the moment. I'm 16 and he was a 10 year old Maltese that we got when he was 3 years old. i'm not quite sure how to go back to being fine without him. thank you and sorry for any spelling errors.
