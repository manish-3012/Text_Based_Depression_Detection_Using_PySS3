Iâ€™m being sexually assaulted in my own home by my â€œstep-brotherâ€ Iâ€™m a 15 year old heterosexual male and he is he 15 as well. We share a room together. I hate even calling it sexual assault because I know people experience WAY worse things than I have. But it makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I need to rant to someone. 

He makes weird comments. Like â€œdamn you be looking thickâ€ and shit. He walked by one night and goes â€œnice ass [my name]â€. Iâ€™ve told him to stop but he goes â€œItâ€™s just a joke relaxâ€. 

Not to mention the touching. Oh the touching. I need more than two hands to count the amount of times heâ€™s touched me. He spanked me in the rear countless times. I have TOLD him I donâ€™t like it. At all. Heâ€™s said sorry but you know he doesnâ€™t care about it because he will not stop. He constantly will find anyway to make physical contact with me. He will do weird things like pat me on the head and shit which wouldnâ€™t be a big deal without the context. I donâ€™t feel comfortable around him. Not to mention his mother wonâ€™t do squat because she views him as an angel. 

Iâ€™m convinced he has gay feelings for me. Which the problem doesnâ€™t lie in the fact he might be, itâ€™s the lack of respect for my personal boundaries and my comfort in my own â€œhomeâ€. 

Fuck this
