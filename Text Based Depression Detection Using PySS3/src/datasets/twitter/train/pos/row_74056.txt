First day of school today. Iâ€™m doing online school but met my counselor in person yesterday, who told me and my family that â€œas a parent, I donâ€™t think the district will be able to stay open for the rest of the yearâ€ Before and after he said this he clarified a bunch of times that this is his deprecate opinion from the schoolâ€™s. 

Masks are mandatory, but teachers have to wear a plastic face shield instead of a mask. My county has just hit 2000 cases and slowing, but in two weeks I have no doubt it will start to rise again.

Sorry for the unstructured rant. Just, fuck you Utah board of education, fuck you donated trump for getting us into this mess, and fuck you to anyone compliant with this bullshit that has and will get people killed.
