Am I considered white ?? So i'm from Egypt and I'm basically an Arab, my skin color is this beige cookie kinda color but i'm not considered a light skin tho, so the question is... am i WHITE

ps :i'm asking cuz i always see a meme saying white people that and white people this but i don't even relate to that so yes, I'm having an existential crisis
