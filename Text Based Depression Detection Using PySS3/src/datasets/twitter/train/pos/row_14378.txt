aight, so im confused af so basically. im AMAB (assigned male at birth) and i actually use male pronouns as well as female one sometimes. its kinda weird. but here is the thing. im a guy, not a girl or anything else. yet i feel really comfortable with being called a girl and shit. i mean i will actively tell stranger to use she/her just because its more comfortable. yet i am a guy, and i'd never see myself as trans. so basically, what drugs did i take. cause that is some really weird shit im thinking rn.
