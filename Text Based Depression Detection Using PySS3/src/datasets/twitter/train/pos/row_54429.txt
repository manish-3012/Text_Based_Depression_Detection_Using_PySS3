I need advice So my class has 3 kids doing in person, including myself. That means that it's pretty important for us all to be able to get along, or at least be civil. I've been having a lot of trouble with one of them (he joined pretty recently, maybe a month or so ago). The other kid in my class who's been with me the entire year is getting pretty close to him. They've been talking a lot in the afternoon (he only does half days) and kinda icing me out. I know that they're pretty close, and the girl who's been there the whole year is closer to him than she is to me (we're still friends though). This has been causing me a lot of issues. I talked to him today when we where the only people in the room and he told me he "doesn't like my personality". I'm glad he told me so I can stop theorizing about why he's actively not including me, and I don't really know what the next step is. I would really like for all of us to be able to get along. I feel excluded and angry that he's refusing to be civil with me. Help please

tl;dr- a kid in my class told me he doesn't like my personality. there are only three of us so we really need to get along. I don't know what to do
