A long ambiguous rant that I posted on my close friends story and am now posting here Going home strangely didnt help me mentally. Strangely I felt more depressed, lonelier, and confused. Like the first night home I just felt this overwhelming sense of sadness, dread, and self hatred. Idk why I feel this way. I hate that I dont feel happy anymore. I dont know why I feel this way, but its so awful and it's almost like overwhelming. It affects everything. The thing(s) that make me feel the worst I think about on a daily basis. It affects my decisions and even just my social life. Like, when I was at Blacs house a month or so ago. I got so depressed it literally made me feel sick and I literally just had to leave cause I just felt so mentally out of it and sad and I just needed time to myself to just process everything and think. I feel like its holding me back. I feel like it's just this overwhelming shit I'm never gonna overcome and I cant let it out. I have no one to talk to, and I dont even know what to do anymore. I dont even know where I was going with this, I had so much more I wanted to say, but I cant think of what it was i wanted to say

Oh yeah, now I remember something else I wanted to say. Like, I refer to early-mid march and the following couple months of my junior year as being the most depressing period of my life and while things have definitely gotten better, how much better have they gotten? At least I felt justified in feeling the way I did back then. At least I felt okay talking to friends about my problems back then(despite the fact that most didnt even care to reply to my texts)
