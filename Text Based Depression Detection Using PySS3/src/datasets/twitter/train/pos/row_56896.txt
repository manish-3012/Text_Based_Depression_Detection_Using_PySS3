Should i be concerned with the kinda large age difference in my relationship? So I'm 18 and recently I started hooking up with this guy from work. Yeah, that in itself isn't the smartest idea, but it felt right. 

This guy is 25. Is this age gap weird for a friends with benifits relationship? If by whatever chance we catch feelings for each other would it be weird for me to date a 25yr old? 

(We are both consenting adults, and I do not feel pressured or taken advantage of if that changes your opinion)
