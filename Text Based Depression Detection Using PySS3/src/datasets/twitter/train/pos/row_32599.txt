In 8th grade everybody thought i was a school shooter, so i memorized the lyrics to pumped up kicks I havent look at the lyrics since 8th grade, but here's what i remember:


Roberts got a quick hand, 

he'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan,

He's got a rolled cigarette hanging out his mouth he's 

a cowboy kid, 



Yeah he found a six shooter gun,

 in his dads closet in a box of fun things,

 and i don't even know what,

 but hes coming for you, Yeah he's coming for you



All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet



Daddy works a long day, 

he's coming home late,

yeah he's coming home late, 

and he's bringing me a surprise, 

dinners in the kitchen and its packed in ice

I've waited for a long time,

And the slide of my hand is now a quick pull trigger,

I reason with my cigarette,

And say your hairs on fire must have lost your whits yeah




All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet


[Bridge]

run run run run, ruh ruh ruh run run run run, run run run run, ruh ruh ruh run, run run ruh run run

[Whistling the melody]

All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with their pumped up kick better run better run, out run my gun

All the other kids with their pumped up kicks, better run better run, faster than my bullet
