The Battle Is Over As the clock rolls over from 11:59 to 12:00, November is now over. All of you brave souls may now be put to rest, the fight is over. We have survived No Nut November. To those of you who passed, lay down your burdens and enjoy the fruits of your labor. And to those of you who failed, stay strong and try again next year. Now is a time to celebrate and rejoice, for the worst is behind us. Now go, leave this place and enjoy yourselves, you've earned it. I wish all of you joy for December.
