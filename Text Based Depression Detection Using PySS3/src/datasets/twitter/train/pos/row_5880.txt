Does anyone laugh at a joke like a minute after seeing it. Sometimes Iâ€™ll see a joke or a meme or something and Iâ€™ll fully understand it and I wonâ€™t laugh but then after like 20 seconds Iâ€™ll crack up. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t understand the joke I just didnâ€™t think it was funny at first but then suddenly Iâ€™ll think its hilarious.
