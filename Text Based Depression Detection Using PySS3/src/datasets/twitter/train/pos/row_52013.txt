A Poem I wrote abt writing a poem when I was writing a poem  

Three desperate guys try to write a poem.

It is for their english project.  
They squeeze, twist, and flipped thoughts in their heads,  
But no ideas can be mustered out of their minds  
How? They ask, how do we do this?  
This is as hard, as finishing this sentence.

Jokes were made, snacks were eaten.  
Tears were shed, ideas were beaten.  
Yet the screen remained white, white as fresh snow,  
Not one pixel of black yet lain upon it.

At long last, a spark of creativity  
Bitch slapped one of them in the face.  
But at that instant,   
 A squirrel came a tumbling   
down a sun-bleached oak   
It was the fattest squirrel he had ever seen .

Oh the pain! The regret! The disappointment!  
Oh, the shame, the sadness, the hatred  
Two hundred and seventy three thousand words   
within the English language,  
Yet one could never string together enough  
To show the sadness in his heart.

And so, from dusk till dawn,  
The trio slaved away.   
Finally it seemed, the poem was finished.  
As they dragged their silhouettes,  
Burdened with fatigue,   
Up the rails of the stained wooden stairs,  
And to the safe haven, that is their rooms,  
One remembered, and grew filled with despair

oh dear!  
They have done the wrong thing,  
All along!  


Fuck
