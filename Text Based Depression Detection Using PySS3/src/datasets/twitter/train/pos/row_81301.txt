Making blacks people pre pay on deliveries and restaurants isnâ€™t racist 

I worked at a pizza place and we didnâ€™t have a lot of dine and dashers types but when we did; itâ€™s always blacks. 90% of dine and dashers were African Americans, and we lived in a 90% white neighborhood. When I was out delivering pizzas, blacks never tip and thereâ€™s always a chance of them not even paying the full bill. I work on commissions so each delivery I made around $3.50. when blacks shorted me out by giving me a dollar or two less, I had to pay that out of pocket because going back and dealing with them would cost me even more money on lost deliveries. When businesses make black people pre pay, itâ€™s not racist, itâ€™s fucking years of experience. I wasnâ€™t prejudice against African Americans when I first started, experience made me more cautious.
