HONEST Advice I wish I knew as a 13 year old: Part 2 Last one got some attention but people seemed to miss the point that it was HONEST advice and not just advice.

This subreddit is absolutely awful at giving advice so I thought I would clear up some things.

This is advice I wish I knew when I was 13. Yes, I'm 14 but I'm still not 13 so who cares

It is NOT your responsibility to be your partner/friend's therapist. And quite honestly it's an absolutely terrible idea. If your friend is suicidal or self harming you do NOT have to help them, nor should you. Of course you should be there for them when they ask for help from you, but they need PROFESSIONAL HELP. As a teenager you do NOT know how to be a therapist. You will mess up, say something wrong, and leave the person even more depressed

Mental health is NOT something that should be taken lightly. Teenagers are stupid, and I'm sure we can all agree. We all make stupid decisions and regret them a year later.

No matter how much you think you can help, please DO NOT. Not only can you fuck up the advice but you can also very very likely ruin your relationship. They might not trust you or want to be around you because they remind you of that one time you were thinking of suicide and how you were the only one that helped.

Thank you for reading. The point of this series is to clear up some of the absolutely horrible advice that is given on this subreddit. This goes against the hivemind so I expect to be flamed forever.
