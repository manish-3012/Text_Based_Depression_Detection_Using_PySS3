I'm weak So a while ago I met this girl and we hit it off immediately we talked for a few weeks and she was interested in the same things as me which was amazing but she started doing those generic girl things like purposely making me think she is mad but when I ask she says everything is OK so after a few days I got pissed off and just deleted all of the chats and unfollowed her, 2 months later I get a text from her that says hi and I immediately forget everything
