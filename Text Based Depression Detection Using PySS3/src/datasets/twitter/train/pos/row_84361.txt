Fun fact about me #8 I think desserts with real fruits are the best type of desserts 

Cake? Whipped cream + fruits. 

Pies? Always something with fruits.

Icecream? With fruits. In particular berries 

Jello? ^(highly unpopular) with fruits.



Itâ€™s also weird, because I donâ€™t care for fruits much when itâ€™s plain. Itâ€™s ok, but itâ€™s not great
