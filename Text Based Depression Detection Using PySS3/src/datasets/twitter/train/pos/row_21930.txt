Iâ€™m a lazy piece of shit and I donâ€™t like it Iâ€™m sure many of you guys feel the same, no offense. I have such high expectations for myself and want myself to do more but normally I end up playing on my damn phone. Why did they have to be invented?! I want to workout and work on making money and finish all my school work. I do these things. But not as much as Iâ€™d like. I tell myself Iâ€™m gonna change but that never happens. Idek if Iâ€™m getting better at all or getting worse. If anyone has any tips on how to actually change, that would be greatly appreciated. Iâ€™m gong to sleep, hopefully Iâ€™ll wake up a new man.
