I need to know if anyone else has this issue Ok so like um idk if this is a puberty things or just me but recently I noticed that I have been getting... excited when someone is being a good person. Whenever someone is just being a nice friend or cares about me and gives me complimets I am starting to get excited. Does anyone else have this issue?
