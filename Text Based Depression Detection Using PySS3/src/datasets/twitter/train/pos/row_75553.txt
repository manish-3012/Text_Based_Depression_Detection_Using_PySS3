boomers, and our decline its frustrating when people from older generations cannot understand technology, like bruh. My dad literally just stares at tech when it doesn't work and says "Hey whats the matter?!" "Its not working" well duh. Then he cant even explain it to the tech peeps. I just sit there and watch as he fumbles around and yells at the IT guy. I felt like my brain cells were being ground down by sandpaper. Kinda sucks tho cause some people just don't understand and they really struggle in the modern world sometimes. Like Facebook. The sight is a cesspool for toxicity, but the boomers don't get that. So overtime they become more radicalized. I mean shit, at this point aren't we all just slowly being radicalized by the vices that grip us? Its human nature to act unlike they normally would when there is basically no consequences for how vile that person can be. It's unrealistic to expect decency we could be happy go lucky and kind on the internet. However, isn't going to be our generation that pays the mental consequences of this down the line? We're just sheep to a slaughter, and we weren't even given the resources to not be. Maybe I'm just being fearful, but I feel that the world, more over America will face social and economic collapse in the very near future. If I'm right, I wish you the best of luck. If I'm wrong, I wish the highest success and good fortune for you.
