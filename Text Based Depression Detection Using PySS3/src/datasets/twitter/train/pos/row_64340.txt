I literally got the worst classes classmates wise Like all my classes are majority female and they only hang out with each other girls and don't hang out with any boys like me. There's usually like only 3 boys (including me) at most and the 12 rest are girls. It's like this in a lot of classes but not all of them.
 
These girls the 'i don't know you don't talk to me' sassy girls.

And one time I went to sharpen my pencil one girl was like 

G: "I've never heard you talk"

M: "oh well i-"

G: "what's your name" (I've been in class with her for like a month and a half and she doesn't know my name

M: "oh my name is x"

G: "do you even talk"

Her friend: "yeah he does, don't you know he's in science class with us as well?"

G: "wait what, I didn't even know he was."

I went back to seat after that and my self esteem went down.

Also just to clarify, i actually talk a lot and I enjoy talking but since none of my friends were in that class, I had no one to talk to.
