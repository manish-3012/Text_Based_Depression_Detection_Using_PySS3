Imma be honest... I kinda wanna kill myself no cap. I was doing real good with those kinds of thoughts for a minute but they're back. I was talking to some of my friends and my whole mood just flipped to that and now I can't stop. I hate myself more than anything so yea, I'm great. Anyway thanks for listening to my vent. How is you guys doin?
