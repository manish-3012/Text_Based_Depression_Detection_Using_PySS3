Why does my dad try to get me to socialise just because itâ€™s my family My anxiety doesnâ€™t just disappear when you say itâ€™s my family. Why do I need to do things I donâ€™t want to do just because itâ€™s with my family? Whatâ€™s the difference between family and strangers. Sure we have the same blood but that doesnâ€™t effect anything. Why does family justify everything? I donâ€™t like socialising end off. I stay in my room for a reason and when you invite almost all of the family over I am not leaving my bedroom. I do not like socialising holy fuck why is that so hard to understand
