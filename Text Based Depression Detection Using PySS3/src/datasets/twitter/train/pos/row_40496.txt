Middle Finger to my teacher So it was the night before my bday and I was really tired and slept my family woke me up at night they had cake and all so it was cool but then while cutting the cake I was so sleepy I put my finger in the candles fire and burnt my finger and then boom next day a giant swelling on my middle finger which fucking hurt.

So I used the opportunity to show everyone I hate my middle finger right up thier face and had lots of fun doing it and didn't offend someone cause I just casually told them look I got hurt it preety bad and no one fights with a guy who's hurt 

Then during the chemistry lecture which all my classmates hate no one had done the homework and the teacher shouted a lot and told do the homework now so I stood up and said I can't I'm hurt and pointed up my middle finger I didn't get any shouting but rather speacial treatment 

So overall burn your middle finger and show it to people
