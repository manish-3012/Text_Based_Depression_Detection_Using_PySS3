honestly just a teeny bit confused people do understand that pride is not bragging that weâ€™re gay? pride is celebrating the fact that in the US being LGBTQ+ is not a flat out crime anymore. 

ik the vast majority of people understand this but then again iâ€™ve seen a lot of â€œat least straight people donâ€™t shove it in our faceâ€ on this sub lately

also im sure you would have much more fun hyping us up from inside the parade!
