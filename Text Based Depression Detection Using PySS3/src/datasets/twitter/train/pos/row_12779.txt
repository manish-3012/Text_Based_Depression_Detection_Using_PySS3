I had the greatest idea for a Netflix original. A CIA Agent recruits a Femboy Hooters employee named Chad to go undercover into an intensely regressive theocracy to smuggle out information. To achieve this goal, Chad ends up seducing the entire Government body, creating the world's most political love-triangle.

Think of the comedic potential.

If Netflix doesn't hire me in the next 20 minutes, we have to make this a thing ourselves.

Would you pay good money to watch this?

**EDIT:** Think of the potential in a scene like this: A CIA agent is trying to recruit Chad, but Chad doesn't know the agent isn't flirting with him.
