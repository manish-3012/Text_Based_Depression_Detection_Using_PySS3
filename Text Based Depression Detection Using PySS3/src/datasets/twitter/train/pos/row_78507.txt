What am I supposed to do with my life? I realise that the time passes quick and I do nothing useful. I have a lot of dreams but I am afraid that none of them are going to become profitable at one point so that I will have some money off them. I got no skills or a talent that might be useful. Hate myself for being so ugly and weak. I always tend to give up too quickly and it results in just more hate.

Recently I found myself not having any enjoyment from video games either. Just want someone to tell me what I need to do in life.
