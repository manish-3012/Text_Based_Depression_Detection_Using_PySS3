Croatian here. I canâ€™t explain how much it embarrasses me and hurts me to have to explain to privileged Americans why capitalism is bad.  I was born in Croatia and was there since then.  I have good memories there, but those about living there are awful. Family was poor, government is corrupt, constant unemployment, cultural decay (americanisation).  If that doesnâ€™t say anything to you about capitalism, idk what does. Please drop the capitalist ideology.
