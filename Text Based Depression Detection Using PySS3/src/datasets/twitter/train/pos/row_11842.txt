Do you know your identity or are you still trying to find it? Or did you naturally accept the one that's given to you? Or had to learn to accept it? I feel my whole identity is a fraud :-) I want to change my name, my face, my history (sadly not possible here), location, personality, voice, everything tbh. Idk this body and this place I'm in just doesn't feel right ðŸ¤•
