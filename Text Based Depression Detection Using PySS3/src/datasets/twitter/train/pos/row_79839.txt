Beginner pc build So Iâ€™ve been wanting a pc for a while now and I should get enough money for Christmas to get one, however I canâ€™t find one for 300$ or less. Thatâ€™s the highest i can go now I donâ€™t need it to be able to play stuff like call of duty or doom on max graphics, I just wanna be able to play Minecraft with a couple mods and stuff like that. Can anyone help me out with some parts or a prebuilt pc?

TLDR: gimme decent PCs for 300$ or less pls
