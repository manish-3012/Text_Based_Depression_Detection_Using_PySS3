Learning Today, Something New (150) The best we can do is that in itself. Everything takes time but once we understand and release the rush of "getting there", thats when we can begin to enjoy the process of **being.** 

Life has been a rollercoaster. A rollercoaster of high highs and a rollercoaster of low lows, **gratitude for them all.** We have to remember that without the highs, we wouldn't know what a low is, without the lows, we wouldn't know what a high is. **We push on.**

Everyday we wake up, everyday we are given a new chance to try something new, it should be mixed with **gratitude. We take waking up for granted which should be the first sign of being grateful when we wake up.** We can then move forward our day with a little more ease that "success", **whatever that looks like to you,** already lies **inside of us all.** We connect to "success" as something materialistic which is rather **affirmation of the process.**

**Enjoy the process, enjoy the journey and know that everything you're seeking is already seeking you, so just be.**

**I love you.**
