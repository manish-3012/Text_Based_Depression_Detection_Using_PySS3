My mom doesnâ€™t like my friends Iâ€™ve been hanging out with a new group of friends lately and theyâ€™re really fun but my mom started to not like them. Everytime I ask her if I can hang out with them itâ€™s super stressful and she started saying that I wonâ€™t be allowed to anymore. It really sucks because theyâ€™re always hanging out with eachother and itâ€™s not their fault but I feel like Iâ€™m just tagging along at this point and I donâ€™t know what to do
