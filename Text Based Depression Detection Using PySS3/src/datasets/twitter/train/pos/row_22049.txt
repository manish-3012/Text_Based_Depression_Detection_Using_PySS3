I was minding my own business in the shower Then I go to grab my shampoo bottle and there is a FREAKING SPIDER ON THE BOTTLE. AND THEN IT STARTED WALKING SO I NOPED MY WAY OUT IF THE SHOWER. Then after I got dressed, I was going to get the spider. But I look and THE SPIDER IS GONE! WHERE DID IT GO? Iâ€™m living in fear guys. It was nice knowing you all. 

In conclusion: I didnâ€™t wash my hair today.
