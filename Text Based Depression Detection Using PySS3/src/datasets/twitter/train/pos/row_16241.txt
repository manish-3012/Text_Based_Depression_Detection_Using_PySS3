The date was a success. And you know how? Because it ended with kisses. So first I had to pick her up and meet her parents, I made sure to say I'm going into the military. Then we went to the mall, went window shopping, and got bubba tea, m&amp;ms, and Doritos. After that we picked up spray paint and went to a bridge she goes to all the time(we held hands in the car). I already came up with my own signature and we made sure to write "Fuck Trump". After that I took her to my place. We finished off the fireball I his in my room and then watched some of The Boys since I love the show. My friends came over and we went with them to one of their houses in the neighborhood, here comes my favorite part. So we sat together on a chair, she was like halfway on my lap and snuggling me. I then got the courage to ask to kiss her by just saying "kiss?" And she said yes. And my god she's the best kisser ever. The only make out session I've had involved the girl chewing on my face. But this girl used her teeth in such a gentle and hot way. And her lips were so soft! I just kept asking to kiss her lol. But yeah, I'm really happy tonight, but I have to get thrown right back into the real world tomorrow
