Hereâ€™s why super straight isnâ€™t necessary Liking genitals is about preference; not about being transphobic so I understand why someone would not date a trans person sexually speaking. No one is forcing you to date trans people so I donâ€™t understand why people who use the term super straight is even needed. If your straight just say that your straight and move on. ALL TRANS GIRLS ARE GIRLS AND ALL TRANS BOYS ARE BOYS. No need to single out trans people just because they make you uncomfortable. Again, NO ONE IS MAKING YOU DATE OR HAVE SEX  WITH TRANS PEOPLE.
