We must mourn the loss of u/SaveThisVideo Today is a very sad day, ladies and gents. 

Weâ€™ve lost a true gentleman.

We have tragically lost u/SaveThisVideo. He was deleted earlier today under mysterious circumstances (likely by Reddit admins in an effort to keep users on Reddit).

He was not the only victim. We have similarly lost u/vredditdownloader.

(memes aside this is actually really bad news)
