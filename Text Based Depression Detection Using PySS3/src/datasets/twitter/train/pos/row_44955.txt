Need help dealing with jealousy I like doing art, i appreciate people who do art, i look at and watch a lot of art and even though im pretty bad at it, i dont really care.

However when i see other people my own age have art that looks amazing, I cant help but die a little inside because of how talented they are at something i love so much and for the past few hours ive been trying to ignore if but its 12am and when im trying to sleep is when im at my worst so if anyone knows something, even a small little thing, i thank you a lot.
