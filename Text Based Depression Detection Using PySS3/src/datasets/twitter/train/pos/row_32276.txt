Just listed please Just hear me out . There is a difference between being respectful to women/girls and being a simp . labeling someone as being a simp for help a girl no one befits because then he will try to avoid helping others girls which means less people who need help will not get it because someone else is afraid of being shamed for helping people then we grow  further apart and don't know how to communicate property which then leaves room for sexism and false accusations about how someone will act because of their genders .
