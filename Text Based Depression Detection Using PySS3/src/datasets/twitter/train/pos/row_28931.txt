i dont think i can keep holding on until they find a vaccine for this (and im not ACTUALLY going to hurt myself or do anything, dont worry, i never do) 

&amp;#x200B;

i just dont know what the point of living is if i spend every day in one room all by myself i dont find any joy in anything anymore and im alone 

what is the point of doing this when everything in my life has been taken away from me and nothing is left, and nothing will be any better until years in the future

what is the point of this when i feel like this every single day of my life 

two more years they say but i dont have two more years to waste my youth and lie in bed and wait for the ground to swallow me up 

im empty now and i dont have two more years left in me, or one.

im waiting to wake up from the nightmare or fast forward in time but thats not going to happen. 

i just want the pain to stop. i want to finally be happy, i dont want to be alone, i dont want to be in pain anymore.
