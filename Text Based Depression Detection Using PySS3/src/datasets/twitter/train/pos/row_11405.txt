I think my girlfriend is avoiding me on purpose. We set up sometime to speak to each other and whatnot and do whatever, but she never turns up for it. Last time I spoke to her irl was a few weeks ago which is why I'm thinking she is. In the part of town we're in, covid really isn't an issue as there are low numbers of cases. I never really get to see her and rarely in the hallways in school. I've just been thinking about it because when she says she'll come, she never does. I just want some advice and what to do because I genuinely think it's on purpose. Thanks
