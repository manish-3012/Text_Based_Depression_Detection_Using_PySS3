I'm alone, and fine with it, but lately.. I don't want an s/o, at least not until college. I don't have any friends and I'm okay with being alone. Past relationships have not worked out, and I find they're not worth the effort. I broke up with my second ex 7 months ago. I'm fine, obviously I was really sad for a few weeks but I did get over him. 

Lately though, I've been getting dreams about being loved again. Just two, but dang... They really did have my heart aching. It's hard to explain being with an s/o if you haven't been yet, but it can be amazing. Sadly, all good things must end and so I don't want a relationship. Those dreams though.. They're amazing and also they suck
