Do I have to be a skater or surfer or just athletic to wear something like Santa Cruz Iâ€™m shopping right now online for some shirts but all the stuff I like I feel I shouldnâ€™t buy because of what they represent like skating or the outdoors. I some BMX stuff but thatâ€™s it. What do u guys think, should I buy some Santa Cruz shirts or Hoonigan shirts because I do kinda like them.
