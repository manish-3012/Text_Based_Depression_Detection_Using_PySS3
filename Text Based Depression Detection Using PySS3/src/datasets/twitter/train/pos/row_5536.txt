Stay safe out there everyone. I have heard on multiple discord servers that there could be a *MASSIVE* cyber attack on big social media platforms. They will attempt to send very disturbing content and they will try to dox you and leak any personal info. Just a heads up. This might be false, but don't risk it everyone, stay safe out there.
