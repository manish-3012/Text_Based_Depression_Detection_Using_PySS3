I Dont Want To Be Alone Anymore I've lived my whole highschool life distancing myself from others, I want to be in a relationship and make real friends. I need advice on how to be more courageous and make new friends, I only want to do this because I feel like I'm going to live an unhappy life and regret my actions.
