Right so what do I do Ages ago I wrote poem for my crush telling her how I feel and I've just remembered it and I'm sure that I'm in love with her and I don't want her to think I'm an anime loving creep like she probably does  I  want her to think of me as someone who would be there for bar if she needed it what do I do?
