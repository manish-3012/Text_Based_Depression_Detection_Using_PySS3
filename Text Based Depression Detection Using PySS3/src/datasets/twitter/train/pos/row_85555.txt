I'm sick of this stubborn ass boi (online friend) I've been there to listen to him for a year now on how his life sucks since he graduated. I listen and I suggested why doesn't he get a job or go to uni, and this boi is just like "nah"


Like dude, you are 20 and still taking your parents money and living with them rent free, at least get a job.


Like what the hell, I know depression is hard but at the Same time you are just wallowing in your own sadness and refuse to get any help so how do you expect me to try help you?
