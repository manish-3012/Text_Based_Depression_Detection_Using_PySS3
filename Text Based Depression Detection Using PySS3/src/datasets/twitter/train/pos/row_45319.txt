My friend has been talking sh*t about me. What should I do? A bit of backstory: We met in Yr 7 (Am Yr10) and a few friends of mine have told me that heâ€™s been talking about me behind my back. Should I confront him and risk getting into a fight or do I let him carry on to a point where he does it to my face and then confront him?
