I have no idea of how my father would react at me telling him Iâ€™m trans ( ftm ) I honestly donâ€™t know like he could literally beat the shit out of me or scream or give me a silent treat or tell me Iâ€™m wrong or call me an attention seeker or hug me and help me go on t or be happy and tell me heâ€™s proud or do a joke and tell me he loves me or call me his beautiful son and give me a kiss in the forehead .... so in conclusion... * confused trans noises *
