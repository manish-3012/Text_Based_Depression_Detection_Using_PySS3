i didnâ€™t realize how isolated iâ€™ve felt until i just facetimed with someone for a bit and kept tearing up the past week or so iâ€™ve pretty much had zero contact with anyone other than my family and it was gradually decreasing to that point before then. even though itâ€™s been nice to relax and spend some time with family for the holidays, i also miss my friends, and i didnâ€™t realize how isolated iâ€™d been until i was on facetime with someone and i was on the verge of crying basically the entire time just to be talking to a human being outside of my family
