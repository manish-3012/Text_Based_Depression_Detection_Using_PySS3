My dog is getting put down tomorrow Basically what the title says. My dog's name is Libby. She's a beautiful black Labrador and I've she's been with me for as long as I can remember. Today her back legs collapsed underneath her and she couldn't get back up no matter how hard my parents tried to help her. That's when they decided that it had to be done. She's 14, the same age as me and she's been with us the whole time. Dad still remembers when she fit in his palm. I remember her three litters of puppies she had years ago. Today was the first day I had seen dad cry. I'm crying writing this but I'm sure it'll really hit me tomorrow. Dad is digging her grave tomorrow. She'll be buried in the back yard. I'm also scared for my other dog, Richo, a gorgeous, blond Lab. He's younger than Libby and has never been alone before. I'm sacred that he'll die soon, too.

I'm sorry I just had to vent.
