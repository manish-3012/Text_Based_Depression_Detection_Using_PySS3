I told my crush I like sher and this is what happened So not over two weeks ago, I decided to gather up my courage and tell my crush I liked her, and i, since we are good friends, called her. She answered and we chatted for a while, I awaited the perfect moment and told her, turns out she had feelings for me too, and over the next two weeks we chat a lot, flirt, etc. But then, two days ago I am packing since I am going to the sea the next day, and I tell her that we can't talk tomorrow cause I will be in the car all day, and I get carsick if I look at my phone in the car. She seemed to be OK with it. Next day I drive to the sea and we can't talk, then in the evening I text thta I arrived, she doesn't answer, I don't think much of it and go to bed, next morning I check my phone, she ahs read but has not answered, I then at the beach send soem photos, write some messages, she reads immediately but doesn't answer, I decide to ignore it, next day the same happens, so in teh evening after the beach I call her to ask if there is a problem, she immediately turns off the call, I then tetx her and ask if there is something wrong, and she tells me that nothing is wrong, it's OK, I proceed to ask if she is sure, she can confide in me, and she tells me to f*ck off angrily. And since then she ignores me totally. Yesterday I asked if she could tell her brother to check his phone caud ehe often turns it off and doesn't see messages (me and her brother are best friends). She ignores it and doesn't tell her brother anything. And that si the situation currently. But I need to include the whole story, because a year ago we actually dated, but it didn't last long, because 20+ people including people I trust with my life, told me she had cheated on me, when asked upon this she ignored me and I broke up with her. Late ri found out it wasn't actually true. If anyone can help me please do, because i am worried and dotn want it to go south again.
