Aye I need some help yall This is probably the worst place to ask for advice but fuck it. To keep it short and simple, I fucked up major and racked up too many unexcused absences due to not joining video calls. It's a fuck up on my part due to me either oversleeping, or suffering internet problems and not saying anything to my teachers. My grades are great, I just racked up to many. My state takes this shit seriously and can withhold my credit and graduation for this. And if my mom finds out she's probably gonna kill me. I planned on emailing the school myself from her account and simply coming up with some random reasons to get these excused, is this a good idea or should I just take the L and tell her and let her handle it? I'm honestly keen on Doing this myself though. 


This online school stuff is trashðŸ˜”
