How do I email a teacher who entered a 0 as a grade for an assignment for no reason? Alright fellow redditors, I got a little situation. I have an English assignment that we did last week, I completed the components with no issue, then got everything posted onto a discussion board for the class. I go to check my grade in my county's program, and my teacher gave me a 0 on the assignment. I went back and checked, and I missed one component (we had to respond to 5 other paragraphs, I think I only responded to 2-3). How can I email my teacher about this? I don't know of any time a missing component to an assignment has resulted in an automatic 0, nor was I informed of any such penalty. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
