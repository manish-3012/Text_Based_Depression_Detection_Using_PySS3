I'm just so angry (no hate to anyone mentioned) Why do I have to live in the deep south. Everyone just has such bigoted beliefs and are so christian. I'm literally the only atheist in my entire family's bloodline. Even the school I go to have homophobes. The history teacher literally called bisexual people "perverts" and I tried to call him out on it, and he told me I was wrong and then people in the class started telling me i was gonna go to hell. So, My parents are pretty christian, they make me go to church every sunday. Like my mom literally sat me down and talked to me once telling me that I need to know that being gay is wrong and a sin. I just kept nodding. Because I know if I disagreed with literally anything in the bible, I'd be disowned and our relationship strained. My parents aren't bad people or anything, though. They aren't racist. they love me, feed me, buy me shit, and take care of me just like any great parent would. But I'm just so tired of having to keep my beliefs in and not call people out for being bigots. I'm just so tired of christianity as a whole. I hate it. I just happen to live in a state where its extremely widespread. I happened to be born to the only 40% of parents in america that don't support LGBTQ. But I know that I should just keep quiet, and that's the best I can do. Because I know if I spoke out, my relationships would be severely altered and almost ruined. But I wanted to get my frustrations out on this subreddit, because I know that there aren't any hardly any (I've seen literally maybe 5) bigots on here, and an extremely large portion support lgbtq and don't care about christianity. To anyone who has a similar situation. I love my parents, they're great people really, but the christian religion has just ruined the south and it needs to change. I'm sorry.

EDIT: I'm not gay or bi, I just was venting frustrations over people thinking that it's wrong to be that way.
