To all my anime watcher: I just watched redo of healer.... I just watched all 3 episodes of Redo of Healer uncen and man... not my proudest fap.

That second episode has got to be one of the most brutal things I've watched in a while. I mean I understand why he did what he did tho, but obv it's immoral. I heard about the scene that happens in ep2 from people on this sub but I just brushed it off and thought it'd be one of those things anime girls do where they kinda want it like it's some guilty pleasure but act like they don't. BUT NOPE. I WAS VERY WRONG. idek whether to consider it hentai or normal anime anymore. 

Overall, quite surprising to say the least. Whoever wrote the manga must've been wildin lol. I fully understand why the show got canceled (or so I heard) after just 2 episodes.

can't believe I beat it to that scene in ep2 tho.. somethings wrong with me
