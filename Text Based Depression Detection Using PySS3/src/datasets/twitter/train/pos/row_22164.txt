I'm so terrified of leaving my room that I've eaten three meals in five days. My dad hurt me a couple nights ago. It wasn't the first time, and I doubt it'll be the last. He knows that I'm scared of him, and that's the way he likes things.

I'm tired of it and I don't wanna be around him. But I'm hungry, I'm dehydrated, and I'm cramped because this room is fucking tiny.   
What can I do? I'm thinking about waiting till he leaves and then stashing some food up in my room
