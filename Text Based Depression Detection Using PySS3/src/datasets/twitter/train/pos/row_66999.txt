Lonely plz help Iâ€™m really akward around others and struggle with social interactions. Iâ€™m usually just the friend who is there but doesnâ€™t so much. I never get invited to do anything and I donâ€™t know how to get more popular/ more social. Any tips on how to think/ what to do to get out my lonely bubble?
