Bruh Iâ€™m so fucking sick of how much I think/worry about the smallest shit I just wanna stop itâ€™s so annoying I canâ€™t even utter a single sentence without panicking internally. I need to know what people are thinking about me at all times and if not it feels like this person hates me. Sometimes someone I know will say something nice to me and it feels like itâ€™s a matter of time until this person hates me. I try to make the most of the amount of time they like me bc everything gets fucked up eventually once they know more about me
