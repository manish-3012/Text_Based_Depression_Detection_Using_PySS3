How old were you when you got a crush on s/b for the first time? I don't think I ever felt anything like that. I am pretty young, but many people my age seem to have people they really like, but I can't tell if it's a majority or a loud minority.

It's late night (almost early morning), I am suddenly very worried about that.

Upd: Thanks to everyone who answered, I am starting to feel like I may be the problem.
