Am I being cruel? A girl confessed their love to me but I rejected her because of distance (Shes american and im irish.) I still talk to her everyday and shes always saying she loves me and showers me in compliments. (Ive never been confessed to before or had a gf before btw) we are super close but idk is giving her hope cruel
