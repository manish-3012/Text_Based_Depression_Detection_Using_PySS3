What the fuck is with this youtube ad? I got an ad during a video on youtube called desire. It was over a half an hour long, and explained over and over that there was some magic trick to seduce women. I listened for a while (Not to find out what it was), and eventually I gave up listening to his linky rant and It led to a site to put in credit card info and stuff

Please tell me someone else saw this bullshit, and if they did, why is youtube allowing this crap?
