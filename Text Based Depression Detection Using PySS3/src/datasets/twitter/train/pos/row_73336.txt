My parents wonâ€™t let me spend my own money I almost never spend money, I canâ€™t remember the last time I made a purchase over $10. I have saved up quite a lot over the years and the first time I ask to buy something worth $80 my parents wonâ€™t let me. 

They say I have to earn it and when I ask them how they wonâ€™t give me answers and say â€œfigure it outâ€. I get good grades and donâ€™t get in trouble so they donâ€™t have much reason to not let me. Itâ€™s really frustrating and I donâ€™t know what to do.
