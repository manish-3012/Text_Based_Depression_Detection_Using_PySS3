Does anyone else feel like this or is this just some weird head canon only I have. Am I the only one that feels as if 14 isnâ€™t a teen?

Like yeah duh it technically IS but it doesnâ€™t have the **vibe**

And no I donâ€™t mean that 14 is extremely young or are babies but I just feel so... out of place in this sub. Yeah I relate to everything, I just feel like a whole ass fetus around these 17 year olds.

I feel like when you turn 15 is like when youâ€™re an **official** teen. 

I hope most people get what Iâ€™m trying to say and donâ€™t think Iâ€™m crazy ðŸ˜”
