I think I might be dealing with BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder) but I don't know what to do about it My appearance is constantly on my mind. I don't know how I look and I don't trust the mirror, others, myself, pictures. I check the mirror probably 20+ times a day. It's distracting my studies and everyday life. And I'm letting it hold me back from new opportunities such as introducing myself to people. I didn't realize just how much of a problem I had until just recently 

I don't know whether I look absolutely terrible, average, attractive. And my perception of how I look changes throughout the day. I feel like my height is the only thing keeping me from being completely ugly.

The problem is that I feel like if I tell my parents they'll either drastically overreact and which will make me feel even worse, or they'll downplay it
