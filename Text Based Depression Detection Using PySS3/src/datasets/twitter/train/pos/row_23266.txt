I have severe anxiety &amp; my gf of almost 2 years has depression Everytime we argue over text i feel so completely helpless because i am always super worried sheâ€™s going to hurt herself , especially when we argue at night and she tells me to leave her alone. i feel like i have to stay up all night long in case she texts me with a change of heart and wants to apologize, but iâ€™ll be sleeping so iâ€™ll miss the text and something terrible will happen. sheâ€™s gotten 100x better since dating me and she hasnâ€™t hurt herself in a long time but itâ€™s always in the back of my head that something will go wrong and i wonâ€™t be able to help
