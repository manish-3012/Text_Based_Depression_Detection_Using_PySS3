Sleep paralysis Please help, this is the second one Ive had this same night   

I went to bed at 11:30 like usual but I didnt get more than 3 hours of sleep  

The first one was a regular dream, I was watching on my phone when it suddenly turned black and there was a dark person in it, I couldnt see past 2 feet, then I was pinned to my bed, there was a big arm I didnt recognize pinning me, I saw someone's legs who thought was my brother but wasnt, and I tried to scream for help but nothing happened so I tried to move as hard as I can nothing happend until I managed to drop my hand to hit the legs so I could get help, then I woke up, I think I was groaning a few seconds waking up at 3:08 am  

I was scared shitless so I stayed up until was no longer 3am, and I closed my eyes at 4:30am  

The second one happened right after another dream, I recognized my room, but this time was different, there was a white human shaped thing with no features, no face or anything, maybe about 8 feet tall, I tried getting up, but everytime i did anything it just went back instantly, everytime I open my eyes it closes instantly, every leg motion I did went straight back to where it began, and I couldnt move again, then I realized my hands were tied and I started getting pulled back on my bed, but it kept pulling for really far really fast when my bed is just a little bit longer than me, then it stopped, and I tried to get up with screaming out my lungs, my throat was about to burst   

Then I woke up at 5:30am  

And that leaves me here writing this reddit post with less than 4 hours of sleep and 5 years worth of fear, anxiety, fear, and pant-shitting  

I think sleep paralysis might be hereditary because jesus christ did my older brother get them a lot, almost every night I hear him struggling and groaning in sleep, I dont think this is a good sign for me
