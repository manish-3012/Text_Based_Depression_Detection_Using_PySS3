I fucked up... Ok so i wanted to sign up for the nextdoor app and I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY WANTED TO SEND MAIL TO MY HOUSE! Dude I am so dead. I'm contemplating jumping out the fucking window. To contact them i need the piece of mail so i guess i screwed. I guess the best way to get out of it is to play dumb and say it was scammers. Please if someone knows how to cancel it, i'd really appreciate it. Also my life is on the line.
