Random History Facts because Iâ€™m bored:Day 2 During WWII, an American bomber had just finished a bombing run on the Germans. The plane was almost destroyed and barely flying. They didnâ€™t expect to make it through another field of AA and cross the English Channel. Then, a German pilot, one kill short of becoming an Ace, arrived right next to the bomber. The German pilot remember something his commander said. â€œIf I hear of you shooting a man in a parachute, Iâ€™ll shoot you myself.â€ Those words echoed in the pilots mind. To him, this half destroyed bomber and itâ€™s crew were in a parachute. The pilot guided the    bomber across the AA guns and saluted when it made it to the English Channel. The two pilots met each other many years after the war, and were good friends until they both passed away in 2008. In this instance of mercy, No Bullets Fly.
