If you're having trouble taking a shit, use this simple lifehack If you feel like there is some poop stuck up there and it just won't come out try this method.

First assume a squatting position on the toilet, as this in itself can help make it easier.
After that, take a sheet of toilet paper into your hand (so that it won't be covered in shit) and press on [this spot](https://imgur.com/a/fEawZgl).

This should help lure out that piece of poop. It usually helps me at least. Might work on females, haven't tested it.

This may look like a troll post, but i genuinely just want to help.
