I like a girl, we havenâ€™t talked in a long time and I donâ€™t know how to go about it... So we havenâ€™t talked in like 2 yrs, since the end of high school basically. I didnâ€™t go to prom because I was a dumbass so I didnâ€™t get to see her again. 

Last week I looked for her in my Facebook friends (yes I still kinda use Facebook) and noticed that she had removed me from her friends (Iâ€™m not actually sure if she did or if I did) so I added her back and she accepted my friend request. 

Yesterday, I started talking with her and we caught up on some things (where weâ€™re at in life) but thatâ€™s where I donâ€™t know what to do. Back in high school we were friends but not that close, basically just school friends so I donâ€™t really see myself randomly asking her to hang out sometime since we never really did it before. But she did tell me that she just bought GTA so I guess I could start there and take it slow, I just hope she also has a PS4 because I ainâ€™t buying another console just for that.

So yeah I just needed to get my thoughts out of my head so if you read the whole thing thank you and Iâ€™m willing to listen to some advice that you dudes and dudettes may have.

TL;DR: Read the title.
