Why is everyone posting about them being bisexual and transgender? Like I get it I've read it a million times and just honestly don't give a fuck.
I'm problably going to get dovnvoted, but that's how it is when you share your opinion.


Please remember I'm not against trans or bi I just don't care about the millions of post about coming out to your family and how you family doesn't accept you.

Yeah it sucks
