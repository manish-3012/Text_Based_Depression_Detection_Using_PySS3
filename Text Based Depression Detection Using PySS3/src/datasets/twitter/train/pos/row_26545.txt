Rant about school So schools will be opening in 20 days so here's a rant.
My school is basically an  appartment block. It's old, the classrooms are small and the stairs are so cramped that it takes soooo much time just to move around when there is a break. The "playground" is really crowded because it's pretty small so it's loud everywhere.
The principal is an old cringy bitch that gives unfair punishments for the smallest shit imaginable.
Some of the teachers are really fucking old (like how-the-fuck-havent-they-retired-yet old) and make lessons soooo boring and uninteresting. It feels like time is passing much more slowly during class.
Most of the people in my school are fine, but there are some I just can't fucking stand. I'm talking about the "popular" kids who are just straight up annoying and cringe. There are also the people who try to act "cool" all the time and like to make fun of other people just to appear superior.
I don't really have close friends at school, I spend a lot of my time alone like an awkward fuck and it's 100% my fault. Most of the close friends I had on middle school went to other high schools and because I'm socially awkward I failed to make new friends and now it feels like eveyone has a friend group, except me.
In addition, I only do enough work to pass my classes with relatively good grades, but in reality, I don't feel I really learn much. I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing since I am not interested and find a lot of subjects entirely pointless and a waste of time, (looking at you, mandatory ancient Greek class) but it's probably bad since i lose a lot of valuable information I might find useful in life.

There are a lot more things I hate about school, but this post is already pretty big so I'll stop here. I really don't want to go back to school, but since I have to, I'll just try to make the best of it this time around.
