A bit to know about Iranâ€™s â€œConquerâ€ exam, which is practically mandatory for all High School students Hi, Iâ€™m a 16yo Iranian boy here to talk about a nightmare every Iranian child has to go through

So Iran is as you probably know a somewhat IntEresTing country. Itâ€™s way better than what the western media makes it seem like, but it does come with its own challenges; one of which is the so-called â€œconquerâ€ exam

In Iran, there is a law that mandates all studying should be free of charge until the Diploma state, and even after your Diploma, you have the option to go to governmental universities which are free for up to a PhD degree even. 

Now this sounds awesome at first, but the problem is that governmental universities use an exam called the â€œKonkoor Examâ€ (A name derived from the word Conquer) to accept students. The exam is taken nationwide every year and millions of students participate in it. 

This exam is incredibly difficult, and includes basically all lessons included in the High School stage (10th, 11th and 12th Grade). Due to the extreme competition, we Iranian students have to study the whole 3 years of high school to become ready for the exam, as well as take classes in order to help us learn â€œTest-Taking Shortcutsâ€. 

Three years of nonstop studying has an immeasurable toll on the studentsâ€™ mental and physical health. Gaming? Donâ€™t even think of it. Hanging out with friends? Maybe once every couple of months at best. A relationship? That one is beyond impossible. 

Many people suffer from Depression and Anxiety in this period. In fact, my mother being a Psychiatrist, she says she has seen countless teens commit suicide during this period just because the studying pressure was too high. 

Many students (especially ones studying to become a Medical Student) have to take the exam multiple years to get accepted in their desired University and Field of Study, wasting a major part of their lives. Also many have to migrate across the country so they can simply study in the field they love.

Students who do succeed will be exhausted and usually canâ€™t function well for a couple of months and even worse, what they studied for 3 years will mostly have gone to waste as a lot of the â€œTest-Taking Shortcutsâ€ they take are completely useless in university. Many donâ€™t understand the lessons at all and simply mark questions based on â€œparrot-like-memorizingâ€ as we call it (which means they just learn to repeat the answer to tests from memory and donâ€™t actually get the reasoning behind what theyâ€™re studying). 

Now youâ€™re wondering, what about paid universities. Those do also exist, but theyâ€™re really shitty. They have the worst teachers, worst equipment and people who go there learn absolutely nothing. 

What about just not going to university at all? In that case, youâ€™re literally not gonna have a single percent of chance to get a job and if you ever hope of migrating to another country, having at least a Bachelors is a must unless your parents are uber uber rich and you can afford Migration by Investment.
