Im happy today Proud to say that Today has been a good day.

I was able to eat properly and didn't have any problems, i was able to watch anime with my brothers during the whole afternoon... And finally earlier which was 8pm in my timezone (It is currently 10pm) I was able to play "Among us" with my friends and my little brother. 

Im mostly close with guys and one was my best friend for 3 years now and the other was someone i consider as a little brother. We were had a group call and we had fun playing... I really miss them.  

It may not be much for u guys but im proud to say that I had fun and I am happy. I hope I'll have more days like this again. 

Im Really Happy Today :)
