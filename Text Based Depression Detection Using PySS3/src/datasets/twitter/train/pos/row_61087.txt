Why the fuck do people want communism Like it's a shitty concept, and has never worked out. Plus it only works on paper, but could never work in reality. They say that the ussr wasn't communism but it was, it was a lesson in what happens when you try communism. Why do people who have never experienced it or heard what actually happenes want it so fucking badly?
