I'm genuinely ditching my old life, and I got the perfect plan First of all, I'm Danish, so school works a bit differently. So this is my last year in school, next year I'm going to gymnasium (the next step in education)
So here's the plan: first of all, ditch the old style, new school, new me. Fuck the establishment I'm going full punk on this shit. I want to be unrecognisable. Second of all: now that I'm on meds and can actually receive dopamine so I need new friends. The plan? Get all the fucking nostalgia shit, I'm breaking out my old bakugan, beyblades, silly bandz, skylanders all of it, fucking *all of it*. It's a test, those who make fun of me for bringing it aren't worthy, those who get excited over it however, they get to be my friend.
Which I guess is a wretched fate but I will share all of my special interests and hyper fixations with you, and I'll throw in goodnight kisses as a bonus.
Feel free to tweak or add to the plan if you got any good ideas
*muah* have a nice day
