My sister's boyfriend died My weekend has started out weird and ended out depressing. Harris was my sister's boyfriend. He was the sweetest soul ever, such a nice, smiley guy. 3 years older than me, he's in college with her and he just went on a walk. And then he got hit by a motorcycle. It was an instant death, the person riding it said. He was hit so hard he just died before touching the ground. it hurts, but at least he didn't go in pain. At least he didn't have bad last memories.

We just sat there and cried when we got the news. My sister was out with a friend. As soon as she got back everyone burst into fresh tears. I'm numb now, I can't cry anymore, but it felt like I lost a brother. He was so good to me. 

Fly high, Harris.
