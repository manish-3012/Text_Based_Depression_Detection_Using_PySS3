Dad calls me tarty for wearing mascara I swear to god. Why cant i just wear makeup because i like how it looks on me? It makes me feel good? Its not about attracting male attention and its so frustrating??? Like seriously?? WHO AM I TRYING TO ATTRACT IN MY OWN DAMN HOUSE?? Besides I have a boyfriend anyway to obviously Im not trying to attract anyone.. it makes me feel more confident and happy. Why cant he just be happy for me??

My dad just saw me wearing a TINY amount of mascara in my OWN HOME when I have absolutely no intent of going out anywhere or anything. And he just decides to spew crap like "you look 18 when you wear that" "if you go out to bars men will hit on you" "you look tarty" (which i didnt even know the meaning of but he decided to tell my mom and have a laugh about it). Then he goes on to say women wear makeup for other people, women use makeup to attract the opposite sex, then goes on to say that its biology. Oh im sorry that biology is apparently saying that your FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is "dressed sexually provocatively" for wearing mascara that I bought at walmart two days ago. Thanks a lot dad for basically calling me a wh*re for wearing mascara. Ffs I hate men like this.
Anyway thanks for reading my rant im just really frustrated :).

I think ima go put on some more.
