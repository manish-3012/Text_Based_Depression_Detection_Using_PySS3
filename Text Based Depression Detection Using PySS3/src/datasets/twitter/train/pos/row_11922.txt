Can we talk about old tech? Was somewhere where you say you name where you are from and a made up use for an item you pick up, I grabbed a floppy disk not knowing the activity. When I got called I said my name, where I am from, and for my made up use I said "it's the save icon!" Jokingly. I heard someone say "he's probably never used one of those" of course I've never used one I don't like in the 80s, my phone has more RAM than this thing has storage. I understand that it was revolutionary, but don't rag on kids for shit they have never used, or needed to use. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
