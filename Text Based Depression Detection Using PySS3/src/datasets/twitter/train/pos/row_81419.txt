Flashback to the time I got a bee stuck in my mohawk in 3rd grade. Everyone was looking at me horrified and I didn't understand why until someone pointed it out. everyone went inside and the teacher brushed it out of my hair with a clipboard or binder or some shit then we fucking booked it inside too.
