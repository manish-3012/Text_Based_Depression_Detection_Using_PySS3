Are guys more visual-based when it comes to attraction than girls? My dad says so, but I am not a guy so I cannot confirm.  Appearance does very little for me, personally.  If you pass the threshold of healthy enough to have energy and basic hygiene, we're good.  

If you had to rate how you're attracted to people percentage based, what percentage would the appearance be?

DW about sounding superficial or whatever, you can't help liking what you like.
