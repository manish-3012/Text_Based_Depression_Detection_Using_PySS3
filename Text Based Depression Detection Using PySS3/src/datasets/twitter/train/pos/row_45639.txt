I just overheard my mom talking on the phone with a store about my Christmas present, and I'm getting a gaming computer! I'm really excited guys. My computer was a really good computer for its time. It is a Windows 8 Alienware. It is very slow and can't even run Minecraft and Discord at the same time.
