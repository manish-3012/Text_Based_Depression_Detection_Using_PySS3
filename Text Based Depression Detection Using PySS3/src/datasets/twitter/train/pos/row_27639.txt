Help me please i need someone whos good at giving advice So i like this girl and me and her are really good friends we talk all the time at school and it sometimes feels like she likes me too but we dated last year and she broke up 2 months into quarintine and well we didnt really like each other over quarantine but now were back at school and i like her but i dont know if she likes me. Shes nice to me and we joke together but when we go hang out with others shes not really the nicest and i want to ask her but for one i feel like its wrong because we already dated and two i dont have the balls. Sorry if this is hard to read im really nervous and i cant really think
