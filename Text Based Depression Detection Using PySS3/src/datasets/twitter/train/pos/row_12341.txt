Haha mood swings go brrr Bruh some days Iâ€™d be very reserved and quiet and thatâ€™s how I like it tbh, but I have never been like that and so some days Iâ€™m hyper and over talkative and shit just goes back and forth like that lmao. Itâ€™s annoying because I like being quiet and reserved, thatâ€™s who I really am, and I also tend to see through peopleâ€™s bullshit on those days. But when Iâ€™m comfortable, Iâ€™m so hyper and talkative to the point that I annoy my friends. Shits mad annoying lmao. Very weird rant sorry for wasting your time hahaha
