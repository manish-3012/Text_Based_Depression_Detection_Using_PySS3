Song writing ideas? Music has always been an escape for me.

I play guitar, and put a little beat behind my lyrics, slow-ish strumming, but I've been really stuck on what to write. 

No-one has heard my music, apart from my dog...and any hidden cameras my Mum might have put in the house... Crap, that'd be weird... Geesus, I'd hate that... 



Any lyric advice? Poems? Rhymes? Guitar, even? 
Anything. 
I write about sad-ish stuff. How I'm feeling, alot of the time. But I've noticed I keep using the same lines and lyrics, so I'm just writing the same stuff, over and over. I need something new.
Even something to write song lyrics about? A place? 
Anything. 

I don't know why I'm turning to a bunch of teens for this- but why not?
