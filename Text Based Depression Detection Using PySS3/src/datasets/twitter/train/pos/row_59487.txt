Any ideas for long-distance friendships? Uh, context, I'm not even atypical nerd, just exist as a person who is not going to be classified by any stereotype (cuz at this point stress has killed my entire personality). 

Anyways, I've been trying to get myself a few friends now that I quit my old high school and am in a new one (and know absolutely nobody here). And I did manage to find a few people to talk to, which just goes down in a few days or after 1 convo. Any idea to build a sustained social contact/friendship/relationship over a long distance (also the TZ's are about 9 hours apart usually)
