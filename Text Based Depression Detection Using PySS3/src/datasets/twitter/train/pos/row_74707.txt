How much money do you make from your first paycheck When I turn 16 I wanna get a job and start making money asap. For a first job I want to work at best buy cus I've been a huge computer/electronic geek since I was 11 and it's a basic retail store job so it's a good first job I think. I wanna blow my first paycheck(s) on a fully decked out high quality gaming setup. Anyone who has already worked a job, how much can I expect for my first paycheck?
