Anyone else like trying to have arguments on Russian and Ukrainian music video comments? Like I was just listening to Ukrainian and Russian music and a music video came on that just sounded terrible, so I say "I don't even remotely speak Russian, but this shit sucks" and these two guys come on, and one says "Fake yu" and the other goes "Let" and that stuff is just too funny to not share.
