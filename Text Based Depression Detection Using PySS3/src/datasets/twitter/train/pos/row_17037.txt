Donâ€™t grow up too fast. You guys have it ROUGH. 

I am a woman (born in 1990)  and because the technology simply wasnâ€™t available yet, this meant I didnâ€™t get a cell phone until I was 16..I remember being PUMPED when I was 17 and could afford to buy myself the razr cell phone and it was no where close to being a smart phone. 
Computers were still mostly a luxury when I was 15, only rich kids has one. I had to learn how to read a map to drive and if it was far Id print pages of written directions.
I didnâ€™t know how to properly apply makeup until I was like 18 years old - and back then, only grandmothers wore false eyelashes. I donâ€™t know how yâ€™all survive with all the social media.

Seems like all of you are forced to grow up so fast just to keep up with the technology, and I have no idea how you do it. 
Being a teenager is hard enough, nevermind having to face the fucking entire internet on the regular. I just donâ€™t know how you guys keep it together...I especially sympathize with the ladies, how you manage to overcome insecurities when Instagram exists is beyond me; Mad respect.

I guess I just wanted to remind this sub to enjoy being a kid while it lasts. When I was one of you I couldnâ€™t wait to be a grown up but I really wish I wouldâ€™ve taken more time to enjoy my teenage years, &amp; Iâ€™m pretty sure most adults feel the same.
Freedom and control is cool, but itâ€™s also HARD AF most of the time.

I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is have fun and learn now to love yourselves and take this time to discover who you are and what you want out of life... and for godsâ€™ sake donâ€™t let society influence you too much, because none of it is real anyway. 

Also - save your money now. If you feel like you need to spend money to look cool, the. Those people arenâ€™t really your friends anyway! 

Thanks for listening to grandma. Take care. &lt;3
