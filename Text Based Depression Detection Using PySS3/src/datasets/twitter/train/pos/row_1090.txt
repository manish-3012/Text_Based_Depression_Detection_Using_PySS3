My mom broke isolation and now I canâ€™t sleep Our family is at small risk of having corona so weâ€™re in isolation and arenâ€™t allowed to walk outside or interact with anybody.

Yesterday I wasnâ€™t allowed to walk down and buy a single item for dinner to make it taste well, which really ruined dinner for me, it was really important that I didnâ€™t go outside for 3 minutes and break isolation, even though it was evening and the only person Iâ€™d likely interact with was the person behind the counter.

I didnâ€™t sleep well today and canâ€™t concentrate on reading my book without falling asleep so I decided to take a nap in her bedroom (there are 2 beds, and also I couldnâ€™t sleep in my own room  due to adjacent noise). Just as Iâ€™m about to fall asleep for the 7th time, the front door opens up and weâ€™ve got a guest! My mom and the guest starts â€œspeakingâ€ (shouting) to each other in Brazilian.
Who cares about corona or my sleep anyways.
Iâ€™m so mad.
