Red Roses - Call Me Karizma https://youtu.be/ve8kyELOKRA

No surprise
Hate in your eyes
Full of rage but empty inside
Let's decide
It's you or I
Who leaves here alive tonight
Teeth are grindin' I don't mind it
Love the violence
Lost my mind and I can't find it
Sit in silence
Fuck that scream it like I mean it
Hear the voices
I can beat 'em
Embrace the pain and fight the demons
I'm in pieces
All I see is
A little bit of red
Little bit of red roses
Drippin' from my hands
Cutting both of them open
Way too many lies
Way too many bonds broken
Way too many bonds broken
No surprise
Hate in your eyes
Full of rage but empty inside
Let's decide
It's you or I
Who leaves here alive tonight
Who leaves here alive tonight
Who leaves here alive tonight
Bones are breakin'
Ground is shakin'
Heart is racin'
Much temptation
Burn the nation
God can't save us
Fuck that
Scream it like I need it
Let these voices off their leashes
Embrace the pain and fight the demons
Can't find peace when all I see is
A little bit of red
Little bit of red roses
Drippin' from my hands
Cutting both of them open
Way too many lies
Way too many bonds broken
Way too many bonds broken
No surprise
Hate in your eyes
Full of rage but empty inside
Let's decide
It's you or I
Who leaves here alive tonight
Who leaves here alive tonight
Who leaves here alive tonight
Who leaves here alive tonight
A little bit of red
Little bit of red roses
Drippin' from my hands
Cutting both of them open
Way too many lies
Way too many bonds broken
Way too many bonds broken
