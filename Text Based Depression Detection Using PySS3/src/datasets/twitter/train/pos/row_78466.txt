I don't know what to do and its making my cry I want to use my alt to send this because I don't want my friends to see this but I dont have enough karma so I'll have to hope they don't see it.
So recently my friend told me that he's severely depressed and his thinking about killing himself and asking me how I'm coping well in lockdown. He told me that he's been staying inside all the time and hasn't been outside in months so I said that could be something to do with it but he said he can't do that because he's built up so much anxiety that he's scared to go outside.
I want to help but I dont know how, I'm not a therapist but he keeps asking me what to do like I know everything but I dont.
Even though he thinks I'm doing well in lockdown, I'm actually not I've got loads of stress and stuff. And I just feel like I have to act normal and like nothings wrong for me to help my friends get through this time but if I'm being that source to lean on for them, who can I reach out to.
Right now I'm feeling super stressed out because I'm having to hand in my final pieces of gcse coursework and on top of that I'm beginning to think that I have adhd. Also I've got the feelings that I don't know if I'm straight like I've always thought and I'm feeling like I might be bisexual and I've got all the worries of what my parents might think. Aswell as that my friends are slightly homophobic, they don't mean to be but I'm worried about how they would react.

To summarise: my friend is having suicidal thoughts and turning to me for help, I don't have anyone to turn to about my problems like potentially having adhd and questioning my sexuality.
