Finally 16 and gonna start driving soon ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ Most people say 2020 is the worst year, but because of all this terrible stuff thatâ€™s happened it makes the good unforgettable. Iâ€™ve gotten my ways around high school, Iâ€™ve met so many new friends online. And one of those is now my special someone. I love her like no one could ever. This year started with a crash but Iâ€™m gonna have it end with a bang.
