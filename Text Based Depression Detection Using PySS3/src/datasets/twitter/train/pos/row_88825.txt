Feeling sad today I thought I made some new friends in this new college today. I decided to follow them on Instagram, and they don't follow me back, so i start overthinking like damn i've always been a random and annoying people to them. My social skill seems to disappear as i grow up.

(ps: please dont blame me for using instagram, it's the most popular app in my country)
