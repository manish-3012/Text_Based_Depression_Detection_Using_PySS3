Am I preventing my happiness? I made a post before talking about how I simply don't get attached anymore. Specifically talking about friends and relationships. The two main reasons I provided were this

1. It's tiring. I find friends fun to hang out with but even the friends I don't need to wear a personality mask for just tire me out way too much. And relationships might be even worse because of the fact that you have to manage your own life and there's too.

2. I'm in high school. Eventually one way or another we will never see each other. This mindset has kept me calm against bullies because I know I'll never have to see their face again but it makes me wonder if I'm doing my life good by preventing the pain of being separated from a close friend or preventing my genuine happiness.

Does anyone else feel this way?

Advice welcome
