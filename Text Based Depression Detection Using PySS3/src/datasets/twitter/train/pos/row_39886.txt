I now have two years on Reddit! Came here when I got absolutely tired of 9gag, now I have discovered many amazing communities and this is my favorite. 

Also in that two year period I managed to get a gf so thatâ€™s cool too. 

Thank you, kind people of the internet, I promise I wonâ€™t post a selfie on here.
