Iâ€™m small and my family makes fun of me a lot 
This is another account because some of my family follows my main one  Iâ€™m in the tweens area and Iâ€™m very short Iâ€™ve took vitamins done stretches and to no avail my friends make fun of me for it but Iâ€™m kinda fine because theyâ€™re friends itâ€™s kinda what they do but even my family makes fun of me Iâ€™ve made it clear so many times that I donâ€™t like my height and hate to be made fun of it even my favourite cousin that I see once a year and is the best Iâ€™ve seen recently and I donâ€™t know he just came back kind of a dick I even told him to his face that that I donâ€™t like it when he makes fun of my height he kinda just brushed it off and made fun of me like two minutes afterward I mean heâ€™s great in other ways not all bad but Iâ€™ve made it clear countless times and nothing is there any advice you guys can give me on confronting my family or to get taller but mostly the family stuff
