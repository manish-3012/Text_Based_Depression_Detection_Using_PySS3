To all those who feel lonely and want affection in a relationship but have never had feelings for someone, please prepare yourself for the worst Not sure how many people are gonna see this but who cares.
If you feel alone now and really want a relationship with someone but have never met the right person or someone who you never had feelings for or felt connected to, mentally prepare yourself for the worst possible outcome for when you do meet that person.

As an 18 year old guy who never had feelings for someone before, finally meeting this girl I like and getting rejected, that feeling of loneliness, gets way worse afterwards even 2 months after. Don't get hung up over it either, you'll find the right person eventually. So my advice to all of you great people out there is to first, don't let your feelings build up and find out if this person likes you not and that way you'll save yourself from a lot of pain. Don't read into things too much, what might look like signals that person likes you might not be. So basically don't emotionally invest in someone until you know they like you back.

And worst case scenario, you made all of these mistakes already the same way I did, just remember that you will get past it and find someone better.

I'm also just typing this out as a reminder for myself to not make these mistakes again
