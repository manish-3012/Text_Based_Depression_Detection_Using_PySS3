my grandmother probably will pass in a year Guys, don't know where to start. Just a couple of minutes ago I overheard a conversation, my mother, with my brother.

Really don't know where to start, it is my favorite grandmother, and she has cancer for a year. Last year she had and surgery and chemotherapy and everything were fine until now. She was yesterday at the hospital and had some sort of observations or Idk how to call it. Nothing wrong for her, but my mother works at that hospital and knows much more

So, I am not completely sure if it is true what the title says, but anyway, the cancer is progressing, and the point is why I am posting it to this subreddit, is that I am a teen, and maybe had the same situation and can give me some advice? 

P.s I am going also post it later on r/advice and maybe Christians, cuz idk really what to do ;(
