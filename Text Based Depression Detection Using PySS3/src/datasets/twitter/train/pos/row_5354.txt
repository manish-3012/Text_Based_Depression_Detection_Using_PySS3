r/Minecraft is confusing.... I spend 20 hours making a functioning computer in Minecraft and it gets about 20 upwards arrows. Some guy takes a bloody screenshot of INTENDED BEHAVIOUR (bundle holding only one mushroom stew) and gets 11.5K upwards arrows. In fact generalise this to Reddit, it's all luck anyway.

Sorry for weird wording, the bot thinks I'm begging for orange upwards things. I'm not I'm just annoyed.
