How the fuck do I get over arachnophobia!! I cant stand this fear of spiders! There is a spider somewhere in my bathroom but I dont knkw where and even if I did know where there is no way I could kill it because I'm to scared to go near it! There us no reason to be scared if spiders most even the poisonous ones cant kill you if your a healthy adult and basically every spider is scared of humans and runs away from them. They are helpful and kill many bugs that are bad. So why am I scared of them?
