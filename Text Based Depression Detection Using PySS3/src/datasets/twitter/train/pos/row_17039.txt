Anyone have ideas on how to take hand pics lol Iâ€™m trying to make a youtube channel to put videos of me playing rhythm games on my phone and I want my profile picture to be a picture of my hands but I donâ€™t want it to look like, creepy(?) I guess you could say. So does anyone have any advice on what I should do  for the picture
