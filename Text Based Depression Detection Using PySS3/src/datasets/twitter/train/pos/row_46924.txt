Itâ€™s my 17th birthday! Good riddance to one of the sometimes best, sometimes worst, most interesting, other times most boring year of my life. I grew a lot as a person and found a couple new interests. I had multiple first experiences and maybe more are to be had next year. Looking ahead to a year of more uncertainty, more good times, bad times, and if Iâ€™m lucky, more great times and fun
