I have a genuine question I'm a teenager but I'm a social outcast so I don't have any sort of perspective on what we're like, so, um, could a fellow teenager (that is not a social outcast) tell me what we're like and what's popular with us? I'm looking for detailed answers because I want to educate myself, thanks!
