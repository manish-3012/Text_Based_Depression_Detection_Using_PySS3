My neighbor wants to kill my cats Ok let me get this straight, i Have two cats Andromeda, and Chantilly (I will post pic of them soon), here im Brazil its quite rare to have home cats so they just roam around, and there where the "problem" begins, one of my neighbors is a sweet old lady, but on the other side is a dickhead. He came in quite angry about my family cats, saying that the cats have gave in 500 BRL (Almost 100 dollars) in loss in his car by scratching, but here where i don't think it's my cats, bc they sleep a lot on top of the cars here im my house and won't you know THERE IS NO SCRATCHES, and to top all of he treated us by saying he is gonna bringing some dogs to kill the cats. Yeah and I am kinda worried about my cats, bc there is another neighbor that kill cats for no reason, buut i think he stopped, thank god.
