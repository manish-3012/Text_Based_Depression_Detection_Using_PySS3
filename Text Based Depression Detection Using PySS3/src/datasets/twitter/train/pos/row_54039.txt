Hiiiiiii 18mmm Hiii. After the transition into my first year of college, I feel like I've lost a lot of friends which affects me now and has me feeling more desolate than ever. I'm a huge star wars fan and also love music as well. I can keep a convo going and im very empathetic in case you ever need to vent or anything of the sort. So yea, if you're okay with all that then feel free to text me :)
