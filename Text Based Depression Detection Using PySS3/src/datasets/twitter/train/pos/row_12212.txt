My friend committed suicide Before I continue, let me just say that I'm not trying to be a karma whore or anything. I just need to talk about this to people. 

I left for college a few weeks ago and subsequently fell out of touch with people I wasn't as close with. That's fine, it happens, but then I got news that one of those people killed herself a couple of days ago. She was the kindest and most selfless person I knew. I don't know anyone with a single bad thing to say about her. But sometimes that doesn't matter. Depression doesn't care about how people really feel about you. 

Please take this as a reminder to reach out to people and ask how they're doing. Some people, like my friend, never show any signs of being depressed or suicidal until it's too late. I can't help but think what would have been different if I and others stayed in touch with her. Now I'm 8 hours from home with no way to attend the funeral. Please, don't take the people in your life for granted. And if anyone needs to talk, my messages are always open.
