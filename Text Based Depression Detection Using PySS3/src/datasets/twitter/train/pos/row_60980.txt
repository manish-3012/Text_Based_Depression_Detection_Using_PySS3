I just made a discovery. I found out i'm the kid in the Pepsi throne meme [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BRCF8GOHTbX1j2qgbb2OptN8BcOg6Ip8?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BRCF8GOHTbX1j2qgbb2OptN8BcOg6Ip8?usp=sharing) heres some evidence, well uh i don't know how people got a hold of the pic  but that was me in 4th grade. what happened was i was in a after school program and the school got a shipment of Pepsi (and yes they sold Pepsi the elementary and primary school students.) and they were stacked up so i thought it would be funny to make a throne and sit on it. when i did that the caretaker said to hold still and she took a picture and posted it on Facebook and i didn't know this existed till now.
