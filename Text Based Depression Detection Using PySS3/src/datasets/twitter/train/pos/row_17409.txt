Reasons why you *NEED* to play Wandersong HOOOOOLY SHIT I adore this game  
I recently finished it 2 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.  
It's a short-ish game, but packed to the brim with all around charm. Now I already know people are going to have no idea what I'm talking about, so here's a short summary ripped from steam.

*"A musical platforming adventure with an emotional story. Play as a silly bard and use music to interact with everything on a journey around the world. Along the way you'll explore, solve puzzles, and meet a huge cast of characters!"*

This is gonna turn into a huge mess if I don't split everything into bits, so...  


* **The story**

WOWIE I rarely get so emotional over video games but this one really got to me. Despite the looks of the game it's extremely deep and story driven. It teaches many important lessons about self reflection and how one views themselves, which is something I think a lot of you guys might need to read. Miriam is a very relatable character, and seeing her identify and overcome the same kind of problems I was (am) facing was really... nice. Every character has some sort of arch, even side NPCs. If I had to say it reminded me of something in particular, I guess I'd say Majora's Mask. Asserting and overcoming powerlessness is not something that I thought I'd be seeing in this game but it was very very welcome. Also there are actual unexpected twists! Maybe I'm just too baby brained to see them but it's hard to pull those off very often.  


* **Unique game play**  


I've never played a game like this before, really. Everything is super fresh and new, and it just feels like taking a big breath of fresh air. Despite the odd controls, it's very easy to get a hang of and get the ball rolling. If you weren't aware already, Wandersong is VERY very musical focused. You control most things in game with your voice. Despite this, the game doesn't punish you for bad rhythm, so if you aren't used to rhythm games you won't have to worry about not being able to finish. In fact, it's mostly puzzles, with each kind of puzzle being nice and refreshing imo.  


* **Everything else lol**  


OH MY GOD every character is so charming I fell in love with everyone. Every character is very well written, so much so that it can be hard to pick favorites. As much as I love the main characters, I can name just as many side npcs that I love too! No one really feels all that bland, just like the music of the game! Its no surprise that the music in a game about a bard is good, but... MAN, it's good. It's weird how it can get you humming short 3 note jingles and you don't even get annoyed. And don't get me STARTED on the art style of the game. It's so colorful and fun, and does a great job at storytelling too! Even just a change in background color can go a long way, and this game knows that. It's style is stupid simple and extremely cute. I am heavily inspired by it myself, it just feels so magical  


This turned more into a rant than anything but god I love this game so much, and theres so much I haven't even mentioned yet. If you even THINK you'd enjoy this game, please try it out. It is definitely worth your time.
