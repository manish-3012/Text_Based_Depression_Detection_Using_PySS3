Today is my birthday (help me celebrate a covid b-day) Alrighty guys today is my birthday I turned 19 and I just wanna say I joined this subreddit when I was 16 and man has it been a wild 3 years. Iâ€™m still in the teenagers subreddit because well it is nine*teen* after all. I appreciate this subreddit for its memes, itâ€™s social approachability and the people. Have a wonderful night everyone.
