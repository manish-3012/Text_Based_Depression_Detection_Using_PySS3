Wait guys , if the earth turns to be night and day , and the halo ring world has one side and it's facing the sun. How do people get night time unless they dont get it , also , the o in the halo logo looks a bit like the ring world and the sun which is a bit clever , I've never played halo before and I'm definitely gonna play it but do they even get night time?
