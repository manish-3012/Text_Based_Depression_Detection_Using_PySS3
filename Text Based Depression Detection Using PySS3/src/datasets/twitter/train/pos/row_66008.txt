Well. I did the most stupidest thing that anyone could've done while making a test that already counts for your final exam. I forgot the last page...... I fucked up big time. The test went so well and those last questions were so easy. I just wasn't thinking straight because this week was pretty heavy. My teacher already said that I can't do anything about it anymore. If it turns out the grade is really bad I can make the test again. But I wanted to use that for my first one because this subject was new this year. Fuck me. Always check if you have made every question.
