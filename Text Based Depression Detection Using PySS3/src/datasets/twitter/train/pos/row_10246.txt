Been a week since I ended a relationship with aa friend, any advice? Basically, I sent the "this isn't working out" text a week ago and they left me on read. I miss them, but I'm more hurt by the fact that they obviously didn't value our friendship as much as I did. How do I resist the urge to text them especially since they were all I had?
