I'm starting senior year without my closest friends. Should I find new best friends for my final year of high school? I'm going to start my senior year of high school next week without my trusty friend group. I got into a big argument with one of my closest friends in February and we haven't spoken since, except for one time via text when she saddled me with the blame for how things went down. Side note: Can I just say that I hate text-fighting? Anyways, they replaced me with another girl who honestly has more in common with them than I do, and I'm actually doing fine now. I was treated kind of poorly by them for quite some time, but wish them all the best and am ready to move on. I have other solid friends in different circles here and there, a few people I can talk to and laugh with in school, but no one I'm overly close with. Should I try to find another group of close friends for the school year or just talk to different people and stick it out until college? I'm socially introverted and need to make the conscious decision to put myself out there or I just won't connect with anyone on a meaningful level. I really don't care if I skip out on partying or whatever this year, but would I really be missing out on that much by keeping to myself most of the time (especially outside of school)?
