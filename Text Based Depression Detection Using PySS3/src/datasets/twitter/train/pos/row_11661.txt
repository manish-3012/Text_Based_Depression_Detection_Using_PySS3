Why I hate children so much. They think they are so clever, see them study watch thrm learn, how I HATE those goody goodies, how they make my stomach turn, I've got a little secret, that'll really make them cry, it's a nasty kind of magic, from a special kind of guy.

This book is made to order, but it isn't to be read, when they open up this book they're sucked inside instead to the most unpleasant place they've ever seen, the magic labyrinth of I.M. Meen.

Very scary and confusing, destination of my choosing, magic labyrinth of I.M. Meen.
