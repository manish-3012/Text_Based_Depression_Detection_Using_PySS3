I got a girlfriend! I know it seems stupid to celebrate but I'm grey aromantic and there was a chance I would never have romantic attraction to another person besides my ex ever again. and on top of it, she genuinely likes me for me and is showing me actual affection. it feels amazing to have someone who supports me with my decisions and shows me affection unlike my ex who showed affection, but in a super fucking creepy way(if you want elaboration just lmk and I'll put a story in the comments). and she's actually in person too which makes it better (we're not seeing each other irl rn because of covid but she goes to my school and stuff). I'm just happy about it and celebrating to myself. kinda stupid ik but yeah, I'm stoked :)
