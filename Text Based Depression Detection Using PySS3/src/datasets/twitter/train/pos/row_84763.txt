Anyone who creates anything media well can relate. So I'd say I'm good at film, but I also do art, and program. Every time I'm looking for something to do with any of these skills, someone will always ask for something way too big.

I am looking for a job related to film, but I keep getting these local music artists that have a vision, but no equipment other than an IPhone. I sketch a character out of boredom and people will ask if I can draw their OC real quick or ask if I can teach them how to draw, neither will listen. I say that I'm working on a game, and they're either going to ask if I can make them a game, ask me if I can add all this stuff to my game or ask if they can be on my team as the ideas guy, all situations will result in ideas that suck or are way too big.
