Lol my friend unknowingly crushed my soul So I at school and for the most part, I was having a really horrible day. The pressure of mounting work and upcoming projects I need to do literally made me cry that morning. 

But in the lunch time, I was just hoping to take a breather and chill. So I was at a table with some of my classmates (Not really saying anything because I was feeling crummy.) and they were just shooting the shit. I decided to show them a song from one of my favourite bands, My Chemical Romance. The song was Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na):

Not even 2 seconds into the song, my friend's face scrunches up and says

 "Euagh. Yeah not my type of song." 

I then said "Wait it gets good."

He said "Dude, just put in your headphones..."

With that, I plugged in my headphones with a deafining click

"FINALLY. Thank you." he says.

I mean, he obviously had sarcasm in his voice and he meant no harm, but when he said that I felt so isolated and embarrased for my taste in music and even just in general. I just spent that lunch with my head down.  

Yeah. Sad times.
