Everybody forgot about me... So today is my birthday and all (literally all) of my friends forgot about it, it's 23:00 so there won't be a miracle, and I feel upset because I always try  to treat them well but never receive the same treatment, but I think it's time to turn away, start from zero and change my social circle, wish me luck!

-I'm not doing this only because they forgot about my birthday, this is the last of a list of reasons.
