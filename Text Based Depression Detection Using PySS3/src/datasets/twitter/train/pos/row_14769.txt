I think my mom cares more about her friend then her own family. My mom is always at her friends house and driving her friend places because her friend canâ€™t drive, and when she got home today she went straight to sleep, and like half an hour later when me and my brother have to start heating up leftovers she gets up and immediately leaves to drive her friend to the store, and whenever sheâ€™s home sheâ€™s either sleeping, to tired to spend time with her kids or working, and Iâ€™m tired of it.
