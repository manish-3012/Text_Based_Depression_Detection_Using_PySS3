Got a job but couple of questions So uh Iâ€™m 14, and somehow managed to get a part time job for half the year 
Many people have told me that this is useless and a waste of my time as I should be studying although this current year hasnâ€™t been that hard for me and to be honest our teachers barley assign homework and even if they do itâ€™s always dumb easy questions so I know getting this job will not be effecting my life in school 
(if I werenâ€™t doing this job I would just be playing video games)

Just wanted to know what you guys think of it as your probably near my age or something.

(If your gonna say â€œwhy do you need the money?â€ 2 answers 
1. I could use the money to help in the future 
2. I have a addiction to transformers)
