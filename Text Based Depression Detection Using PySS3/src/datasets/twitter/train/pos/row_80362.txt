Unpopular Opinion: Megamind is better than Despicable Me OKAY, HEAR ME OUT. Iâ€™m not here to say Despicable Me outright sucks. The movie is great, just a little confusing in some scenes.
But, Megamind on the other hand... the creators had a MEGAMIND making this movie. The movie has Great characters, great comedic action, and they always get me intrigued watching the movie.
The Movie had stellar voice acting, and overall a great story-arc. They flipped the â€œsuperhero tropeâ€ into something else. (Also, you know that MetroMan could have easily just killed or captured Megamind instantly with supersperd but he chooses not to because he enjoys having fun as a hero).

The problem I have with Despicable Me, is that they had very cheesy and unfunny jokes in the movie. For example: The â€œBoogie Robotsâ€ in Despicable Me is kinda stupid and random. The fart and butt jokes galore kinda piss me off, as if they want to cater to kids, and they think kids are stupid enough to find fart jokes funny. COME ON Hollywood! We love jokes, stop acting like we were stupid watching them. 

Anyway, Megamind needs a sequel and we need it now
