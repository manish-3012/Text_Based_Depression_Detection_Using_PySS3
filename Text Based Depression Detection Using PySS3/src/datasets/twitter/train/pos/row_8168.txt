Did you guys forget all things Algebra when going into Algebra 2? Idk if this applies this everyone but Iâ€™m sure everyone has algebra and algebra 2 at some point. Anyways, in our school district, the math curriculum goes: Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and then whatever. Algebra was pretty easy for me, but then Geometry was a nightmare. Since Geometry is so hard and Algebra 1 and 2 are 2 years apart, Iâ€™ve literally forgotten everything. On the first day they literally gave us a pre assessment and I barely knew shit. I knew like some factoring and substitution and elimination but the rest I was fucked. Itâ€™s not due until Tuesday and Iâ€™m getting help from friends but man this all sucks.
