Two of my dog's litter died on sunday :( So my dog had a litter of five puppies 8 weeks ago abd they were so healthy and happy but suddenly one if them got very ill

He threw up and had diorreah then just collapsed. He was just lying there on the floor for a few hours until he died :( 

During those hours, two others became ill and had the same symptoms although one didn't collapse and recovered (he is now doing fine)
The first puppy to get ill died three hours after getting ill and the other one who died lasted for about 7 hours.

It was just so sad and heartbreaking to see them struggling for life on the floor with unblinking, expressionless eyes.

We buried them and i made graves for them in my minecraft world
