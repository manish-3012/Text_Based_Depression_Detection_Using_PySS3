[TW!] - Is there any moroccan su-cide hotline number ? hHey hey, my name is rayna and I need your help please. I've been feeling pretty weak both mentally and physically for these past last months. Each time I would try to vent to my family, they would simply ignore me saying that "It's just a phase, you're growing up". They simply took away my phone thinking that not letting me talk to my friends and eventually try to vent to them. So here I am, writing this small message from my laptop. Su-cide, s-lf h-rm and mental illnesses are, sadly,  a really taboo thing in my country and are all concidered as "Haram" since Moroccan people are all "closed-minded". So I would only like to have the Moroccan su-cide hotline number (even tho I doubt that there's one). Thanks for taking time to read this :) I'm really sorry for the possible spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language, I'm still trying to improve.
