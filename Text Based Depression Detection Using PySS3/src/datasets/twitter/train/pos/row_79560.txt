I need your help...please My best friend had started dating this classmate of ours but she eventually broke up with him because he's a pinch abusive and now that they broke up, he states her down and tells her shut up at school. Now she wants to drop out just to get away from him and I just want her to stay and be strong against him. Am I in the wrong? What should I do? What should she do?
