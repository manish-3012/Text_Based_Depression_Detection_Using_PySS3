Dude. I'm so fucking sick of transphobes who think they're not transphobic and try to justify what they're saying. Like obviously no transphobe is good, but if you just straight up call me a tr*nny I have slightly more respect just because you aren't hurting my brain as bad as people who think they can say shit like "I don't agree with trans people, but I don't hate them" and still be on the good side with LGBT people like bruh what
