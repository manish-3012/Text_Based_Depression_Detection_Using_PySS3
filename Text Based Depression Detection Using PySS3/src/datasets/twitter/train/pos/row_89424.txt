I've been affected by many power outages during my online school year. Now I have too many missing assignments to catch up on before the quarter closes. I've been affected by many power outages since my online school year started. They have caused me to be absent and fall behind constantly. I now have way too many assignments to catch up on before they're locked on October 22nd (the quarter closing date). I've contacted staff and teachers, but they can't do anything about it. I'm usually a mostly A's and B's student, but this semester I'm failing two of my classes because of the outages.  I'm a senior and I'm supposed to graduate a semester early, but this situation has made it needlessly difficult to stay on track in school, and has been really demotivating. Any advice on what to do? I'm in California if that makes any difference.
