Well, we canâ€™t print anymore We canâ€™t use the middle school printer anymore. Why?

Somebody printed out an inappropriate picture and a fourth grader ended up finding it. Plus the person printed out five hundred pages. 

So thanks to that person, we canâ€™t print out assignments, and thatâ€™s gonna make school and life in general a lot harder for me.

So whoever printed that picture out: fuck you and I hope you are mauled by a leopard.
