Could I get some help? Hey everyone!

I have a friend who is really trying to get a youtube channel started. He has begun to become a little discouraged because he is not getting many views, which is where I think you can help. Would you check out his channel and open (You don't even have to watch) a video or two? It would mean a lot to him. Here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4tkqOHNqqVaLgqrf77VitQ/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4tkqOHNqqVaLgqrf77VitQ/videos)

Thanks, guys!
