I need advice Ok, so i was finally allowed to go out with the bois by myself,ik, my mums overprotective, anyway, she thinks im â€œgrowing up so fastâ€ or some crap because i bought a monster, then, when i told her there were also a couple girls she started thinking the the one ive known for ages is now my â€œgirlfriendâ€ and we â€œwent on a dateâ€ i mean, honestly, can i not be friends with a girl without being her girlfriend? I want her to stop but i dont know how, what should i do?

Thank you for listening to my ted talk
