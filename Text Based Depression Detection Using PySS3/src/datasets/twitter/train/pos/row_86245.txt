I need help guys, awkwardness levels are dangerously high right now. So this girl I really like came over and we had a lot of fun. Anyways she gotta go cause it's late and i bring her to the door where we chat a little more and finally say goodbye. She was with her friend. And as i start turning away she makes a step in my direction trying to hug me but me being an idiot doesn't realise it in the moment and she aborts the hug. Of course now i feel sad and don't know what to. f
