Does anyone have so hugs left? Stupid me Luxembourg city on my own because i wanted to see more of europe (im 15) and i made a school project out of it so i could go. I booked a hostel and hoped that i would meet people from my age and get new friends. But instead of having fun, im just sitting alone in my room feeling bad about everything. I could really use some hugs right now....
