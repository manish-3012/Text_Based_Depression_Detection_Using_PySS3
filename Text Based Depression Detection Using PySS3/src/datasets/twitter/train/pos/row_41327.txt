hello, it's my birthday! Background: M/19 now Toronto. Goes to uni in a creative field.

Man.. I don't like birthdays that much. People act like it's all about you and text you and wish you but it doesn't mean anything. The real ones are there for you everyday, no matter what. I feel sad on my birthday, I have wonderful parents but i feel sad because I can't provide for them yet. What an I doing with my life man, I'm 19 now for god's sake.

Please god, help me. Help me get a good job so I can afford my own birthday and take my best buddies and parents out to a boat party and rent lambos and celebrate for real. Idk man, maybe I'll still fucking immature.
