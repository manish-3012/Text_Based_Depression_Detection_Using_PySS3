Is this unhealthy? My regular routine is a little odd compared to that of others I know. 

I wake up in a day, and maybe I'll do some yoga, deep breathing and stretching. Love it. Helps clear my mind and make me feel more loose. Then I go to school and skip breakfast. I don't pack a lunch, but maybe I'll grab a Greek salad from the store. I dont do this often. Maybe once a month. I get home and I'll do ten minutes on the elliptical before my brother gets home and I have to take care of him. He's special needs. I also have homework to do. I'll eat whatever is for dinner, and then I'll do some more yoga/weight lifting before going to sleep. I do this through the week, and on the weekend, I'll snack through the day maybe, and I try to make it a healthy thing. 

This worked for a little while. I lost 20 lbs last year, but now it isnt doing anything. I'd tried other diets before, giving them a month or more to work, but nothing ever happened. Hard to get my mom to buy health foods too. I'm not obese. On the BMI scale, I'm on the edge of normal, but I want to lose weight. Why am I not losing weight? Why am I asking on this sub? I'm not sure. Rough day, so politely, don't question it.
