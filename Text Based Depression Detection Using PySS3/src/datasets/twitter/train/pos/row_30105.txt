If any of you guys need help with homework, I'd be okay with helping you out. As long as it isn't language or music theory, I might be able to help you.  I know that online classes suck and sometimes a teacher explains the material too quickly or too slowly, or maybe you weren't really paying attention, or maybe the teacher is just really bad at explaining material in an easy-to-understand way.  If I'm dong something wrong by posting this or if I mis-flaired this, then please let me know so that I can delete or edit this post.
