I have a predicament... (Im not sure if this will be allowed or not, but if it needs to be taken down, dont hesitate to, I understand)


So my sister went on a hiking trip with some friends, although, her phone was broken (iphone 6) and she had no way of communicating with us (my family) in case things went south. So I leant her my phone (Samsung Galaxy A20) and taught her how to use it.
Since I was now without a phone, my parents lent me my grandfather's old iphone 4, which previously had water damage and would have random shut downs if I tried to open the camera or stream video through Youtube.
Now here is the predicament I have found myself in...
The iphone 4 is out of date, lets face it. I tried to download an app so I wasnt completely unentertained, but was blocked due to not knowing my grandfather's Apple ID password and I couldnt watch video. So I thought, could I watch Pornhub on it? (I had also previosuly tried watching Pornhub on my DSi too)
So I booted it up, launched a secret mode tab and began dabbling. I found a video I wanted to watch and played it. It actually started playing and I was watching it until...
It shut down, which normally isnt a problem. So i tried to boot it up again, but it got stuck in recovery mode
Now I'm no genius, but from what I know, Recovery mode freezes the processes and stores them on the hard drive so you can restore the phone or take it to a genius bar to be repaired.
You might be asking, why not just restore it?
Well my mother wants contacts off it and she wont allow me to.

Sorry for the long read and probably waste of time for you all, but I just thought I'd share
