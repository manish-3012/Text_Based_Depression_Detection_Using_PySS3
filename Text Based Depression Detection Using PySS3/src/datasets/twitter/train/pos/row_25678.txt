Should I ask this girl out? You know, this Friday I got nothing to do and my parents will be with my sister doing something, so, instead of playing videogames I was thinking in asking a girl to have a â€œdateâ€ (friendly date, I dont need a girlfriend right now lol) 

But there are multiple things drawing me back: the fear I get accused of doing something bad, the fact that Iâ€™m 16 and dates arenâ€™t really that common between teenagers (at least in my country).  And least and most important, Iâ€™m afraid of what my parents will say. Theyâ€™re not conservative or that shit, but I fear they will ask me a lot of questions on why am I going out with just one girl and not with my bros.

I actually want to take the shot and see if the girl would like to go, but Iâ€™m still not sure.

What do you recommend me to do?
