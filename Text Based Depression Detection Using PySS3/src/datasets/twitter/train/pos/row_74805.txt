You know, for a few hours i felt like a normie It was nice being with a girl and gaming with her. Even though i had just met her, i felt like i knew her from before. It was a nice dellusion to believe that it was gonna last and turn into a relationship. She even paid for it lol. But yeah, good things come to an end. I just got to experience a 0,0000000000000000001% of normiehood.
