My teacher spent the whole online class letting us chat. It was great, he wanted us to start saying what we missed about normal life and was just to vent and it turned into a whole thing with music and what rap was good and bad and for some reason BTS was in there. It was a great day and i think more teacher should spend time doing this with there students, its a great way to act like a normal classroom.
