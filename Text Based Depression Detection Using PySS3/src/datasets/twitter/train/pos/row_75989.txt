Hi! I am an amateurish artist who wants to make a game! Any programmers here? Hey! Just saying hi, but also curious, if anyone is 15-17 ish and a programmer! I had a game idea. Itâ€™s pretty weird, bullet hell with multiplayer is the main concept tho :)

Iâ€™d love to work with you! Especially if youâ€™re the same time zone as me :333

Have a lovely day, bye!
