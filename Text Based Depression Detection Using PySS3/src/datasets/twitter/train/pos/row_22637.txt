Hey, anyone wants to watch a movie together? All U need is Netflix account, theres a plugin that helps u with that! Details bellow â¤ So yeah im 17, from Eu. Lately got a VPN so im scrolling threw bunch of new movies etc. 
Im really excited to see them but watching stuff by myself makes me sad over the fact i am alone. 
Preferabley people from USA, as thats where i got my VPN set, but everyone else is welcome too.

Plugin i mentioned in title used to be named Netflix Party, nowdays its Tele Party, i can link it to u. U just click the link to open the show, click on the plugin icone - And thats it, ur in.
