Online learning is horrible for kids in abusive families I have to be at home all the time. My dad got laid off so *he's* home all the time too. He's really stressed and drinking a lot. I'm bothering him anytime I have to talk in class. I take up space with my books and schoolwork. School doesn't care if we don't have a computer or wifi. We're now required to keep our cameras on, so everyone at school can see that I live in a dump. If I have my microphone on, everyone can hear my dad watching TV or neighbors yelling in the background. My dad isn't careful anymore about how visible the bruises are. I'm losing weight because I can't get lunch at school. If we get evicted, which we probably will, it'll mean I'll have to drop out. 

Obviously I get that covid is a big deal and that going to school isn't an option and will just get everyone sick. But still, people really aren't thinking about how awful this is for kids with shitty home lives. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
