Dealing with sensory overload Hey guys! I realized that between anxiety and ADHD (And possible other things, Iâ€™m not sure) this might be a fairly common thing, I thought Iâ€™d share. Basically, sensory overload is when you get too overwhelmed that everything becomes a little too much. People chewing is too loud, people talking is annoying, every little sound is overwhelming, maybe other senses are getting worked up too (mine is usually auditory) so I thought I would share some of my coping mechanisms to help you guys out. 

1. Tell the people around you that youâ€™re dealing with sensory overload right now, so you might be a little snappier than usual. This seriously helps, because a lot of times people assume youâ€™re being rude.

2. Find a quiet space to distance yourself from other people. This helps your senses to reset and helps everything just calm down.

3. Do something easy and absorbing to help distract you. Do some meditation or some colouring. Something that doesnâ€™t require too much concentration. Iâ€™ve found that tasks with repetitive motions are very soothing.

4. Calming music like wind chimes can help as well.

These are all the things I could think of, let me know if you all have other things that help you. Cheers!
