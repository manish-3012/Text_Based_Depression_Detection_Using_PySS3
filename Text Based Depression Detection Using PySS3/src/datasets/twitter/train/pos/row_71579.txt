Fuck my life He treats me like fucking garbage when he hears the slightest talk back from me. Every time I slip up a little bit or get tired of doing literally fucking everything he asks of me, heâ€™ll take away my phone or my Xbox or both for days. I canâ€™t fucking stand it. Itâ€™s my only fucking source of entertainment and they treat it like some little thing that doesnâ€™t matter. I was already depressed from this summer being complete shit, but now this jerk has me losing my fucking mind. My dad is an insensitive jerk that will do anything to annoy me and then go ahead and take away my Xbox for calling him out. This feels fucking terrible and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. I do everything I can to make him care about me like  taking all honors classes in high school and doing other extra shit etc., and I have not once gotten an,â€Iâ€™m proud of youâ€. He is an apathetic jerk that I want nothing to do with. This goes all the way back to when I was a fucking 8 year old and I tried to get them to quit smoking after school Iâ€™ve tried to get them to stop every day since, but fuck it, Iâ€™m done. They can kill themselves if thatâ€™s what they want to do. And also I get angry and try to complain to them then they will give me THE FUCKING SILENT TREATMENT. Iâ€™m their fucking son and they donâ€™t even care when Iâ€™m fucking crying my ass off just trying to get a point across, they will just say something like,â€We careâ€, or â€œstop cryingâ€. They have never taught me anything and I have nothing to learn from them. I give up. If anyone has advice on what I should do please help with this.
