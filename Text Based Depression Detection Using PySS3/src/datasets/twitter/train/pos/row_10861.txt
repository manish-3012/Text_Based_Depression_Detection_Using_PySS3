Ever vibe to a 7am morning sunrise through your window ? Last night I was up until 7am and I seen the white light through my blinds and my room was like this faintish dark area. Wish that 7am sunrise would stay like that forever. 

If you are wonder I was watching anime (Captain harlock from the 90â€™s)
