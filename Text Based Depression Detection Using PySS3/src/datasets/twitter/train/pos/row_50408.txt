American politics confuses me Why is everything so extreme!?!?!? Why is it that your either hard left, or hard right. No in between?! Why does everyone on both sides have the *exact same ideology without any differences in opinion. What the fuck is wrong 
with their news??? Its so biased! Its not news if its 90% opinion


I swear, if America had a parliment system, it would be much better off. People wouldn't be so extreme with their political choices
