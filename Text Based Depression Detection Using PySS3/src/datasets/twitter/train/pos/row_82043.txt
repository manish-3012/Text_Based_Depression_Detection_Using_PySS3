I used to worry that Iâ€™d turn gay... Like I wasnâ€™t homophobic or anything. i was more just worried of idk what. Idk why this was a worry of mine back in middle school. But Iâ€™m whenever I beat my shmeat i would worry about looking at the guy. But now Iâ€™ve realized that it is a lot more relaxing and just more fulfilling now that it doesnâ€™t bother. This might be me coming out as bi or maybe something else. Iâ€™m still figuring it out.
