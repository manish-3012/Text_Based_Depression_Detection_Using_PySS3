My Girlfriend loves smelling feet. I  dated a girl once who always asked to smell my bare feet. I thought it  was weird when she first asked and would take off my shoes and socks at  her front door. She would get upset if I washed my feet before I saw  her, so I stopped showering beforehand. I asked my friend one time to  observe and go with me and she ended up taking his shoes and socks off  too. She fell in love with his bare feet and ended up dumping me the  next day. I didnâ€™t mind since I thought she was weird. I kept my feet  groomed and pedicured, but always didnâ€™t smell the best even with foot  powder.  
My friend told me later that she went beyond smelling his  bare feet and toes. She began to lick his bare soles and suck on his  toes. He was weirded out by her doing that. He ended up dumping her  quickly afterwards.
