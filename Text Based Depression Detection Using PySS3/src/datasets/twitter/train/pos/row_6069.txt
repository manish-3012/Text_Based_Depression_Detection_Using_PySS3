Help please. What can I do? I am a 13 y.o from Turkey.

What can I do to gain money, via online or irl things. I really want to buy a few stuff for myself, but dont want to jeopardize my family's economy.

I can translate English to Turkish, or Turkish to English, I can cook, and I can draw but its mostly shit.Any advice will be good for me, honestly. I have no where to post this, so I chose this subreddit mostly because of that.

Please, I need your advices. And mostly, please be serious with your replies.
