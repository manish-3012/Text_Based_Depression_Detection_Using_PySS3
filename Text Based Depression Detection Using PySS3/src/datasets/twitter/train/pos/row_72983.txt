Our principal slept with a secretary in the school gym, threatens to suspend/expel students if they refused to let him search their phones, and created a Instagram account posing as a student, trying to get other students to incriminate each other. My principal is the worst. I go to school in Michigan. Our principal slept with a secretary in the school gym, threatens to suspend/expel students if they refused to let him search their phones, and created a Instagram account posing as a student, trying to get other students to incriminate each other. Some of this must be illegal, right?
