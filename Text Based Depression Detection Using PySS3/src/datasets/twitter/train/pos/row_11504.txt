I wrote this, wanna know if it's good. Criticism is welcome "Who am I?"
 
If someone asked me what I am, I'd simply reply that I am the sum of my genetics and the events that have taken place during the course of my life. The answer to someone asking who I am, however, would be a lot longer.
 
 
I am a son, a brother, and a friend. I am a student but also an educator. I am an avid reader and I write creatively. My interests differ largely: like a butterfly, I flutter from one flower to another, spreading my big beautiful wings, sucking nectar. I am both an amateur perfumer and a martial artist; a video gamer and a philosopher. I admire both the natural and that made by man; Orwell and Shakespeare; Sinatra and Motorhead. 
 
 
An ideal day of my life would include hiking all the way up to a secluded hill, reading a book, probably reading Matsuo Basho's Haikus, sitting under the shade of a big Oak tree, and munching on something that I had probably cooked while dancing to an old Edith Piaf song. I would then collect some Roses that I could make perfumes with and head home. At home, I would build myself a cozy blanket fort and fall asleep in it while watching one of those horror shows that are on TLC and Discovery Channel late at night.
 
 
I love learning new things and my ability to learn things quickly has only complemented that. Even when I was young, while other students liked to play outside, I preferred staying home, trying to memorise dictionaries and reading about different cultures. In the past few months alone, Iâ€™ve learned things like knitting, repairing bicycles, 3D Modelling, and making BÃ©chamel sauce Pasta, my own signature dish. I have questioned and, in turn, discarded all the beliefs about race, religion, sexuality, and caste that were wrongly forced onto me at a very young age. I have come so far and have learned and experienced so much, yet I feel that it is not enough. The amount of knowledge that exists in the world, overwhelms me and makes me feel like a butterfly with so many flowers around it that no matter how much nectar it sucks there would still be more.
 
 
 I am ambitious and have large goals. Inspired by schools like the Academy and Deep Springs, I too aspire to start my own school. An alternative to modern education, if you may, the school would focus on teaching students critical thinking and help them gain a deeper understanding of the world, its cultures, and, in turn, of themselves. It is my belief that by providing others with better education, I can make a change. I believe that I, too, like a butterfly, can cause a storm by merely flapping my wings.
 
 
Who I am is ever-changing. With each passing day, my beliefs change, for the better, and I become a more learned and refined version of myself. Like Heraclitus believed, I, along with every other thing in the universe, am in a constant state of flux. Therefore, the question, â€œWho am I?â€ can only be answered accurately when I cease to change. And as I continue to evolve, I believe the question cannot be answered for the time being.
