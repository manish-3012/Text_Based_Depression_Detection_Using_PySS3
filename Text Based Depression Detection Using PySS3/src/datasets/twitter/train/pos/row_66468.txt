I HATE SLUGS WITH A PASSION I WENT TO GO PEE AND SO I SAT DOWN AND ALL WAS FINE UNTIL I LOOKED DOWN AND THERE WAS JUST A SLUG AND I WAS LIKE MMMMM NO THANKYOU AND DASHED THE HELL OUT OF THERE AND LET THE SLUG KEEP THE BATHROOM. I THEN DECIDED TO SALT THE FRICKER BUT I WENT THERE AND IT WAS GONE AND I WAS LIKE FRICK THAT NOISE AND SO ANYWAYS PACKING MY BAGS AND MOVING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. YA GIRL IS NOT DEALING WITH THIS SLUG IT IS STILL AT LARGE.
