A girl gave me her number, and I lost it. We were in history class and she ran up to me and tore a slip of paper out of her notebook and wrote her number down and said "text me". I zoned out and shoved it into my backpack and was like "okay". Went and played Minecraft with the boys on discord later that day and forgot about it completely

2 months later I realized that she *gave me her number*, and how stupid I was. I liked her, too.

Don't be me guys. Please just don't be me
