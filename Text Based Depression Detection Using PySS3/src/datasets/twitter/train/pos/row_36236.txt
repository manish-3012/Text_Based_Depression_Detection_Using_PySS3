I saved my sisters fish My sister got a goldfish at the fair last year, and somehow it is still alive. It is in a bowl in our kitchen. So here I am, chillin in the kitchen, when in the corner of my eye I see something with a yellowish color flopping on the table. I thought it was a moth flying around. I look over and its this motherfucking fish trying to kill its self or something. This guy just up and hopped out of the bowl. And its a big bowl too. I run over and put the little guy back in his bowl with his friends, my other two sisters fish. These are goldfish of STEEL. Most goldfish last like a couple of months max, these guys are going a year and 2 months strong and one nearly suffocated.
