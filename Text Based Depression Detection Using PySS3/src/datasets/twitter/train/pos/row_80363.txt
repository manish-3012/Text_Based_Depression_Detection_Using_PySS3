I hate this I didnâ€™t get a chance to tell her how I felt before she moved pretty far away from me. Iâ€™ve told myself to move on but when she likes one of my memes on my insta or sends me the rare one I just canâ€™t seem to shake it. Iâ€™ve known her for years maybe since I was in 3rd grade or around that age and I liked her then too. The week she stayed in town, even though I didnâ€™t show it, it was for sure my happiest moment out of these past 3-ish years. I tried to tell her how I felt but her little brother was always there so the best I could do is just say I missed them but I rlly just wanted to say I miss her the most. Iâ€™m not even sure how she felt about me, I thought she gave signs but at the same time I donâ€™t think so, maybe sheâ€™s just a really kind person and Iâ€™m thinking too hard. I want to keep in contact but at the same time I want to move on so bad.
