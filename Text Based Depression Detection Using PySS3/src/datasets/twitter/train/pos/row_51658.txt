Welp, my whole life is going to shit. My I feel outcast by my two best friends who I've known for 9 years now. I haven't got a single aspiration (no crush, no dreams, no goals). I am slightly below average in every measurable field, if 4.5/10 was ever a person, it was me. Everyone who knows of my existence thinks I'm a joke. I only feel two things, pain, and nothing. For the past two days I've felt like my soul is rotting from the inside out. The worst part is, there is no escape.

Anyway, how is your life going?
