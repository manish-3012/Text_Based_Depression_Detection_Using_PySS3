I want my knives back(TW:self harm) So my mom took my knives when I told her I was depressed (I cut for a few months before that) and she still doesnâ€™t know how bad my depression is (I would tell her but she will use it as leverage against me like she always does) and I really wish I could cut again to feel something.
