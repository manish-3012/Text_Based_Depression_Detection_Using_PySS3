How could you help somebody with depression? I have a friend that is very depressed and I wanted to ask you people on Reddit if you might know any ways I could help. She has been dealing with it for almost this whole year now and had been on anti depressants for around a month. The first few weeks it seemed the medicine was working but as of now I donâ€™t think itâ€™s helping. I try to text her sometimes but hardly ever replys, not to be rude she just really doesnâ€™t have the energy. 

Does anybody here know how I could help?
