A message to all reddit DO NOT and I mean DO NOT post art.

Reddit is like that.  If it ain't hentai, its downvoted.  I aint a good artist, and I dont draw often, but when I get a thing done I like to get praise for it.  Maybe it's in my cubistic and rough art style, but maybe it's because yall are pieces of shit.

Only a masochist willingly posts art to Reddit.  I had a friend once get bullied off the platform for a minor flaw, and they said they shouldn't expect praise for pouring their soul into something.  That's what I've learned here.  Agree with the hivemind, make memes, and you will be awarded.  Deviancy is awarded in bullying.

I fucking hate it here.  Fuck you all.
