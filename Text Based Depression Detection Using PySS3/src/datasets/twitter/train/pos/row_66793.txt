From one teenager to other Hi. I (20M) don't have an idea what the fu*k is happening around me. I have friends but I don't have "best" friends. I have been nothing but good to them but they don't invite me anywhere. I helped them a lot. Don't know what I am going to do in the future. I lost all of my motivation. I started exercising and lost 5kg but gained 7kg in 2 months. I feel depressed all the time. Like unnecessary depression. Whenever I am happy, some thought crosses my mind and I am unhappy again. My birthday is in 2 days and I am not excited at all. All I get are happy birthday messages but no one ever calls me. I am an introvert. But I mingle with a small group of people that are my "friends". It's like sometimes I am ashamed of one of my group of friends. Like I don't wanna hangout with them but they are the only ones I got in my college. I didn't use social media for a week and it felt great but I started using it again only for the small dose of dopamine. I tried to get some advice on r/ advice but I didn't get anything. I am not doing this for karma. I have enough karma. I am doing this because I need help. Nothing is interesting to me anymore. I am a car geek now cars don't interest me anymore. Like wtf!!!?? What is even happening? Seriously guys any kind of help would be deeply appreciated and forgive if my english is not that good it is my second language.
