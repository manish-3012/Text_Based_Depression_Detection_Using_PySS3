How Do I Know if a Girl Wants To Talk To Me? So this girl and I have been talking a bit, as friends, and we've worked on 2 projects together. We're both introverts and not very social, but we've been texting a bit, in a pretty 2 sided conversation. But I'm not so sure if she's just replying and talking to not be rude, or if she actually wants to talk? It's a bit hard to "read" body language and emotions over text, so does anyone have any tips for determine if she's just trying to be polite or just doesn't like to start conversations?
