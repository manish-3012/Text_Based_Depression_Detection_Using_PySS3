My mum doesn't leave me alone I just wanted to ask people that may do the same thing, I do indeed have a friend that i can talk to but that is limited to discord when he is online, so i just compromised and started talking to myself and discovered allot in no time.

When I do talk to my self (which is about all the time), i find a quite place with no people or family near, as i don't have my own room (we are not poor, i just prefer it and we live in a small house) so i usually use my balcony, i just talk about what ever i want, but yesterday my mum came to me and shouted at me for a good hour that i was going crazy and the 15 minutes a spend talking to my self i can spend studying.

Is this normal? am I actually crazy? am I going crazy? does someone else do this?

can someone tell me please.
