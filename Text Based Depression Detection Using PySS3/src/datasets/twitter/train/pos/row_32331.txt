How do I stop worrying? Worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to do, but doesnâ€™t get you anywhere. 

When the situation is out of my hands, I donâ€™t worry at all. Iâ€™m all good

But when I have control, thatâ€™s when everything kicks in. When I worry, I go into a state of thinking, and that thinking produces results for me.
