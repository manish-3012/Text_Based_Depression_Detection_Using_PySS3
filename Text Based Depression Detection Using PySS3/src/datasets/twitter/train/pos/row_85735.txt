Iâ€™m within single day driving distance of basically everything west of New Mexico Also southern British Columbia and a good portion of northern Mexico 

Driving distance basically means under 16 hours of continuous driving 

Yet somehow the furthest east and south Iâ€™ve been is Los Angeles, and the farthest north Iâ€™ve been is Vancouver Washington
