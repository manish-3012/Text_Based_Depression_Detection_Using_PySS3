I want to say what I think should be a rule of dating, if its not already, idk any rules cause i don't date people. If you have a friend group of you and 2 other people, no one in that friend group should date another person in that friend group. 

Why? Because the 3rd person is like a 3rd wheel or that 3rd person would get left out of things.

My (only) friend group is me and 2 guys. The 2 guys are straight and don't wanna date anyone rn and then I'm aroace. I just thought of this one day like "what would happen if a friend group of 3 contains a couple? That would be unfortunate for that 3rd person."
