Here, have a quote "There's so many stories where some brave hero decides to give their life to save the day...

And because of their sacrifice, the good guys win, the survivors all cheer, and everybody lives happily ever after. But the hero... Never gets to see that ending...

Theyâ€™ll never know if their sacrifice actually made a difference. Theyâ€™ll never know if the day was really saved. In the end, they just have to have faith.

Ainâ€™t that a bitch?"
