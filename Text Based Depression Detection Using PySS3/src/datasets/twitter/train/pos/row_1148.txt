Is friendship just,, not for me? Couple months ago, my best friend left me. I don't have many friends so she was quite important to me and so her leaving was painful. Because she was such a large part of my life, now I don't know what to do with myself. However, this has got me thinking. This isn't the first time something like this has happened. It's happened twice before, in almost the exact way. I get to know someone, we get extremely close and mean a lot to each other, then out of nowhere everything starts to go downhill and they lose interest in me or something and leave. Idk what it is specifically cause they never tell me. This is the 3rd time it's happened in a row, so I'm starting to see a pattern here that leads me to believe I'm not cut out for relationships with other people. Probably my fault, maybe I'm too emotionally immature or I'm far too boring once you get to know me? No idea. So I guess at least for now, I need to just be by myself until I know how to keep friends.
