Iâ€™m debating whether I should do a yoonbum cosplay Now Iâ€™m not gonna post it or anything, but I just think I could do a really good one since we look pretty similar and I found the dress and shirt online 

So kinda just for myself or something, but Iâ€™m not sure what my parents would think and I would probably have a hard time explaining who he is to them

Iâ€™m just saying it could be really cool or cause very awkward conversations with my parents 

Maybe Iâ€™ll just do it next Halloween idk
