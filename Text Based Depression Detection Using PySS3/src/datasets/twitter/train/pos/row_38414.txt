How do you know when you are ready for a relationship ? As a 14 yo straight female, I have never been in a relationship before and I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll be ready for one. Guys have asked me out in the past but I have always declined out of fear. How will I know when Iâ€™m ready and is there anything I need to do to get ready for it?

Like I really want for someone to care about me like that but Iâ€™m also scared of the thought of it
