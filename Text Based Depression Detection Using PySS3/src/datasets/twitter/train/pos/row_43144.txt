My biggest achievement ever... In our school we used to have elocution competitions...every one used to write notes which were pages long for the day of the competition and the thing was...I didnâ€™t even know that day was the competition...so I didnâ€™t prepare anything..I didnâ€™t even know the topic! They went roll number wise calling the students.....mine was the last 3rd so I just sat down listening to what the others were saying and put together all the important points and adding my own sentences..and said what ever came to my mind...and out of 90 students out of the the grade only 5 students were picked to go to the finals...and guess what...I went to the finals! The now my biggest flex this happened TWICE! The first one was when I was in 6th grade and the second one was in 7th grade and both years I didint even know the topic and still made it..Iâ€™m in 8th grade now and due to COVID this years elocution competition was canceled...
