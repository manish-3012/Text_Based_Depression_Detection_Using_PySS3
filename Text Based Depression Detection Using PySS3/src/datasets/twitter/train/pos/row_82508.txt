Vent (Mega Warning) TW I think my dad wants me to off myself. He be littles me and pushes me until I feel like an empty shell of a person. He refused to get me therapy even though I really need it. He brushes off my anxiety and depression as being dramatic and a teenager and tells me to suck it up and get over myself because life's shit and you need to be grown up and just deal with it. But it is most definitely not just drama. I've developed tics from my anxiety... I have tugged and scratched my scalp until it's raw and bleeding. I bite and pluck at my lips the same way. My nails are next to none existent because I chew them to bits. But he ignores all these things because he wants to believe he's raised perfect children, and we shouldn't have any trauma or issues because he's a "magnificent" father and we should be grateful he raised us so well. He only got my sister therapy because she was threatening to kill herself if he didn't. I feel like your children shouldn't feel like thy need to threaten to murder themselves to make you agree to getting them help. But here we are, him fat shaming me and ruining my slight uphill and telling me I'm useless and worthless and how I'm such a lazy, phone obsessed and self absorbed child for not feeding his several thousand dollar horse. He only cares about his stupid farm and equipment and horses and cows. I've never been so far down before..... And I can't even tell my friends because they told me they're tired of being my therapists.... So.... Maybe the world would be better off without me..... But I'm too much of a coward to face death yet.....
