I really want to know... 
Why is it so hard to find someone to vibe with?

All I want is someone to listen to loud music with while we lay around eating food, smoking, and drinking. Not having a care in the world and just basking in how irrelevant and small we are that we can do whatever we want. 

I just want some mad juicy vibes.
