I'm scared by the fact that the mobile version of nfs could bring back Razor's car with an explanation unlike the pc nfs games Like seriously ea brings back that car as a bait so the game won't be considered trash. While in the mobile version razor is also present and there's a modern version of his mustang and also the bmw ( both the m3 and the m4). I know people hate mobile games but there are some good ones too
