Suffering from sadness and other stuff Okay here is the stuff. I didn't talk to my crush for 2,5 months, I can't talk to her anymore and I still love her so it's so painful. When I tried to meet with my friend something happened and we didn't. Now we can't beacuse virus is getting more and more dangerous. I'm always tired even if I don't do anything (maybe that's the reason why I'm tired). I don't even join to online classes and I can't study by myself either beacuse I don't have any motivation. Idk how to get better, I'm trying but I'm clearly terrible at trying.
