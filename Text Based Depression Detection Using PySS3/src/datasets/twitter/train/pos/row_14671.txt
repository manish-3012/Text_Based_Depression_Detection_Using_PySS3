Requesting help from the reddit homies So, I really want to tell my crush how i feel about her but i don't know how to do it. I just need to confess to her, because my feelings are starting to get in the way of my schoolwork. Social anxiety really helps me here as well. 

TL;DR: i need help confessing to my crush.
