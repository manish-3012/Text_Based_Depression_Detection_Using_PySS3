K so I just ate ramen And I donâ€™t mean like the packaged stuff. havenâ€™t eaten it since 2019 cause covid. It was really good. But the best part was that I texted my friends saying that Iâ€™m eating ramen and my friend texted back â€œyou are a bold green dogâ€ and Iâ€™m so confused. What does this mean.
