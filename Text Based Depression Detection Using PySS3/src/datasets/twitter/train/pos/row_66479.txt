Me and many other men and women are suffering from an addiction that is disregarded and not helped as much as the others The addiction of porn (yes this can be considered an addiction if it gets out of hand) is an addiction that many people have to deal with, including me. You may say, just say no. But it's like a cigarette, you have the extremely strong urge to go back, and return. Like heroin, starts off innocent with a wine cooler, then some whiskey, maybe some pot, then pills, then crack, then that gets too expensive and you move to heroin. Porn starts off innocent, and then it gets weirder and weirder. But no one pays any mind to the problem.
