Highschool Study Group/Accountability Partners Hey all! I was wondering if anyone wanted to join a study/accountability group. I'm asking bc I suck at online school, and it's really hard to even start on schoolwork, especially if you're alone, and have ADHD, like me lol

I would either make one on Tumblr, or Discord, but not both. It depends on what the majority of y'all want. 

If anyone's interested then I'll link a poll.

Edit: realized I can't make a poll. 

So just tell me which platform you want me to make it on and I'll go with the majority 
:) 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!! 


P.S. if there's any college students here, you can definitely join if you want! I would really appreciate it if you could give some advice, or even tutor if you're interested!

Thanks!
