I lost my best friend and l feel sick... l lost my best friends this week. l feel very sick. Long story short my best friend didnt take my side and was laughing at me being down which is unacceptable for me. Loyallity is a what l am looking for in a friend. After he betrayed me l stopped communicating with him and he didnt text me at all he waited for me to do it which made me distance from him even more (l was the one that wasnt talking to him not the other way around). Today l saw my best friend with one other close friend of mine and they didnt even say hi to me (l of course said hi because l am not mad l am just dissapointed from him). From the eyes of my other friend l could tell that my ex best friend talked shit behind my back. Both of them dont text me anymore which is just sad. He was just too butthurt to say sorry and he lost me. I am not regretting anything because l saw his true form and l am happy l made my choice. It is really painful when you lose someone who is like a brother to you, someone who knows more secrets about you than your parents but we cant change the past and life continues!

Here is what happened - I got a speeding ticket and l was very depressed (200$ ticket and the car is registered to my dad so he got the ticket not me). Instead of helping me feel better he said its my fault (which it is but that is not the way you say it) and started laughing at me at how stupid l was (he didnt say it but he showed it). If l were in his place l would say that everything will be better and that l will learn from my mistakes and not do it again. I wanted to teach him a lesson and make him find out why l am not talking with him. Instead he just straight up ignored me for 2 weeks. We study in the same school so we see each other every day. When we first met he confronted me why l am not texting him and l told him he has to think of the reason himself.
