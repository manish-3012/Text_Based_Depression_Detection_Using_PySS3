Not a "real" teenager. I've wasted a big part of my life. I rarely drink, have never been to a party where alcohol was present and I don't vape. I've only had 2 boyfriends. Never snuck out because my parents let me stay out as long as I want. 

And because of all these things i don't feel like a real teenager. I feel like a fake POS. Like I wasted my teen years. Why do I feel like this you may ask? Because all my sisters and all the movies I watch this is the criteria for teens. To have fun constantly. To create memories that when you're old you can look back on and be like "ah the good old days" And I do have fun, just not in the typical ways a teen should I guess. I've skipped class a few times, smoke green , have a job, and license and am about to graduate HS with an associates degree. And just got accepted into University.  I hang with freinds, go thrifting, go hiking, hang out with my dog. 

Obviously covid has put a stop to a big part of the highschool years. But i still feel like i wasted my life. 

Do any of you feel like you've wasted the supposed "best years of your life".
