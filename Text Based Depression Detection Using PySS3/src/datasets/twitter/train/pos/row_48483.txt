Do you ever sit back and look at a something you made like "I coulda made it better a month ago" Ok so I have a REALLY small instagram dedicated to my art, and I looked at my recent posts compared to my first ones and I'm just like "I think I got worse." 

Is that just me? And how do I get back to being good?
