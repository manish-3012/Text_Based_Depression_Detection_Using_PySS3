Done with BLM and COVID No I am not against BLM at all, donâ€™t attack me, Iâ€™m not trying to disprove it or anything like that.

Iâ€™m just kind of done with both sides. BLM people saying you need to go out and protest and COVID regulations saying you need to stay inside ya know? I support the movement, but every time I say I donâ€™t want to protest or I donâ€™t want to donate because my family isnâ€™t the beat off financially so Iâ€™m really trying to save, I get called racist by people I know and how horrible of a person I am. (Definitely not saying all people say you need to go protest, but the majority of people I know around me do.)

Iâ€™ve had multiple friends get pissy with me for not going out into these massive protests with them. I have grandparents I take care of and I canâ€™t risk getting COVID and putting their life in danger. Itâ€™s just gotten so annoying that Iâ€™ve stayed off a lot of social media to get a break from all of it.

I mean is that wrong of me? I support the movement for the most part. (I say this as I havenâ€™t fully looked into it. Small sections do seem radical, but those donâ€™t seem to be for the actual movement so whatever.) But Iâ€™m just not willing to give up money or put my grandparents at risk to support it. Iâ€™m just tired of people constantly calling me racist because of this.
