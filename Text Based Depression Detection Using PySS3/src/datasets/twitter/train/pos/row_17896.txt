So one of my best friends got a boyfriend, and now I'm the only one that's single in the group I am very very happy for her, truly glad! but at the same time, I am dreadfully reminded of the fact that I'm single af and will probably never really find anyone. Yea I'm a guy btw, so y'all understand what I mean. Thanks for listening, have a great day ahead! Stay safe fam!
