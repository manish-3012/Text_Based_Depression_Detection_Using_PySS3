My parents took away my phone because I was not studying enough... Sorry Karen that I dont have as high grades as my brother who is going for cumlaude also they thinking they are helping me this way and that they doing it for me even though I never asked to be helped and getting a good education and a high paying job is not even something I care about, also this new update sucks idc what anything says I hate these new reddit profile pic my old one was fine...
