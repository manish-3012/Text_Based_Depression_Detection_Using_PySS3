How do we revive mall culture. My older brother always tells me to go to the mall instead of going on my phone. He always tells me that social media is gen zâ€™s version of the mall. The mall was basically as used as social media is now by teens. Iâ€™ve gone to the mall but itâ€™s kind of awkward cause thereâ€™s no other teens there. He showed me the movie â€œmallratsâ€ and it looks so much fun. Teens just always at the mall, having stupid fun, living life outside of a screen, having REAL social interactions. It looks so much better than social media. How do I revive the culture of going to the mall, riding bikes, doing stupid thing among my friend groups?
