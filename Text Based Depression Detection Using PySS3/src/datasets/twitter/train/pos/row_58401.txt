It's over I had a brief fling with this girl in my hall...we met, a day later we ran into each other in the dining center, and the next day we were mostly naked in my bed. 

We were gonna have a first date this evening but she isn't interested...she hit me with the "I can't".

I'm not devastated, since I was sorta prepared for it, but I'm still a little sad about it.
