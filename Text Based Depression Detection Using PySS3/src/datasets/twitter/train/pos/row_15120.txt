Fuck tertiary color names. Why in the hell do the names of tertiary colors printed on crayons have to be so damn lazy?? Red-violet? Blue-violet? Red-orange? Blue-green? They have other names you know! Why does crayola and every other crayon/colored pencil company do this? What happened to names like Teal, Vermilion, and Magenta? Why must these color companies pretend these names don't exist? They're very memorable and much better than the laziness we've been stuck with for who knows how long.
