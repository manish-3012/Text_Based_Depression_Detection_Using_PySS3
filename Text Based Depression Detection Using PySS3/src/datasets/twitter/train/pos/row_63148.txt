My Theory on Wahmens My theory is simple, girls donâ€™t exist.


I know what your thinking, â€œwhat the fuck does he mean girls donâ€™t exist, that doesnâ€™t make any sense?â€. Well if you would stop being such a sheep for just one minute I can make you awake. 


If girls existed then more of us would have girlfriends, correct? But all I see on this sub is how weâ€™re all single, lonely, depressed, beating off every night to briefly distract ourselves from the void that is our singularity. That is how I drew my conclusion that girls donâ€™t exist.

But if girls donâ€™t exist how does the human race carry on? Easy, girls died out around the 1700â€™s Iâ€™d say. Since then the people who have â€œgirlfriendsâ€ and â€œwivesâ€, have actually been having sex with the robots from Rick and Mortyâ€™s â€œRaising Gazorpazorpâ€. If there is a â€œgirlâ€ out there that wants to prove me wrong my dmâ€™s are open (please god dm me Iâ€™m so lonely).
