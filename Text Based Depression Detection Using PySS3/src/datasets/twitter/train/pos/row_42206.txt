Dear mods of r/teenagers Since people really be posting selfieâ€™s on this subreddit which is quite annoying when everyone does it. So I had an idea... what about â€˜selfie Saturday or Sundayâ€™? If everyone posts their selfieâ€™s on one of those days... it would be a better browse experience (during the week)
