Iâ€™m on the verge of breaking down... I move into my dorm tomorrow, yup, freshman year, just graduated high school like two months ago. Itâ€™s almost midnight right now so like less than a day before I move in. I just had a fight with my parents about how they really want to buy me a car but I refused, saying itâ€™s my first year. Then they make up excuses saying how I should come back home on the weekends or go anywhere I want. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have time for that. Besides, I donâ€™t want a car just sitting right outside the parking lot. I havenâ€™t even started packing yet, donâ€™t worry I have the supplies and everything, just not in order. I have like a major speech disorder which doesnâ€™t make me talk a lot like I would say something then I stop in between.

Iâ€™m not very stable right now so please at least be gentle. I feel like I want to kill someone and then kill myself because that was always my goal whenever Iâ€™m breaking down, which is to take my life and anotherâ€™s.

Iâ€™m crying so hard as Iâ€™m typing this. I really fucking hate this shit.
