This sucks So I'm a Christian, and I've always thought of the church I've been going to for the past few years as great. The teaching is generally really good. But they really have lost some of my respect through this whole pandemic, they aren't mandating masks to be worn during services and are treating COVID like a joke. My mom and I agree that it's irresponsible and we're not attending in person for now because of their carelessness. I just don't understand why they can't do the decent thing and take this seriously?! And then on top of that their first service back in the building we watched online and the pastor was basically shaming people for being afraid to come to church! I mean yes I agree that we should be together in fellowship but if you want people to come why don't you do your part to make sure it's safe! And my youth group is the same, they don't wear masks, and I really liked this youth group. I haven't seen people my age often these past few months, obviously, so I was looking forward to when we would be able to meet again. Now I can't go because they're not being safe!
