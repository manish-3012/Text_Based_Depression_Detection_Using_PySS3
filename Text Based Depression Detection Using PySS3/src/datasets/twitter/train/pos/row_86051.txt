Is she dropping hints? So I'm friends with a girl from school who is kinda cute. Yesterday and a few times before me and my friends were hanging and drinking Punsch out after school, but I had to drive home so I had to stay sober.

Yesterday she tried  to get me drunk and got me food. At the evening, she really wanted me to stay over (asked me last week as well) and we even watched her favorite Porn together (idk what that means). Also she flirts with me a lot. 

Now her friend told me that I had to stay the night with her and but I don't know if she wants that as well.

So anyways, do you guys think I'm in the Friendzone or she is interested? I know she has a crush on another guy too. Thanks for reading and love you bros
