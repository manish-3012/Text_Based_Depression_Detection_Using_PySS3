NNN is not possible. I mean assuming you did NNN last year, you must've.. *did it* for the past 11 months. Your body, being very smart, decides to incorporate *the act of pleasuring yourself* as a daily or weekly thing.

And suddenly you decide to overturn the table, loudly declaring "I will NNN. I will not give in.".

Your mind might not give in, but your body's on the way already.
