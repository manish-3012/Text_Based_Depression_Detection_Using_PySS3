Anyone wanting to try weed or curious about it? I've posted this before but it was really late so not many people saw it so imma just repost it. I'm 16 and been smoking for a year now. 5 days ago I finally decided to put it down because it started to affect my life (smoking 24/7 takes a toll). I've been experiencing some withdrawals and what makes it easier is talking to other people about it. Articles online are very vague in terms of how it feels and stuff like that so I am here to answer personal questions you might have about this plant.

I don't think weed is bad, as long as you don't use it like I did.

Anyways, if you are curious or want to try it and want to know in detail what it feels like, how it works, how long, etc. ask away!
