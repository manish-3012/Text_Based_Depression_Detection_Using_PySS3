A favour Does anyone have a Facebook account that has been around for at least a year, that has nothing on it, and isnâ€™t used? I need one thatâ€™s at least a year old. Donâ€™t ask me why it needs to be a year old because honestly, Iâ€™m not sure. I just need one thatâ€™s over a year old, isnâ€™t being used, and if you can remove everything that was previously on there, thatâ€™d be cool also.
