Bruh I just had this guy in my class present an essay about how how thinks girls shouldnâ€™t be able to abort babies even if the baby is a product of rape. He said â€œItâ€™s still a life no matter whatâ€. Someone asked him â€œIf your little sister got raped would you want her to go through with the birth. He deadass said â€œYes because the father should have a say too. Itâ€™s a life and I would never let her get rid of itâ€

Holy fuck I didnâ€™t think people could actually be like this it angers me.
