You know what hurts When the only person who you care to talk to, who cares to talk to you, who brought you out of your dark place in life, your closest friend, your world and every reason you are happy, makes it feel like Iâ€™m too much. 

Itâ€™s not her fault. Itâ€™s my fault. Sheâ€™s dealing with so much more than me but I fucked up yesterday. I freaked out and almost put myself into a panic attack for HOURS. I feel like a fucking moron and I just want to talk to her about it but every time I send her something I feel worse cause I know Iâ€™m being annoying and I feel like Iâ€™m pushing her away. Sheâ€™s the only person I care to share my life with and frankly, the only person who cares. Well at least â€œpretends to careâ€. Iâ€™m emotionally drained and I just need to talk to someone but I canâ€™t cause if I do they might tell my parents Iâ€™m not doing well and the last thing I need is my parents and all my friends suddenly talking to me cause Iâ€™m not doing good. Iâ€™m tired of living but Iâ€™m not gonna end it. I just wish something ended it for me.
