Me and my friend had a very depressing chat We both were talking about how we haven't been genuinely happy or excited for years and how its sad that we can relate on that. 

It made me feel better about it I guess but I always thought of her as the extroverted always happy person. 

At least today we opened up to eachother alot more than im used to, especially on some touchy topics. :|
