Do you have any advice to someone that has a crush on their best friend? So I love my best friend, I once asked her to be my gf two years ago but she told me that she wasn't ready for a relationship (because of her depression and anxiety). 

How do you show them indirectly that you are still interested?

How do you know if they are without directly asking them?

I would be thankful for anything really, if u have some experience that u want to share.

Thx! Have a nice day!
