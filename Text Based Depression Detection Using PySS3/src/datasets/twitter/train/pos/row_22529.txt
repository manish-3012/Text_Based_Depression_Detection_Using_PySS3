bad valentines day PLS read whole post Hello you all,

&amp;#x200B;

yesterday a girl i know (that i dont speak evey often with) said she liked me through a song (ALL I WANT from olivia rodrigo.) she confessed she liked me. but i searched for the wrong lyrics, and now i am feeling so stupid. and i am thinking about what if. but i didn't have feelings for her. we both said that we are better of as friends and maybe in future there will be something (who Knows) . and now she isnt responding. I know maybe she is sad. but its now starting to freak me out.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need some more details let me know. but its goes to a certain extend.

Thank you all in advance for helping me!
