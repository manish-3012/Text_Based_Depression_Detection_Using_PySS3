How does this message for asking my crush out sound? "Hey, uh, Sarah, this is going to be a pretty long, possibly awkward, message. You know that Iâ€™ve had a crush on you for a while now. Iâ€™m just going to be upfront and ask you out. If you donâ€™t want to for absolutely any reason, thatâ€™s fine. You do not have to explain anything to me, and hopefully, we can stay as friends. I am not going to pester you. So, are we cool?"
