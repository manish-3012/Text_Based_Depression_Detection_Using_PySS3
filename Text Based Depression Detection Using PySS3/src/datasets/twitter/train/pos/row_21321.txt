School indirectly makes me anxious. (TW: anxiety or something like that) I have death anxiety. Don't try to convince me there shouldn't be anything to be anxious about, cause it's like trying to convince an arachnophobe that spiders are not scary. I'm just here to get a question answered. Why is it that i only get anxious when it's school days? I am not usually stressed about tests or presentations, and i have a lot of good friends there, but there is no like stress at school. Why is it that during for example weekends or school breaks that i almost don't get anxious at all but i get anxious during school days? Also the time of day where i am the mist anxious is when i go to bed, right after i turn off my pc.
