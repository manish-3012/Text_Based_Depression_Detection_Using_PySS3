is it just my mother or do your parents also not want help with something, they just want to be mad at you and/or it? like seriously, what the hell? just today my mom asked me to help her set up an amazon account so that we can have the dog food delivered weekly. cool, I'm happy to help.

she got so fucking frustrated because she couldn't wrap her head around the fact that you need to provide your phone number, name, etc. etc. to make a amazon account, saying stuff like "they don't need to know all that" and "that's MY personal information" then got mad at me when there was no other way to do it.

another example: about a month ago she asked me for help with her laptop, she said "it's not letting me play my games" ok, cool, let's see what's up. apparently, she had filled the 32gb of EMMC storage on this HP craptop to the fucking brim, and thusly it wouldn't let her download any more.

I explained this to her, and then she got pissed at it because "it should automatically delete them" and "you should know how to fix it" 

mind you, I told her this would happen with this laptop, I would've happily built her a laptop that wouldn't do this, but she said "why would I do that when there's perfectly good ones at Walmart for half that price, and you wouldn't have to do all that" ok, sure, fuck it, I've argued this point with her before, there's no use in it, have it your way.

can anyone else relate?
