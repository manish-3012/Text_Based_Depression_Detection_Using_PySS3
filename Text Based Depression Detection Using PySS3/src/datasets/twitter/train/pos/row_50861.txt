Over quarantine... So over quarantine me and my friends wanted to stay in contact, right? So, we set up a weekly 1-hour zoom where we could all chat and hang out (sometimes play video games) now about this friend group, we're all-around 12, 5 girls, and me and another guy, and a lot of the girls disliked the guy but he was my friend, so yk. He starts an argument with one of the girls and there all fighting and at some point the guy asks me to back him up and turn on my camera, I do, I was eating Mac&amp;Cheese during it all, so i turn on my camera and they see it, and the guy goes, "Sam have you been paying attention at freaking all?!" and i ask "Paying attention to what?" my friends don't laugh (bc it isnt to funny) and they just role there eyes

Edit: yeeeeah we dont like that guy anymore, he then tried to ask out all 4 other girls over the coming month (they all said no)
