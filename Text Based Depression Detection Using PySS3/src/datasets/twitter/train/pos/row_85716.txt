so i just need to talk to someone about this so i had been dating this girl on and off for about six months and i just found out that she was making out with a guy that she told me not to worry about and was going to have sex with him. ik it shouldnâ€™t hurt me or make me this upset seeing as weâ€™re broken up but it just hurts so much and im so upset i feel like im about to throw up. this is the second time that a girl told me not to worry about a guy and then started dating them and stuff and i honestly feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me. ik this is going to seem like bs or for karma but i honestly dont care i j dont have anyone to talk to about it and writing it out makes me feel a bit better about the situation. :((

thank you for listening&lt;3
