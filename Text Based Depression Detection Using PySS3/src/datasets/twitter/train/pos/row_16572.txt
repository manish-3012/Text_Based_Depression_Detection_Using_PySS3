My dad just told me the same as always after a soccer match, it's your fault your team lost/draw I'm dutch so sorry for bad english. 
So i just had my first soccer game of this season and we played really good, and it was 2-1 for my team. 
I play 'mid-mid', at the center of the field and i had to run the whole match of 80 minutes.
This is the first 80 minutes long game we played and in the last 10 minutes i couldn't walk anymore, then the left-mid helped me and because of that the enemy scored. I was Switched with someone else, i almost couldn't walk anymore(it's still hard to walk, an hoir after the game).

After the game my dad told me alot of things but he basically meant: we drawed because of you, you're the worst and a dissapointment.
He is the reason i don't like soccer and to top it all of, MY DAD IS MY COACH

Tl:dr My dad is my coach and aways says after a game that i am the reason that we lost or drawed and i'm a dissapointment, even though i'm one of the better players of my team and give it everything i have.
