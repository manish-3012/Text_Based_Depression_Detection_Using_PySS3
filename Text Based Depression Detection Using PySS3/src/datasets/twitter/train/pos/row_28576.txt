I wish I could vote in the elections. I mean I know why minors can't vote, they're usually impressionable, immature, and lack experience, but I hate just sitting here and watching all this go down, sometimes I wish I could ever-so-slightly sway things. I'll be able to vote in 2024 though, so that's good.
