I just had an extremely awkward experience with a Zoom corona virus test So I'm going to summer camp in two weeks and before that you have to send in a covid test proving you won't spread the virus. You have to be monitored by one of the people who run the testing place while you take the test. So I'm on Zoom with this lady, and she tells me to take out the tube that I'm supposed to spit in, and says I have to fill it with spit up to a black line that is pretty near the top. I thought I was just gonna like really quick spit in this tube and get it over with, but apparently she needed to sit there and watch me spit nearly an entire fluid ounce of saliva into this tube. I hadn't drank any water in like three hours, and I wasn't allowed to get up and go drink something cause I could try to like tamper with the test or something. So my mouth was dry as a bone, and I was sitting there for twenty minutes trying my very hardest to get like every last drop of saliva from my mouth into that tube. The lady was just sitting there and she kept asking me "are you almost done," and it was like 1/4 of the way full. It took so long, but I finally filled the tube and I'm just very glad that its over. Sorry if it was like weird to hear a stranger rant about their saliva.
