Why am I like this Iâ€™m 123 pounds or so and about 5â€™5? (Iâ€™m a girl) and I always considered myself like 10 or a little less pounds overweight bc for me, a flat stomach was average/default. Just because I had always been skinny before but gained some weight in the last year or so. Am I overweight/fat? Like my weight is pretty nicely distributed so I donâ€™t really look bad or else I probably wouldâ€™ve killed myslef already, and according to this BMI chart Iâ€™m fine, but still. Iâ€™m gonna try to lose weight anyway tho so itâ€™s fine. Thx for reading my rant
