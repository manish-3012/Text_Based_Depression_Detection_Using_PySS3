I have reach the point in NNN where it is not hard anymore, just boring On the first day it's easy, after 7 day NNN become hard but after 14 days, it's just boring, like my body have accepted the fact that I'm not beating my meat, like, I'm just sitting on my bed and I'm like "wow I could be watching porn right now" it's isn't fun anymore after 14 days my brain have completely accepted the NNN and so, it isn't hard anymore, just boring


(Btw, how your NNN is going ?)
