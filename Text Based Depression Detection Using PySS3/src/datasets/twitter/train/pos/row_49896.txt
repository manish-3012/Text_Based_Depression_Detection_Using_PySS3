dark humor is about making fun of your own personal struggles not somebody elseâ€™s. r/unpopularopinion wouldnâ€™t let me post it so here it is.

pretty much title, as of recently iâ€™ve seen an influx of â€œdark humorâ€ posts joking about serious topics and issues such as rape, racism, homophobia, and sexism. these jokes tend to be really insensitive to victims of these acts. typically the person behind the jokes havenâ€™t been on the other end of these issues and it shows. i am aware that you a majority of the time you canâ€™t tell when itâ€™s people on the internet but in general itâ€™s not funny when you use **someone elseâ€™s** struggles and hardships at the expense of a dumb joke. you canâ€™t just make a joke about someoneâ€™s death and then say â€œitâ€™s dark humor youâ€™re too sensitiveâ€.
