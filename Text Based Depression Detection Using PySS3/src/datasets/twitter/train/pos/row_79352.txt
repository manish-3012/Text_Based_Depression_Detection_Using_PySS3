Itâ€™s 12:30 am rn and Iâ€™m working off a shot of espresso and a four loco but I just came up with the saying â€œyou fight a wildfire before it spreads, not once it reaches the firestationâ€ and Iâ€™m fucking proud of myself I mean Iâ€™m delusional so Iâ€™ll probably see this shit in the morning and be like wow what a horrible fucking sentence and be all sad and shit that wonâ€™t be cool
