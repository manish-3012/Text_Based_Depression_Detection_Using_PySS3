I think I screw it up every time I try to be cool or to fit in a group So today I finished my online classes and I went to a Whatsapp group, and put an audio message saying "Cool, the fuckin' teacher didn't asked for the homework", and then I noticed I sent it on a group where the teacher was. She obviously listened to it, and just said "I hope that audio wasn't meant to be in this group", and that was all. Of course, my friends started laughing and they're probably mocking of me while I'm writing this post. 

The thing is that I've noticed I usually don't send that kind of messages, I was just trying to be "cool" between my classmates (specially the girls I like). I also remember a time when during a game in the schoolyard, I threw a ball in the face of a classmate, and instead of apologizing, I started laughing because my classmates were doing it. I ended up being scolded and a teacher called me a bully. I have other similar anecdotes, and I've noticed that every time I try to be cool or to fit in, I end being a dick. 

So I've been thinking in just stop trying, I don't want to keep like this, I just want to be alone and just having my family as my friends. Being realistic, I'm just a stupid teenager, so I would like some advice please.
