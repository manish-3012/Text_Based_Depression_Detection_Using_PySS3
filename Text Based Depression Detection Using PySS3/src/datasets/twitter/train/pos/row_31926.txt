Since my power is out imma tell you what I did today So i woke up at 6:40 said fuck and then went to school

I did math like normal then French but apparently I have a therapist now so I missed most of french

Then I went to music and watched hunter x hunter instead of doing work had lunch and I finished early so me and one of my friends went to explore the basement and found a golf cart just parked in the basement.

The a fire alarm went off and we sat outside for 2 and a half hours until the busses came
