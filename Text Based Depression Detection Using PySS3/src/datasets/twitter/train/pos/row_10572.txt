A case for taxing the ultrawealthy more If Jeff Bezos stopped making money TODAY, he could just give away enough money to make it so 7.6 MILLION households of 4 people living right above the poverty line didnâ€™t have to lift a finger for a year

And still spend 60 million a year for the rest of his life, assuming he lives well past 100

That means he could buy a new hypercar every week, or a handful of lamborghinis, or just keep living in his house with what he has now and buy 114 tacos a minute, every minute, until well after the world is completely fucked
