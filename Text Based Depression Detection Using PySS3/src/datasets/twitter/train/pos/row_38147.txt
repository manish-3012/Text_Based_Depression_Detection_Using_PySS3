The time I shot a rabbit and cooked it to spite my sister So my sister is a vegetarian going vegan and well I have to accommodate to my sister when I cook dinner, so one night she cooks dinner and refuses to let me have any. So it was rabbit season so i went outside and shot one. Well this pissed her off, but that didn't matter because I skinned the rabbit and cooked on a spit outside and she wouldn't let me go back inside to get some barbecue sauce for it. Still my greatest accomplishment yet
