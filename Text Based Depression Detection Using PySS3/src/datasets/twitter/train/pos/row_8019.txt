do you ever feel even a bit pretty but you receive some sense of false security by self degrading and intentionally dressing poorly in school because for too long you have acted â€œweirdâ€ and you canâ€™t just change that even though itâ€™s your dying wish and you really want to move schools or even countries because no family lives where you live and you feel like you have nothing and you have no pursuable talent whatsoever and everything you do you are mildly good at and you havenâ€™t continued anything since your early childhood because you just give up everything and you have no friends to go out with even though you have friends they arenâ€™t close and you feel like you need to have a good social image everywhere you go and you need to be friends with everyone but also strive for conflict but not the type which gets everyone to hate you which is selfish kind of and you donâ€™t know why you have nothing to do when youâ€™re not even a bad person or something 

and you canâ€™t forget how different you act around different people, hehe which is why you hardly ever want to mix up any different friend groups and the 2 only like good friends you have just arenâ€™t enough for you and you donâ€™t know why AND YOU JUST KIND OF WANT EVERYTHING BUT YOU CANT HAVE EVERYTHING CAN YOU and you desire for either one bsf you can trust with your life who enjoys being around u or a group of 4 or more people where you treat everyone like equals but also respect secrets and privacy and you realise itâ€™s IMPOSSIBLE at least for now and you just require a really big change in life and you actually have enough free time to write all of this

also have you ever noticed that if you look into a window at night you look good lol but youâ€™ll never catch a picture of that 

TLDR: bruh just read it for my sake ok
