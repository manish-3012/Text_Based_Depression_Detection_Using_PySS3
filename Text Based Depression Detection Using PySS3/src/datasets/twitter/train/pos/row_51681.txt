Writing something positive about my day, day #291 (quarantined on my own day #1) Honest, so far Iâ€™m kinda liking being quarantined. Iâ€™m lucky in that I got to do it in a nice hotel and yeah. All the clothes I like have been packed for like a month before I actually traveled so itâ€™s nice being able to wear what I want to again. Iâ€™ve only got a couple class on Saturday so itâ€™s been a pretty chill day. 

The reason Iâ€™m being quarantined is because I traveled from another country so I can attend the boarding school Iâ€™m going to. Itâ€™s for two weeks and Iâ€™m on my own because my parents couldnâ€™t come with me.
