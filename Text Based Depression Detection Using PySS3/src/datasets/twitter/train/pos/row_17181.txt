Any tips for beginners of soccer/football? (TL:DT : new to football, how do you stop the fear of getting hurt while playing) So, my new school has those sport centered PE lessons that we could choose at the begging of the year. I could pick Nordic walking, cycling, fitness or football and my weird brain thought "hmm, I've never played football, let's give it a try!" and now I'm the worst player that literally can't do anything! I'm also the only girl there and all the other boys are bigger and stronger then me :(. We had our first lesson last Tuesday and I'm so scared of getting hurt because others kick the ball really hard! I'm not a really sporty person and my stamina is pretty low, is it even worthy for me to play when a lot of players have played their whole life?
