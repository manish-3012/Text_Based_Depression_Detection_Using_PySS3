I hate my jacket sometimes My leggings are going down a little but I canâ€™t pull them up because my jacket goes down to my knees and Iâ€™d have to pull my jacket up which is weird. My skirt is also partly unzipped but I canâ€™t zip it until I donâ€™t have my jacket on but I need my jacket on until I get to school ):&lt;
