Guys I don't know what to do now I got into an argument with my dad a few days ago, and we have been ignoring each other ever since. Today it escalated into him taking away my new laptop, and he even tried to take my 3d printer, but my mom stopped him. Then we started shouting at each other, and my mom said she wanted to fix the family and whatever. Cut to now, and my mom is in my room silently sobbing while I'm in my sister's room using her laptop. As for my dad, who the fuck cares? Definitely not me anymore. Guys I honestly don't know what to do. And please understand that my dad is a real prick, and he was the one who started the argument anyways, so don't tell me to apologize to him, because I won't.
