Hey guys,Please get your shit together. You are not the only one depressed,You are the only person that thinks they are ugly,You are not the only person that doesnt have good parents,You are not the only person that doesnt have the courage to ask someone out,You are not the only introvert.
There are hundreds of millions like you,you are not alone,
You cant get a girl if you just sit in the corner of class like a lazy ass,Say nothing,Admire someone secretly and just hope that they like you back.
Get your shit together and talk,Flirt,Dance and have fun,If you dont get the girl some other dick will,
Sorry if this post is a bit harsh,But its just the reality,No girl will ever like you if you dont flirt.
Everyone has problems,Millions of people have the exact problems as you,Ranting doesnt work,So please get out there and socialize,
Whats the worst thing she can say?Eww?
Cmon man,Have some self respect for yourself,You only live once.
