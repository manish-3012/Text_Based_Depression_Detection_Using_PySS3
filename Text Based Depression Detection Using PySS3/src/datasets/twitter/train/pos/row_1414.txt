Online school. Online school is ridiculous I really hate it I won't lie. I think school has become so much harder and teachers just keep putting out work, work, work. And any questions take a day or more to get answered. As someone who asks tones of questions this has been killing my grades. 

Sadly nothing we can do so I send out love and hope to all who are having the same issues.
