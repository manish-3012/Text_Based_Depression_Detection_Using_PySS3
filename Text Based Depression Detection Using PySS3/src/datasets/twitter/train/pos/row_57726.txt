I really want to see my friend again. I met one of the best people I have ever met a few years ago and she and I had long conversations and we listened to music and stayed up late and fell asleep on calls together. Then she - well lets just say she can never come back from where she is. Lately, I've been thinking of inducing hallucinatory psychosis or some kind of schizophrenia just to hear her laugh or see her smile one more time. I really, really miss her. Every time I see something she might like, I think, "Oh I should send this to her," and then remember I can't. Or every time something bad happens and I need to talk to someone I realize I can't. And that's the worst feeling in the world. Knowing you've probably lost a person forever. Knowing you can never experience them ever again.
