If elected president I would do a lot of things...what about you? Reform education systems to include less biased common core, completely reform ICE, CPS, and the police, make a law requiring more than bipartisan representatives in all forms of government that have party representatives. Make marijuana legal, and pardon everyone arrested for possession. Make it illegal for hospitals to charge more than double the coat of any procedure or for any tools/medicine required. Raise taxes on anyone who makes enough
 that they don't have to pay social security, and then abolish aforementioned law about making enough that you don't have to pay social security. Create a program that would rebuild and clean up low income neighborhoods by employing and teaching the homeless, unemployed, and people who live in same neighborhoods. Therefore giving them a chance to get work experience, learn a trade, and get paid to do something desperately needed. Abolish the internet company monopoly and make a prisoner bill of rightsz requiring reform rather than punishment. That's all I can think of right now.
