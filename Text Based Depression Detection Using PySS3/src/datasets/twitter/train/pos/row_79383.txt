How to get your shit together? I'm 17 years old boy, I have never cared much about the way i look but I realised that this is great time to change myself. Don't get me wrong, my hygiene was always flawless all the time , but my hair is weird and I have acne (currently taking accutane). I'm pretty tall, but I'm kinda skinny even though I don't feel like that. Only physical activity I have is biking once a week, or once in two weeks (I would bike more but I'm renting bike). Also I have no idea about male routine so any products that I can get in Europe are welcomed.
