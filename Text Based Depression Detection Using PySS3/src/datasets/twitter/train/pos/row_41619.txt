I am mad at Minecraft So, maybe an hour ago I died 1,000 blocks away in a pig bastion. One of the brutes knocked me in lace when I thought I was safe. It took me the whole hour to get back. I died maybe 10 times and used up all of my extra food(4 stacks of potatoâ€™s). When I finally get there I fight off 3 brutes and when I checked where I died all of my stuff despawned. I wasnâ€™t even in the chunks for that long. I was looking for it and a magma cube along gang bangs me with a brute and I die. 

I had full netherite gear that was pretty much maxed out. A maxed crossbow and all of the netherite tools. 

I am taking aBreak from Minecraft
