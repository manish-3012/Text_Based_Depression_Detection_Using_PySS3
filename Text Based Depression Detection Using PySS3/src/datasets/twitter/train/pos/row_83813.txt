I love my cat, Pickle, but I hate him He's so cute and usually sweet but he's a kitten. So he doesn't sleep a lot. He goes through my trash can and gets his head stuck in potato chip bags. I make earrings so I have a small container of jump rings on my desk. They're different colors and I have around over 400. HE KNOCKED THEM OVER. I had to separate them the best I could but oh my god I thought I was gonna lose it. He ran directly into my window and lost a tooth. He got inside my geckos tank. He literally broke the lid and got inside. I grabbed him before he could do anything else but now I have to buy a new lid. He chews on the tuning pegs of my bass and he scratched my tiddy when I wore a low cut shirt. It's like if he isn't head butting something he's attacking me. He literally pooped in my brothers box spring two days after we got him. The only thing that keeps him occupied is bubbles. I still love him tho
