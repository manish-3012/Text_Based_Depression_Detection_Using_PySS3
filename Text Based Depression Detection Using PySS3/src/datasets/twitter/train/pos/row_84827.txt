iâ€™m just done living iâ€™m dirt fucking broke, i canâ€™t even afford a fucking coffee, and iâ€™m just being used like a fucking slave by my parents. my mom constantly has me do shit for her, and when itâ€™s time to pay me, she doesnâ€™t have the money, and sheâ€™ll pay me later. next thing i know, she did something for me so she doesnâ€™t have to pay me. i donâ€™t even have a fucking dollar to my name, and my only fucking friends i donâ€™t even talk to anymore.  i donâ€™t even deserve them. all i do is complain to them, and they have to try to make me feel better. itâ€™s all just lies, and iâ€™m sick of it. i live off my parents, and with all the shit they deal with iâ€™m just another nuisance that they have to take care of. i couldnâ€™t save five dollars to save my goddamn life, if i see something i want i buy it, and then all my moneys gone, and a subscription comes up and i canâ€™t afford it, so my parents pay for it, and i just owe them even more money than i already do. hell, if i sold my soul iâ€™d still owe money, and i even owe money to my friends, they donâ€™t even need to deal with me and they still waste their money on a dead man, all i do is sit in my room and waste my life. i might as well be dead. people would be better off without a leech on them. thanks for reading my rant for whatever reason.
