Human decorate what we think is special Me and my brother were talking about ancient people and he mentioned some people with undecorated spears saying that they donâ€™t find war important which was claimed by some Mesopotamia people idk which he is the history nerd but we as human beings decorate what be believed is important. Cars are painted and Air Force pilots paint their blue planes sometimes. Some people had pretty cases for phones or put stickers on laptops. We get tattoos and piercings and we make many types of art. Creativity isnâ€™t a virtue itâ€™s a way we as human embed our souls onto something. I just came to that realization and you can argue if you disagree or whatever if one person read this I am happy. I felt like I needed to share this and all the people I would share something like this to is asleep. Creation is the humans imprint on the world.
