I often feel like I want to be alone? I know I've got friends whom I can count on to talk about things whenever I'm feeling down and they also include me into their plans which I am thankful for but here I am lying on bed, alone with my intrusive thoughts and would rather be alone than to interact with people

Idk man I just feel drained all the time and it's not like I am intentionally pushing everyone away. I feel so fucking bad whenever I'm in one of these moods again (which seems to be a never-ending cycle).
