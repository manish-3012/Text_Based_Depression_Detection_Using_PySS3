Girl that rejected me got mad because I said I wasnt hitting on her and also because I said we could never be friends like we used to. What should I do ? this girl got mad for what i said in the title.

some things happened which led to her thinking i was hitting on her. I only invited her to go out to eat (like in the past) but I meant as a group but I didnt think to mention that last part.

i made it clear that I wasn't hitting on her. I said exactly "I still like you, but I'm not hitting on you. I understand what is between you and me"


 I also said that i wanted to be friends like we used to but for obvious reasons we would never be able to be friends like that (before the rejection).

back then, we talked way more (everyday, frequently until 4am ) and everything was natural. she always knew I liked her but she had never rejected me.

we used to always go out to eat as a group but we planned to go just us two, but covid canceled that "date".

ever since the rejection, things haven't been like that.

my gut tells me its because she used to like me back then but then something happened which led to her rejecting me. (She didn't meet another guy. I think she got scared of commitment OR she was just playing with my feelings)

and so now, she truly only sees me as a friend.

but she told me that even back then I was just a friend, her attituded towards says the complete opposite tho.

so anyway, she got mad, i never apologized (still don't plan to). i tried talking in the beginning but she ignored me.

its been 3 weeks so far and we haven't talked at all.

i will see her tuesday and i don't know what I should do.

Should i follow her lead and mirror the way she acts with me.

if she ignored me, I ignore her, etc...

or should i try to talk to her and act as if her getting mad never happened, and see how she reacts ?

Ps: 3 weeks since she got mad for what I said. It's been about 5 months since the rejection. And we got close for 4+ months before the rejection
