Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 22 Darn, I missed yesterday too!! However, that was because I was occupied with something amazing. I visited the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama! I took lots of pictures, so if you wanna see those lemme know! I'll post today's fact this evening, but for now, here's yesterday's!

Fact: Pluto is not the only dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit! There are actually 3 other main ones, and they're all super cool! Maybe not as cool as Pluto, though ;). Their names are Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. I guess you could consider this 3 facts in one, cause imma tell you some info about each one of these little guys!

Haumea actually looks like an egg! We've never sent any missions there, but based on observations from Earth, we can tell that Haumea spins VERY fast. As a result, it has an oval shape!

Makemake might have an atmosphere! Based on information gathered about the dwarf planet, researchers have concluded that there's a possibility that a thin nitrogen atmosphere could exist. This would make Makemake the only dwarf planet with an atmosphere!

Eris is actually the reason why Pluto is no longer a planet! Upon its discovery in 2003, it was originally thought that Eris was slightly larger than Pluto, prompting the International Astronomical Union to reconsider what a planet really is. For the time being, Eris was kinda-sorta a planet. Eventually, after the discoveries of Haumea and Makemake in the years following, the IAU unfortunately demoted Pluto and all of his friends in 2006.
