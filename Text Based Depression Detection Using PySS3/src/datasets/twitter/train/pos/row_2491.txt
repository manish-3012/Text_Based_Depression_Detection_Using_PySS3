A homie need some input Okay, I (17m) have this coworker (15f) who I think likes me. That's all fine and dandy, but there are a couple things I'm not sure about.

1: there is a 2.5 year age difference and idk if that is pushing it or not. (I turn 18 in a couple weeks and she turns 16 in January).

2: she is my friends sister

3: I am going to college in a couple weeks. Not super far though, just a 2 hour drive

I think it could work out, but the main thing I'm concerned about is the age difference. Her and I talk alot at work everyday and we are getting pretty close, and all our coworkers said that she is flirting with me (the whole time I thought she was being friendly). And I do kind of wanna go for it because other coworkers of mine got together when they were 23 and 17, and they say that she seems like she is into me. What do you guys think? All input is appreciated :)

Disclaimer: if we did get together I would keep that shit nonsexual until it's 100% legal
