How to not come across as creepy Essentially Iâ€™m on break and Iâ€™m trying to meet girls, (maybe get lucky and even hold hands ðŸ˜¶) but i donâ€™t know how to approach them without coming across as a weird dude coming to talk to them. Do yâ€™all have any advice? What to start a conversation about? or other tips, anythingâ€™s appreciated.
