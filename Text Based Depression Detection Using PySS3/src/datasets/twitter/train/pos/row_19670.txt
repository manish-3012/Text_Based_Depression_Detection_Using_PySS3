Just because you're a relative doesn't mean you get work for free Don't ya'll just hate it when someone uses "I'm your relative, you should just give it to me for free" excuses?

Like yo I worked hard on this. I spent my time doing this when I could've been playing games and relaxing instead. Don't you dare use that 'relative card' 'I'm Family card' on me. Work is work. So pay up.
