Anxiety before You do something that is good for you, (for me, it's writing and studying)  

Do you like face with random fits of anxiety before starting to do something?

I swear, every day, before I write I just feel anxious. It's the same before studying or anything productive. I don't know the reason why I feel anxious but it happens.   
If anyone does know, do you people know the ways you got around it?
