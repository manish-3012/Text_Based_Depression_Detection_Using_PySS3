Starting a business, which is very hard because everything is setup against teens or kids. You canâ€™t get a buisness license until your 18, many people wonâ€™t hire you because your too young. You donâ€™t have the money to get education, and without those diplomas many people wonâ€™t hire you. Itâ€™s so annoying because your teen years are the best years to try new stuff like making your own company.

Also I do have a side gig. Go to my website at Leonidyankop.webflow.io and you can get a professional logo for yourself for only 25$
