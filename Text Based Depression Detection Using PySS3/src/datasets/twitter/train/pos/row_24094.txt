Yo like try to drink water and stuff. I'm guessing we've all seen the thing about drinking water when stressed but I mostly didnt think much about or thought it was a joke but it actually seems to help. I began telling my friends to drink water when stressed and reminding them to eat and it seems to be effective. Remember that if you are trying to help someone or need help. If you haven't eaten try eating something light I'd suggest plain cheerios cause they are easy on the stomach and dont have a strong taste so you can eat them without an appetite. If you haven't gone to sleep yet try taking some sleep aid a nice rest will probably help.
