Relationship advice Me (15m) has a giant crush on my friends old ex.
Ok so my friend dated this girl (16f) and they broke up a while ago probably like early 2020 and I still talk to her quite a bit because we're friends and I've gotten pretty close to her do you guys think it's okay to ask her out even though it's my best friend's ex.
