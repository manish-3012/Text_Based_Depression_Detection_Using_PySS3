Maybe, but I need more of them, I have Thomas ( the th is not silent itâ€™s THH-OMAS btw ) and pinky, a plant dedicated to an anime character that drinks more water then I do, I need more plants, or to talk to people idk, my friends arnt responding to me lmao Iâ€™ve been left on r e a d  and they have there own friend groups besides one introverted book worm that dosnt need people and a skater girl that shaved her head, pretty sure sheâ€™s doing weed, breaks her bones constantly, and then thereâ€™s me, anyways, time to go sped 70$
