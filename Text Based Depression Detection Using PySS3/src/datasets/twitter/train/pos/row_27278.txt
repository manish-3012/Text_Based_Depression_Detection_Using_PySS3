You ever look at your life..... And realize that you have never made a decision for yourself and always when along with what other people where doing and now you donâ€™t know a single thing about your self because you always just copied everyone around you, and always went with the bigger group so now you donâ€™t even know if you like the people you call friends but youâ€™re to much of a coward to do anything about it. So now youâ€™re just a suicidal mix of different people hulking around changing personality to be more agreeable with the person you are talking to and you donâ€™t know what your actual personality is, and then because of that you are now a pathological liar you canâ€™t have a basics conversation with lieimg through your teeth. No just me, ok
