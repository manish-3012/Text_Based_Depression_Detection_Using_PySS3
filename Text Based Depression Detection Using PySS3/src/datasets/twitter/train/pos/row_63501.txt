Wish people would mind their own business. This "friend" of mine told me the other day that I shouldn't make posts about other people without their permission. See, lately I've been making posts about this girl who had been fucking with me a lot in various ways. On my main account, not this one. 

Anyway, this "friend" threatened me and said she'd ruin my reputation to the girl who I had been talking about in the posts if I didn't stop. I didn't argue with her cause I was already having problems with the girl from the posts that night and really wasn't in the mood. 

This girl constantly gets in others' business and it's frustrating. She's done this to me before with a different girl in the past, it seems like she almost feels like she needs to keep me "in check" or something.
