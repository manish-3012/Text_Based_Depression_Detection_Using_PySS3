Bit ugly innit Alr so recently posted shrek on r/hotguys and all and got banned but now I can't stop getting recommended. My brother picked up my phone today and looked at my notifications (the nosey nonce) and saw one of the notifications of a guy in the shower. He put down my phone and had a big talk about how that was bad and whatever and didn't listen to me  keep in mind he is older than me by about 2 yrs (he's 17) and im gonna freak, I bet he thinks I'm a wierd bitch that gets off to 56 men in the shower. Pray for me.
