I have this fear in the back of my mind that I'm always being made fun of by the kids i don't know as well. Sometimes I feel like that they take me seriously and don't understand that I'm pretty much joking all the time. I also have a feeling they're making fun of me when they play along with some of the jokes I make. Idk it might just be late night thoughts
