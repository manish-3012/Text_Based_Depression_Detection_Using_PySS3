MC account got hammered D: Hello there my fellow teenagers! I was trying to get on my minecraft account so I could get onto the teenagers minecraft server, but guess what? My account was breached! FUCKK. I think I have the situation under control now, but god damn i'm pissed. I've already send an email to Mojang about it, I hope that I can get my name restored (can't change name until 9/8, first day of school).

Was just here to vent.
