Day 2 of avoiding the song All I want for Christmas So for the most part I did well didn't see any mentions of the song. However there was a post on perfectly cut screams that i almost clicked on, luckily I had seen it before and successfully managed to avoid pressing unmute. That's all for today's progress report. Will update you all at the end of tomorrow.
