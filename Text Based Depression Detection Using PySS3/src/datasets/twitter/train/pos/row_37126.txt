I told my dad I was suicidal and he told me itâ€™s all my fault and the world doesnâ€™t revolve around me. Yeah dad THIS IS MY FAULT I guess beating me and my siblings at least once a week just because you can is my fault? I guess barely eating anything all day cause you just sit in your room all day with all your retirement money is my fault? I guess separating with my mom when I was 9 and starting a war with the family is my fault? I guess working me constantly until I canâ€™t stand up is my fault? Constantly going to god knows where and leaving me alone in the house for days at a time is my fault? Yeah this is totally my fault.

I might kill myself just so he can see what heâ€™s done to me and my mom and siblings. Iâ€™m done with this shit.
