Never eating caffeine again My sleep schedule was ruined from school so I wanted to fix this. To stay awake, I opened a capsule of a 200mg caffine pill. I then tried to act like a scientist to put it in a test tube followed by boiling water. I wasnâ€™t aware the test tube was cracked and it exploded for some reason, so there was glass and caffeine juice everywhere. I vomited on it all as well. I honestly didnâ€™t give a shit and tossed a pillow on the mess and blamed it on the dog. I read online that drain cleaner breaks down pretty much everything (even glass) so I poured a 1l bottle of draino on everything. To my suprise, the pillow transformed into a black steaming pile of death and at that point i just poured water, bleach, and soap on it and covered that with a thomas the tank engine towel from when I was a kid. The smell was so unbearable I emptied a whole can of febreez laundry spray  and called it a day. Fuck you caffeine!!!!
