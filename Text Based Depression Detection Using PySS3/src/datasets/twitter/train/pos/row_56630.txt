Iâ€™m really sad I spent the past two days learning/performing basic video editing so that I could have something creative to do. I made this really fun csgo video with 11 minutes of edited footage from a game. It was amazing and after working on it for probably 8-12 or so hours I was able to watch the video with its cuts, music, screen shakes, and zooms. I was proud because it showed how much I had learned all by myself, as well as it being really funny to watch. As soon as I rendered it, the file it got corrupted and the entirety of the raw footage and all my work has been wiped clean of my hard drive for no reason. Feeling like crying rn.
