I canâ€™t stop thinking about this girl in my cross country team. I know Iâ€™m not in her league but I canâ€™t help it I think sheâ€™s attractive, respectable, and sheâ€™s a hard working runner even if sheâ€™s not the best. 

I know I donâ€™t have a chance with her, hell idek if sheâ€™s single or not. This is basically every crush I have 

Time to get over this one and find another
