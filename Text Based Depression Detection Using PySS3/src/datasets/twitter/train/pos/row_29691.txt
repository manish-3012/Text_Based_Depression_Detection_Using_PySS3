TIL something valuable and Iâ€™ll remember it my whole life. Me and my friends where making fun of this girl that was in our class when I went to high school(In our WhatsApp group that she is not in ) cuz she got a skrilex type hair cut, then she uploaded an Instagram story saying that she was so happy with her hair cut, and that she was sad, but now she feels confident and I honestly just feel like a shity person. If she is happy, then fuck me and what I think about her hair cut.
