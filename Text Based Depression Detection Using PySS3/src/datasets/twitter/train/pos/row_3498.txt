How to lose weight... Hi there, I just want to be less fat than I already am, I'm getting tired getting fat shaming by my parents (yea, you heard that right) they getting sick of need to buy more bigger size school uniform every year. They said I'm a fat piece of shit (sort of but not exactly like that but with sarcasm that I probably thought was an insult). So can someone give me some tips. Btw I'm a man soooo yeah.
