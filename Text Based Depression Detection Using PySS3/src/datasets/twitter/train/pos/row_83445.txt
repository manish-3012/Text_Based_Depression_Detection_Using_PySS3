what the fuck happened to two-touch you had a wall, you had two touches to kick a ball into the wall, 2 player game, if the ball misses the wall or you use more than 2 touches you're out. one-touch was a variation.

did nobody fucking play this game outside of my area and apparently a small town in australia? most my damn rural elementary school played that shit and the kids at my school played it too, what the fuck happened to it? i was asking some friends from other states and they had no clue what it was
