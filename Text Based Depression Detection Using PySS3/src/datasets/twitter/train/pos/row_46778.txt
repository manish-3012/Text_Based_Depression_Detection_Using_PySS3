Any basketball players here? I need advice/help. I am a 10th grade student looking forward to make my high schoolâ€™s basketball team when I am in grade 11. I have no experience being with a sports team and I am really bad at basketball. I canâ€™t shoot, pass, make smart decisions on the court, I canâ€™t dribble, my footwork is terrible, and I miss most of my layups. According to my friends, my best part is defence. Another thing I add is that Iâ€™m short and overweight (4â€™10â€ 130LBS). I would really appreciate it if I could get some advice on how to get a bit taller and improve my basketball game.
