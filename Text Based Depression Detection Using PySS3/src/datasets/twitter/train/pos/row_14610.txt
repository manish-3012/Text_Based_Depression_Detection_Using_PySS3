My parents hate me I am in grade 10 and i have school for 3 hours, tuitions for 3 hours and I study for 2 hours. They say its not enough and often yell at me and insult me. This not all, after all this, I use Discord and play games for an hour or something, they get triggered. They do not value me and make me feel  I am worthless. They never appreciate any artworks I do and say I need to study. What should I do?
