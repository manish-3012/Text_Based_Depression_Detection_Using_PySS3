Pray for Lebanon So many probably know what the Lebanon explosion, but Can people please stop saying â€œthoughts and prayersâ€  I get that people are trying to do good but most of the people saying that donâ€™t even mean it, 
my aunt was almost killed in the las Vegas shooting and if she was and people would just say that without actually trying to help Iâ€™d be so angry, I donâ€™t know if anyone else feels like this but people just say it constantly without even meaning it and for me itâ€™s so disrespectful
