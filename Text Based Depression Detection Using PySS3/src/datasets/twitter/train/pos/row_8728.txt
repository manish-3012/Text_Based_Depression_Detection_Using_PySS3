iâ€™m a terrible person but i feel at peace with that i know i say bad things to people. at the end of the day, itâ€™s not going to affect me, and Iâ€™ll still be alone and by myself. 

i just donâ€™t really care honestly. i donâ€™t want to talk to anyone. iâ€™m fine on my own, but donâ€™t know why i feel so content with it
