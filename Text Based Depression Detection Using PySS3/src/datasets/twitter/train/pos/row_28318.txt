It's weird having olive skin in the UK during Summer Like you're still white, but you're surrounded by all of these white people who are pink and red because their fair skin is burned and you're this weird yellow/bronze colour. Then you have your family complaining, aching with sunburn and you're like "That's what you get for being white"
