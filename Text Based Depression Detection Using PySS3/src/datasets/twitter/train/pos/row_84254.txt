I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do with my life or what career path Iâ€™m going to take. Iâ€™m a really social person and I love the outdoors such as hunting, fishing, and I like trucks. What do yâ€™all think would be a good career for me? I donâ€™t care about making a lot of money I just want a career that would be able to support me and my family that I would enjoy.
