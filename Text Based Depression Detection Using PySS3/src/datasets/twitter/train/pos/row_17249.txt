[Serious] Hi guys! I am a 30F and I am extremely worried about my nieces eating disorder and possible links to social media trends? Hey- I know some of this subs is just memes and shit posts but it always makes me smile to get an eye into your culture. It seems my niece (14F) has turned down a shit path of anorexia (which I dealt with as a younger girl, so I know it is very real). Iâ€™m just wondering if the there is a current trend going on on Tiktok or Insta (aside from the OBVIOUS illogical body shaming posed as beauty based off filters and photoshop etc). Is there a current trend thatâ€™s happening with having a low BMI or having the lowest weight being â€œcoolâ€ or is she actually uniquely just mentally unwell? I know she has a problem no matter what I just want to know if this is a new â€œthingâ€ in your generation... thanks for any responses (and links to sources if this exists) and please take care of yourselves!! Youâ€™re all beautiful!
