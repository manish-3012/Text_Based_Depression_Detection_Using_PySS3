It's clear he doesn't want me but I can't stop thinking about him. Before I start, this isn't a crush. It was at one point, but it's not anymore. He is gay and I am bisexual. 


It's pretty clear that he doesn't like me like that. I kind of casually expressed interest about 3 months ago and he knew what I meant, and nothings happened. We're really good friends, but I'm starting to collapse a little bit. I'm starting to spiral and it's reignited depression and self esteem issues I had under control. I spend a lot of times just imagining situations where we're together so I can be happy for a little while. He's not with anybody, but I hurt anyways. I've tried to move on but this isn't as simple as the other times.
