I don't want this Any of it. Life, whatever, I want it to end.

Everything is worthless. I am worthless, so worthless..

There is no point in being happy, gaining happiness  wouldn't help at all.

Why can't I just have a gun, I don't want to fail again and it has a higher success rate.

It doesn't make any sense, emotions. I don't understand it, why would being happy change anything

What even is happy? What is it like?

No matter anyway, I won't have a chance to feel it. That's just the way things are.

Why can't I just leave, why do people care about it, it is pointlesss to care about whether or not someone so lowly as me is alive.

I never asked for this, any of it.
