Y'all ever... Y'all ever just end up going way to fast and far with someone online in one day and the next they seem to start ghosting you like damn they didn't even get the last two promised pics before seeming to drop off the face of the earth. Hell I shaved down there for the last two pics for them (well I was going to soon anyways but still)
