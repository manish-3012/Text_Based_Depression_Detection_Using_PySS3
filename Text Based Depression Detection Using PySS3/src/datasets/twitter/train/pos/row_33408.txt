I wanna start a zoo of really weird individual animals animals that you won't get to see in any other zoo or wildlife preserve

I'm thinking of having a whole ornithological building where we feed birds mutating agents and you can look at their mutated chicks as they hatch

We'll accept donations from local science labs for any abnormal animals that come about after experimentation

we'll surgically graft polar bear fur to a gorilla to give you an idea of what a yeti might look like
