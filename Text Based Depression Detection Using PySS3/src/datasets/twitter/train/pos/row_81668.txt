I stopped an electrical fire Ok so basically I was laying in bed about to fall asleep when I hear a loud pop. I look around and see the corner of my room on fire. I jumped out of bed and waited for the breaker to trip that was it would be safe. I know that if there is no power you can use water which is what I did. I single handedly saved my house, and family, from a fire. I checked the outlet by opening it and it was all okay, but I am still scared. The outlet is charred, my chromebook for school doesn't work, but my house and family lived.
