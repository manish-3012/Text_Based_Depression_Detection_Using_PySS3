Iâ€™m searching for that good sort of ice cube Iâ€™m an ice cube eating addict in the UK, and Iâ€™m trying to search for those small, crunchy sort of ice cubes by the bag (the sort you can get in Nandos, and from online research a place called â€˜Sonicâ€™ in the States).

I canâ€™t seem to find it anywhere other than the machine to make it.
Anyone have any idea where I could purchase some?
Itâ€™s known as Nugget/Chewable/Pebble/Pearl ice.

My mum says I can dedicate a drawer of our new freezer to ice cubes and I just want to get the sort I like .

Thanks in advance !
