I SAW A POST ABOUT THIS AND NOW IT ALL CAME BACK AND I NEED TO VENT So the post was about something that you don't get mad when people do it to u but get mad at yourself if you do it to someone.

I don't really care if someone invites me to a birthday party/ event or not, if they're my friends they're my friends a stupid party doesn't change that.

Well, the problem is when I am the one who doesn't invite someone...

So basically what happened was I didn't invite two of my friends to my birthday because there would be too many people ( like 10 people is too many for me- blame anxiety) so because they didn't invite me that year I didn't invite them either. I thought that was fair. But when they found out and asked me I had to tell them in their face they were not invited and I felt so fucking bad. It's been almost a year and I still feel bad. This year they also didn't invite me but that's ok I deserved it but now idk what I'm gonna do because i don't really want to celebrate and with covid it would actually be too many people, but I have this feeling that I owe it to them cause I let them down and I feel so fucking bad. The worse thing is they were part of this friend group where they were really close and I was the new guy but this past year they've grown so apart, like those 2 and the others just grew apart and I'm pretty sure is my fault because it started after I didn't invite them.

Sorry for the vent. I just needed to calm down and put my thoughts in written
