Reminder that depression does not necessarily have to mean you're sad all the time It can be just feeling numb to emotions. Like not feeling love, or not being as sad as you should when a loved one dies. Or not feeling happy, but not feeling sad either, just empty.




It's a new year, so if you're feeling bad, now is a great time to start the process of improving! It's never wrong to ask for help with this stuff.
