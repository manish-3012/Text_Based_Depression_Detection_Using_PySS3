Fuck I was supposed to be up at 8 to go some work. But now it's 2am Becuase I was playing civ and lost track of time. He said he'd be out working at 7 but he told me hours are flexible so I told him I'd show around 9 or 10. Should I just get up at 930 to do it or set an alarm for 8 make up an excuse and say I can't work till 11?
