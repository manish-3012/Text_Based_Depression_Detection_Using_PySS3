Please everyone, be smart about being stupid (obv. I am an adult) So my son would be turning 22 today if he had only listened to this. Being drunk and/or on drugs with your friends and ghost riding is fucking stupid. You know it, I know it...fuck he even knew it but it happened anyway. And now hes not here. I know it feels like you all are invincible but please, for the love of all that there is....if you know you are gonna be doing stupid shit, be responsible about it at least so no one gets hurt. I am sure his friends will blame themselves for the rest of their lives...no one needs to live with this. 
Thanks for listening
