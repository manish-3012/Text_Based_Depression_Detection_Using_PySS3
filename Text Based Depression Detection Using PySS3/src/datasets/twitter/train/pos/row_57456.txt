what type of guys/girls are you into? random question but Iâ€™m curious. personally Iâ€™m into countrish boys. the ones that fish, hunt, and drive a truck. thatâ€™s the type of family I come from so thatâ€™s prolly why Iâ€™m into guys like that. idk lemme know what youâ€™re into because again Iâ€™m curious for some reason.
