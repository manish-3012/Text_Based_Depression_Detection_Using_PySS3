How can I let my teachers know how I've been struggling? I've been dealing with depression for a long time and it's really affecting my grades. I was encouraged to message them about it but I'm really not sure what to say. I don't know if I should mention how they might grade my assignments because they all do it differently. I'm nervous about this so any help would be appreciated.
