Iâ€™m struggling Do yâ€™all ever want to talk to a person but when you do you feel like your annoying them or they want nothing to do with you I feel like that now with a girl and it doesnâ€™t help when I go to sleep I think of a old ex who I only miss when Iâ€™m going to sleep so itâ€™s hard to even talk
