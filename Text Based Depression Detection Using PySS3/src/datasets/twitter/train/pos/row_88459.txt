Listening to â€œall I want for Christmas is youâ€ until Christmas ? I wanted to try this challenge 2 years ago.  
Rules are:  
1. listen at least 4 Hours a day â€žAll i want for Christmas is youâ€œ  
2. you canâ€™t listen to any other song  
3. starts at the first of November and lasts until Christmas  
4. Other variations of â€žAll I want for Christmas is youâ€œ is allowed   

Should I give it a try again ? Idk I got mixed feelings about this challenge. You guys wanna join me ?
