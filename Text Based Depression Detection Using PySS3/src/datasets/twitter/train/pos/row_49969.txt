How to cope with pressure of performance Since I was little, I was always achieving the best possible result. Being top of the class in elementary and middle school to get in a good high school en eventually in University. I failed my drivers theory exam and was suprising lots of people and i feel like i let not only them but also myself down. I know it sounds like I should not be such of a bitch but i feel every test the pressure to peform because i donâ€™t know anything else. The expectations of me are very high and feel anxiety before every test.
