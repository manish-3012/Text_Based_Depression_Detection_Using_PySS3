A short story So when my little brother was 9 yrs old our parents got him 800 robux. And then we played this one tycoon game, and him being a dumbass, he decided it would be a good idea to spend almost 750 of it on some game passâ€™s. The next morning our older brother logged him out of his roblox account on his iPad as a joke. Turns out he didnâ€™t know what his password was and lost his account. He was so mad and he kicked my older brothers nut sack out of rage.
