I finally got supportive friends The last 4 years I got friend how only tried to make you look weird, stupid and weak. I needed to think about every thing I did or they would use I against you. They randomly punched each other on the upper arm so I also needed to watch them. Last year I also got a knife on my throat.

Now I have friend how really want the best for me and are really supportive.
