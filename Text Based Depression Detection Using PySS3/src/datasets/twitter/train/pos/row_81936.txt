Does masturbating make you a bad person? #Alright so I have a question Iâ€™d like to ask especially to girls, do you feel disgusted by guys who masturbate? Because I personally think itâ€™s fine but someone said that itâ€™s fucking gross.

*Okay so a bit of context here:*

Today after school me and my friend group went to a diner to pass time because weâ€™re having tuition classes in an hour. So when we were waiting for the food, my friend (a dude) talked about this sex joke a youtuber made, i think that youtuber said something like â€œfirst the knuckle then the whole fistâ€. 

Just in case you didnâ€™t thereâ€™s girls and boys in our friend group. So this other girl, immediately after him finishing the joke, yelled â€œyierrrrâ€ which is like an exclamation of feeling disgusted. Okay I think itâ€™s pretty normal to feel a bit disgusted or shy to talk about sex jokes like that but it was later followed up by this sentence: [in Chinese] â€œbtw Iâ€™m **deeply disgusted by guys who masturbate. Like donâ€™t you think theyâ€™re disgusting**? Do you guys masturbate?â€ And then later she said: â€œI cannot â€˜tahanâ€™ boys who masturbateâ€ (tahan is a Malay word commonly used among Malaysians, which means endure, tolerate)

Now hereâ€™s the thing: I bet 90% of men HAVE masturbated at least once at some point of their life, and that about 50% of men masturbate regularly (I didnâ€™t google these numbers itâ€™s just my assumption).  Thereâ€™s just two types of guys: those who openly discuss about porn and stuff, and those who are shy to talk about it and wouldnâ€™t want anyone to know about it.

Iâ€™m pretty sure my that guy friend masturbates although I have no proof, because he hesitated a bit when that girl asked us if we masturbated, and he kinda defended people who masturbate. But so do I, and probably all of you guys reading this post. So Iâ€™m really curious about you girlsâ€™ thoughts on guys masturbating, do you feel disgusted about it?
