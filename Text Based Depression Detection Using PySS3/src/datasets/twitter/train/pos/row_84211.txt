My mental health is whack bro Like I canâ€™t decide whether Iâ€™m afraid of death or suicidal. Death is like all I think about and I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s healthy but idk lol.

The other day I was listening to music and I asked my sister â€œis it weird that I automatically think that most songs are about suicide?â€

Yeah she was a bit concerned lol. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d actually take my own life tho (fingers crossed). 

(Donâ€™t feel bad for me or anything lol, Iâ€™m just vibing)
