Help! I need to learn math! So since this entire semester was online I just looked up all the answers for my math classes and have a 97 overall in my class. My teacher told us today that we actually need to go to school to take the final exam next week, and I thought we were gonna do it online so I wasnâ€™t stressed. I learned absolutely nothing this semester and I need to learn the full syllabus of 11th grade math before next Monday! I studied the entire first unit today and Iâ€™m super tired but I still donâ€™t remember half of it. Does anyone have advice on remembering how to solve stuff? If I donâ€™t study hard enough Iâ€™m 100% gonna fail the exam and itâ€™s worth 35% of my grade
