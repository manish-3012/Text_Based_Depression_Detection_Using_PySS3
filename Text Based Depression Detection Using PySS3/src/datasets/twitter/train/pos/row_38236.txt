I'm lost Hey guys,
I just wanted to get some advice on some things... I am really depressed these last days. I have no one to talk to, my best "friends" laughed at me when I told them I was sad. They think I'm a loser, which makes me feel like I'm a loser. I can't talk to my parents because I don't have a good communication with them and I have worried them enough. I have no other friends to talk to, I feel alone. I just started college and I am having a hard time making friends...   I don't know what to do, I can't talk to people because I'm an introvert and the closest friends to me insult me and humiliate me at any chance. I don't leave them because I'm afraid that once I leave them I'll be incapable of making new friends. I've been trying to keep a positive attitude... but I just can't do it no more. What the hell am I supposed to do? I don't wanna go any further, but I'll never kill myself or end my life. I just can't guys, I swear. Some advice may help
