Today was my birthday Today I got to play minecraft with 5 friends. Here's how that went

1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.

2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.

3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.

4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.

5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said "when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?" 

6. The same friend called drowns "pickaxe munchkins" and "angry boys" when he got attacked by them.

7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 

8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).

9. I was the 2nd person to find diamonds but the first to mine them (the first was flower pot guy in a village chest), and I got to make the nether portal. So thats cool. I died in the nether tho.

Today was a good day tho.
