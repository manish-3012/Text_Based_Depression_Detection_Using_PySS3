How do I continue to have motivation to study? How do I continue to have motivation?

So on the 3rd of next month I have 2 SAT Subject coming up + BMAT a month after that. I was never the dilligent student but since I started new school year ive been trying to improve my discpline and it's getting better. 

However, ive been depressed very lately about many things: the feeling of being left out of all social circle, the insecurity about my own body, the pressure by my parents, it all adds up and im now too overwhelmed. Instead of getting things done I just rot in my bed the moment I came back from school and browse reddit while telling myself I dont have enough time to study anyway, or that I just wanna take a "break" and the next thing I know it's midnight and im still switching between reddit and youtube

I need to get on track fast but I just can't
