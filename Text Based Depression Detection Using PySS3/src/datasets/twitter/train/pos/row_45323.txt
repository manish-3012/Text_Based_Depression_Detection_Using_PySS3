The story of my life (mostly dumb shit I did from sixth to tenth grade) Iâ€™ve been thinking lately about all of my school years in reflection as Iâ€™m a rising senior this year and am about to leave high school and I can remember all of my weird phases or social or love strategies that all failed miserably. Yeah I used to be really awkward until late my sophomore year and still awkward until early my junior year and really annoying until sophomore year if you couldnâ€™t tell from below.

**Elementary School:**

**K-4:** Yeah I donâ€™t really remember any particular phases in here. Some highlights included kindergarten and first grade at a Catholic school that I shouldnâ€™t have been at and my fourth grade girlfriend. I was the kid who cried and did stupid shit sometimes but not that bad as some others were similar.

**Middle School:**

**5th Grade:** We donâ€™t speak of the fifth grade, it was terrible from start to finish for various reasons at different stages (Iâ€™m an August birthday in a school system with a September 1 cutoff and the first half of the year I was far too young for middle school and the second half I couldnâ€™t wait to get out) and was the reason why sixth to tenth grade went as poorly as they did for me.

**6th Grade:** This year I walked in hating school just like the previous year, but something clicked in mid October and made it all get better, eventually I fell head over heels for this girl who was way outta my league and just kinda chased her from January to March and then said forget it and went my own way. Went back chasing her in May and then quit it when June hit.

**7th Grade:** This was the year I walked in extremely arrogant and pompous. I didnâ€™t wanna deal with the girl from sixth grade again so I basically said â€œIâ€™m a free agentâ€ and â€œgirls come to meâ€ and walked around with shades on. This was the year of Cam Newton so just picture me like 2015 Cam Newton if he was a free agent then. Unfortunately for me, I wasnâ€™t Cam Newton, I was an **IDIOT** who had no real shot of getting any girls (well except that one time a freshman girl DMed me on Instagram in like October and it seemed like she liked me yet I still fucked it all up). My pompous ass ended up getting into a conversation where I basically said to my â€œfriendsâ€ â€œI donâ€™t have a crush, girls can come to ME. They ended up texting me for over an hour asking who my real crush was, and since I didnâ€™t have one, I just gave them the name of a girl who I kinda liked the summer prior. Mind you, this was only five weeks into the school year, so from that point (Columbus Day) to Christmas I was faking having a crush on this girl all while being slightly less arrogant and then falling hard for her ironically at the turn of the year. I ended up following her and all of her friends (who I usually wouldnâ€™t hang out with) all around. I ended up going through a weird â€œI donâ€™t wanna grow upâ€ phase when my 13th birthday was approaching towards the end of the year too so thatâ€™s weird. I also REALLY liked dabbing. I ran the trend into the ground lmao.

**8th Grade:** Similar start to seventh grade but I was â€œteenagerizedâ€ and kinda obsessed with girls, far more cringeworthy than early seventh grade. I even joined show choir in the fall just to follow my crush around (Iâ€™m not kidding). As fall wore on I got more quiet, but in December and January I came roaring back, very annoying once again. Then I decided to sit with the popular kids right as the second half of the year begins and I ditched most of my friends to do this. I thought Iâ€™d be the quirky class clown but I was the annoying doofus. When fidget spinners got popular in the spring that year, you guessed it. I got them. I would put them in my fucking front sweatshirt pocket and it would sag like crazy. My teachers would tell me to put them in my locker and instead Iâ€™d go to my locker and put them in my lunchbox and come back with the lunchbox and then use them later on in class. Then in late May with four weeks of school left I heard what everyone *actually* thought of me. They all thought I was an idiot, and *worse*. Of course, I did barely anything and kept on trying to be cool but albeit less loudly.

**High School**

**Freshman Year:** This was the year I was gonna â€œmake changesâ€. Instead, I just got gradually less annoying as the school year went on and barely said anything beyond a few sentences. This is the â€œtoo hotâ€ version of Goldie Locks. My Instagram posts were literally just emojis sometimes because I didnâ€™t wanna seem like eighth grade me. Yeah I tried to be someone I wasnâ€™t again. It may seem like I wasnâ€™t as annoying and quiet freshman year, but donâ€™t be confused, from our first day in late August to Christmas Break I was similar to eighth grade but toned down. I would do those stupid NBA 2K drafts on my chromebook in Health class when I should have been working for example. Then I stopped saying much aside from a few times where Iâ€™d break out these one liners and everyone would laugh. January-April I was relatively quiet but I had some moments of complete and utter stupidity. Then in early May my grandma died, and people started being nicer to me and once I was feeling a little better I came outta my shell and turned into a more well rounded version of eighth grade me. But donâ€™t be confused because I remember playing Africa by Toto at full blast on my chromebook in class during the second to last week of school.

**Sophomore Year:** This year started unlike unlike pretty much all of the years before it (all 11 from Preschool on) replace annoying with awkward. This is the â€œtoo coldâ€ version of Goldie Locks. People stopped being nice to me when we returned late that August and I immediately became reclusive and isolated, unlike ever before. I wouldnâ€™t speak to pretty much anyone at lunch, I would always overthink and read any expression as negative, I was very paranoid and really unhappy. I would sound off on Snapchat stories and blame others for my problems. The only times I spoke Iâ€™d be really socially awkward (well minus this one week I didnâ€™t give a shit in October but even that had its moments, kinda a return to late freshman year in a way). I had really unhealthy coping habits and self loathed quite a bit. This lasted the entire fall and began to go away in January. February was basically my brain switching between extreme highs and lows until I became stable in mid March (after realizing that I was the cause of my problems). The final three months of the year were among the best of high school. I was more in the loop, very social, very active, and really happy. People began to notice and I got more friends, lots more friends.

**Junior Year:** Last year I walked in with a fear of fall (the season) of sorts after the previous fall. I had kept to myself most of the summer as I always had and as a result regressed a bit. I had to get close with some new friends and really â€œfind myselfâ€. This is the â€œjust rightâ€ version of Goldie Locks. September was kinda trash but October was the month where I began to do my soul searching, and while at the time I wasnâ€™t overly happy looking back it was a rather peaceful and pleasant time that Iâ€™d kill to be in, but with getting closer to my friends it was kinda stressful as my lingering fear of rejection kicked in (a main reason why I donâ€™t really chase girls and never even asked a girl out). In the mid to late fall I really began to understand my wants and wishes and why I was who I was, based off of my past full of highs and lows and I settled on it being fifth grade as why it took so long to understand myself and be normal. November/December I finally began to see great results socially and was solidly with my friends. I was finally in the loop after years of trying to be (ironically this happened the year I stopped truly caring about popularity). I also began to really look out for others like this one girl who was in a similar spot to me of not knowing that few people like her, my personality wants to help but itâ€™s hard. Around late February I began to get really excited for the spring, particularly May and June and being a â€œpre-seniorâ€ and FINALLY partying once the seniors left. Everything was going amazing friend wise and grade wise, things were really looking up and I was the happiest Iâ€™d been, wondering for the future, then... COVID.

Yep, because I canâ€™t have good things COVID hit right in the best part of my school life. Now my senior year and my new social status are both in jeopardy. Weâ€™re either fully remote or hybrid to start the year (even though we should be in person). However, Iâ€™m applying for a job at a place my friends work at likely regardless (definitely if weâ€™re remote) so hopefully I can get my social interaction with them there if I have to. It really makes me sad because dammit I just want a happy ending and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna get it. However I tend to find that even years tend to be worse for me, and the worse they are, the better the next year is in terms of me being happy. 2014 was all around awful while 2015 I was back to being a happy kid. 2016 was a rollercoaster and 2017 was relatively good. 2018 was full of extremes, but mostly lows. 2019 also had some extremes, but mostly highs. 2020 has been a fucking pandemic, violent protests for almost 10 weeks now, a terribly toxic election cycle, and extreme global turmoil so by my logic an early vaccine will happen 2021, saving my senior year and making for one of the all time best years ever. But who knows?
