I miss the old days I miss the old days when i used to be a kid, have no worrys and my family actually loved each other. I miss the "friends" i used to have. I missed when i was innocent and not a complete mess. I miss hanging out with my friends and not being so alone. I miss not having to stress about life.

I dont know why i am writing this i guess writing stuff like this just helps me somehow
