Only weebs will understand Is it just me or has anime effected the way you walk past someone. Like you know in those animes where the two main characters (who havenâ€™t met) unknowingly walk past eachother and everything goes in slow mo and their hair goes all wooshy woozie, then it goes back to normal and they just continue doing whatever shit they do. Well every time I walk past someone when there arenâ€™t many people where Iâ€™m walking, Iâ€™ll walk past them and then think that they are my soulmate or some shit
