I thought I found a perfect girl for me but... So some time ago i met a cute girl. She was my age so i was feeling kind of confident while talking to her. We actually very liked each other and we were often talking or typing. But i thought she was giving me signs that she likes me more, like she wants to be more than just friends. So i spoke to her older brother who's my Great friend and he said that i have very, very, very high chances of her being my gf. One day i gathered all my confidence and told her. She was in kind of shock but she knew this day would come. I told her i find our hobbys, preferations etc. very similiar and i thought that she was giving me the signs. It turned out that no... she was nice because she IS nice. Also she told me she's lesbian so it's "impossible" for her to be with man in relationship. After that our relation was like, dead. I tried to maybe type with her but those are very short conversations. So uhh, yeah... that's my story. Also my self-esteem is very down again lol
