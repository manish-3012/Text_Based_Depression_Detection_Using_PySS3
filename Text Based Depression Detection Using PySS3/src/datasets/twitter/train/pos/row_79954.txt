This touches some minor religious topics, so if you're sensitive to that, be warned This is actually about a friendship type relationship, but i think this flair fits.

I got a friend who is part of a big, corrupt church, and he is really loyal to it. 

What this church does is: say to their people that they should give a big part of their salary to the church, because they should rely completely and exclusively on God, and not on "material things". They do that every 6 months, i think, and after the person is completely drained, and has no money to "donate", that person becomes an outcast, turns into a "bad person" , because they cant give any more money to the church.

I never was part of it, but i've gone there a few times since my friend invited me for some events, and judging by the extremely expensive buildings all around the country and the fancy props they use, i was getting suspicious. That suspicion became true after a famous model from here confirmed all that i said, and is now forming a lawsuit against their lies.

Now, back to my friend, he and his family have been loyal to that church as long as i can remember. I want to help him, but i am afraid that if i say that to him he will think i am a bad person, and am against God (yes, the church does that), and he will keep going to the church, but in his eyes, i will be his enemy.

What am i supposed to do in this situation?
