is it hard/expensive to live on ur own this started because literally everyone i know has a desk in their bedroom, is like a basic teenager thing, BUT I DONT HAVE ONE. also i share the bedroom with my TWO siblings and the worst part is that im not even poor; my mom has the money to buy or rent a better and/or bigger house where we all will be happier and more comfortable but she doesn't give a fuck i guess?

the point is that i wanna live on my own is it really very hard to do that???? my mom wants to move to another state or another country next year or the year after and i really don't want to because i wanna go to the university here so i'd have to stay in the city and live on my own in the smallest apartment i could afford but is it really hard to do that? im afraid i'd have to move out because i won't be able to do it. i guess i could get a job at a kindergarten because i worked at one in ny last year but would that be enough? also maybe my mom will lend me money? and im not one to buy stupid stuff and i already own a computer and a phone and clothes and a bed and netflix and i can cook and im a vegan so it's not very expensive. also university is free. but yeah idk what do u think older/wiser teenagers??

sorry this isn't readable im aware
