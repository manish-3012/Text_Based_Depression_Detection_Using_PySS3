im terrified that i wont cry when my parents die theyâ€™re completely healthy and fine currently. should live for another 20 or 30 years. 

the first time i experienced death was at 12 when my goldfish died. i didnt care at all. â€œoh wellâ€ i remember thinking. i also remember my dad saying jokingly â€œi hope you show a little bit more emotion when i die!â€

two years ago my grandpa died. we were very close and i held his hand as he died. i was conscious of the fact that i wasnâ€™t particularly upset. i was bummed to see my family so upset but i had to force myself to cry when the time finally came because everyone else was and it really scared me. 

this morning my dad texted me and said that my grandma had been sent to the hospital for unknown reasons. she goes to the hospital a lot, but this time seems different because hes not very religious and told me to pray for her. of course i hope shes ok and i did pray, but my first thought upon hearing this was â€œi hope this doesnt affect my plans for tonightâ€. what the fuck kind of reaction is that????

so now im realizing that i might feel the same way when my parents die. the greatest people ive ever known and i will feel indifferent when they leave. does anyone else feel like this or know why i feel like this? thanks
