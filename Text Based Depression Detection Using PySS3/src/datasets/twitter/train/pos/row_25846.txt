Idk what to do anymore So I'm not diagnosed with depresion,anxiety or social anxiety but I know I have them.I researched this mental illneses for about 1 year and I have every simptom of it.Is so shit.The problem that started all of this is my family. My parents are like in a fight since I was born and this year they decided to divorce.This shit is making me think of suicide every day.My mom is one the most restrictive mother in my highschool.She said that she knows that I have this illneses but she doesnt change at all.My father is there but he isnt that implicated with my life.I'm good at math so my mom makes do suplimentary work pretty much every day even tho I am the in my class and 3rd in school.She doesnt let me rest at all and I'm honestly tired of this shit and just wanna end it all.
