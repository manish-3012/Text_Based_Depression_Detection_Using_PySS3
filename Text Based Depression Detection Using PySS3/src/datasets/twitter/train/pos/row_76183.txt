I wish i had intervened 7 years ago when a girl in my class was constantly getting bullied! I was 12/13 back in fall of 2013, i remember when my classmates would make fun of this girl and i would laugh at the "jokes." I feel so ashamed thinking about it now that im 19. Please if you notice that someone is getting bullied PLEASE SPEAK UP! Don't be silent, and laugh!
