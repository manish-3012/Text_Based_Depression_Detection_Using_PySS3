Daily reminder: the value of someone else doesnâ€™t make you less valuable Therefore, trying to discredit someone else in order to be seen as better than them is not the way you should pursue. Work on yourself, itâ€™s gonna pay off. And stop giving a damn about â€œthem, you are you and you donâ€™t need no validation, you donâ€™t need to be better than anyone, you just need to be the best possible version of yourself.
