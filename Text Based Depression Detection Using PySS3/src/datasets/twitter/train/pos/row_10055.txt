I was too nervous to ask a girl on a date so SHE ASKED ME My heart is racing and I canâ€™t stop thinking about this and getting nervous. We get along very well and I like her too. A few days ago we had a convo about being lonely and wanting a wholesome relation with someone and what we would want in a relationship and we agree with each other. I made a comment about how I wish a girl would take the initiative, sweep me up and get in a relationship. Iâ€™ve always been too nervous to say anything to girls I liked and now this girlâ€™s asked me on a date and I think Iâ€™m gonna explode. Iâ€™ve never done this before, but I hope things go well! Wish me luck, guys! AND IF ITS YOU READING THIS, IM SORRY IM SO AWKWARD I LOVE YOU
