Some stupid shit I was hanging out with my friends a couple days ago during our schools lunch time then one of them started recreating the "Are you ready kids?" From SpongeBob except it was "Are you fucking me?" To which I responded (after the aye aye captain) "I can't feel it!" Everybody started cracking up. Thanks for coming to "Me telling you one of my only successes"
