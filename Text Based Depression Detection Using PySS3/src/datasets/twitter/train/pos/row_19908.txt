Another one of my irrational fears The ocean, I very much dislike it the ocean will not hesitate to kill you. There's bacteria, sharks, jellyfish, weird fucking fish, eals, and a fuck ton of other things some of which we haven't even discovered. Have you looked up the size of an angler fish it's over 3 feet long it's fucking terrifying. Something as big as the blue whale lives in the ocean the fact that something that big can survive is terrifying on its own.
