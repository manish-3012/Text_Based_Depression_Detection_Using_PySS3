How to I continue / start a text convo? I'm decently good friends with my crush, but we rarely text. I mostly just see her at school (twice a week now) and I've never really had an excuse to text her to start a conversation (I've texted one-off things about school but it never goes anywhere). This week we were talking about music and what stuff we listen to and I asked her to recommend some songs to add to my playlist and instead she made me a spotify playlist of 74 songs. I stayed up later than I should have listening to it and trying to start a conversation about some of it but nothing really happened. It's the longest text convo I've had with her so far, but still pretty short. I finished the playlist today and told her what I thought of the songs like she had asked but she just replied with "I'm glad u mostly liked it :)" and that's it. So I guess I'm just curious how to continue. I really liked having the short convo we had but idk how to keep talking. So yeah that's it. Thanks.
