sad but true. "Ok this is going to hit a lot of people on a whole 'nother level. Because, this is one of the most crushing, but truest things about reality nowadays. The people with the biggest smiles, the biggest hearts. The ones that care about people; the ones who would check up on friends, to make sure they're doing good. The ones who would give everything to go talk to a friend, if a friend was hurting, if a friend was in need, they would go out to visit them, even if it was early in the morning. These are the people that are hurting the most, these are the people who feel like they have no one in their lives who cares about them. They'll give all the love in the world, but they won't receive any love in return. These are the people that are hurting really bad. But they keep a smile on their face because they don't want other people to suffer the pain they've suffered."

This isn't my quote; honestly it came from a tiktok. All credit goes to the original person who said this. Some good can come out of bad things. But really, the message spoke to me and many others so I thought I would share it out; even if it's in writing and doesn't have emotional music in the background. Maybe you're the one who he was talking about, don't give up, we're all still in the woods.

Spread love.
