"It was a joke" So uh, basically, a guy I didn't like asked me out at school during a test before and I said no and he responded with, "it was a dare I was joking" and his friends started laughing. I keep thinking about this. I only ever saw that in shows and since I've never been asked out before or asked anyone out before I literally have no clue if that was even true. Help
