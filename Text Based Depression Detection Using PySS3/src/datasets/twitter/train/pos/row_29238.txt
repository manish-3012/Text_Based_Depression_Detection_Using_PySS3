On Wednesday I will officially not be able to Graduate. On Wednesday I will have run out of time to complete my online credit recovery course and will not have enough credits to graduate in my class of 2021. I've been absolutely swamped with work from my current classes on top of the recovery and life has been so hectic. I haven't told my parent how behind I am yet because I'm terrified of how they will think of me. I feel so useless and alone and there's nothing I can do but accept the consequences. Anyway I just needed a platform to let it all out, Good Luck in School everyone.
