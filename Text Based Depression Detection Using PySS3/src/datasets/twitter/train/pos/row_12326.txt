Is $350 a good price for a Nintendo Switch + accessories? I'm currently looking to sell my switch. Had it since 2017, so it's decently used. 1 or 2 small scratches on the screen, but they're pretty much unnoticeable when playing games.

I'd prefer to sell the console and everything I got for it as a bundle. This bundle would include:

Nintendo Switch Console
Dock
AC Adapter
Pro Controller
128GB SD Card
Carrying case
3 games (super mario odyssey, mk8 deluxe, pokemon sword)
Case for physical games

So would $350 be a good price for all that, or should I sell for more or less?
