I (17M)need advice on how to help my gf(16F) So my gf has recently told me that she is in a lot of stress and feels a lot of pressure on her mind. She basically wants to be completely alone in isolation for at least a week to relax, but can't because she has nowhere to go, and so on...
She tells me to not worry about it, but I can't stop thinking about it and I really want to help her.
Is it even possible for me to help her somehow??
