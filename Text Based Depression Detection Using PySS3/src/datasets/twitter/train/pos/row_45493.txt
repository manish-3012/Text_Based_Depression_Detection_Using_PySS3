Drugs fuck people up man Me and my dad got done working out and we went to the store and i saw my aunt sitting outside at like 10pmn, didn't recognize her until my dad said that was her when she got close because she walked off.. Couldn't even recognize her, abandoned her kids to. Shame... She was awesome before but i haven't talked to her in 5 years and probably never will.
