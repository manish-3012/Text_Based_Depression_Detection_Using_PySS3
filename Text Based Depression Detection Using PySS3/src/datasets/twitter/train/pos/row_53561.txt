Why is humanity like this... People not wearing masks and not respecting social distancing, protestors tearing down symbols of freedom and civil and human right and calling it â€œwhite supremacyâ€, a few years ago the anti vaccine â€œâ€â€movementâ€â€â€ happened because people thought they were smarter than doctors with PhDâ€™s. â€œThe earth is flatâ€,â€global warming isnâ€™t realâ€. It even goes all the way back to the 1800s. People denying basic science seems to be a basic human trait now, and I feel that that will be our own downfall as a civilization.
