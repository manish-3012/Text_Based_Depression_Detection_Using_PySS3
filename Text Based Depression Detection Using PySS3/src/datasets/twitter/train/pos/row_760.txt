A girl from my class asked me out And... I said no :/. But it's because she's not really that cute and nice to people and I also don't need anyone this early. But I send screens of the chat to my friend and told it to EVERYONE. Now she's getting bullied but I just think that's bs because why tf wpuld you get bullied because you like someone?! So yeah.. that's it
