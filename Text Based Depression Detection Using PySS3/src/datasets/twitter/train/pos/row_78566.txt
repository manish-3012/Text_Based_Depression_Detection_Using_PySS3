How do I tell my teacher that I have anxiety issues and that it's affecting my focus in class? My teacher isn't your typical boring english teacher, he's a great teacher and tries to get everyone to engage. However, he has this intense kinda vibe and my anxiety goes wild everytime I'm in his class because of the thought of him randomly choosing me to answer questions etc. This messes me up because I'm trying to focusing in class but my anxiety just takes over.
