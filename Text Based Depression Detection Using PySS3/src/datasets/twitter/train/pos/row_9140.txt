This kinda makes me mad https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJrj9Y1R/

Like I understand, I support gay rights and BLM, but to openly mock the support for cops is insulting. My uncles are cops and they put their heart and souls into their jobs. Theyâ€™re the nicest people I know and put their bodies on the line, my uncles have been ran over, shot, assaulted and so much more. Another good family friend is a cop, and we bought shirts with this logo on them after he was shot and ran over and nearly died. Some of our police are corrupt, thereâ€™s no doubt about it but at the same time there are people who become cops to protect and serve and to openly mock them saying â€œBlUE LivES MaTTeRâ€ is insulting. Am I being soft or is my criticism justified? (I have no problem with the pride flag itâ€™s just the open mocking of police)
