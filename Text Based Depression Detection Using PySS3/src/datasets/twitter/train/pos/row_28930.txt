does anyone else feel this way ? idk how to start , does anyone else feel invalid by other peoples pain ? as an example , feeling like your depression/whatever isn't valid or important cause someone else has depression or has it worse ? this is a really deeply rooted and complicated situation for me so there's obviously more to it then what I said . but that's kinda the only way I can describe it . I just feel really alone and I'm curious
