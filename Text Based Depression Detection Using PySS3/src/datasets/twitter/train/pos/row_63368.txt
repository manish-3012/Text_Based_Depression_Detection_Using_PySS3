anyone else feel super uncomfortable around their dad lol idk heâ€™s kind of a racist and homophobic piece of shit and my mom is always trying to get us to â€œbondâ€

whenever my dad offers to take us out to eat she always says â€œwhy donâ€™t u two just go haha daddy daughter date bonding timeðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªâ€ and i fucking hate it iâ€™m pretty sure it makes us both uncomfortable
