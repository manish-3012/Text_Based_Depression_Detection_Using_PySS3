How do I make sure I stay financially stable for the future? I'm a sophomore in high school and I keep thinking about the future such as will I get my dream job, how do I do taxes, and how do I stay stable with my money? I just want to learn if there is something I can do now to make sure I can afford my needs in my life and the things I want. (Console, decent looking car, etc.) I just wanna here different ideas from people so I can sort of get an idea on what I can do. Sorry if this question is sort of vague and confusing, I'm not very good at wording things lol
