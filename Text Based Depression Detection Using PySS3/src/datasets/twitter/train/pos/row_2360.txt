Sometimes I genuinely scare myself This isn't an "im edgy" post, but some of the things that come into my head genuinely scares me. Like I will think of a very detailed way to kill someone. Or I also will just randomly get the inspiration to make my arm look like a hotdog bun, and need to activately fight not to go through with it. I am genuinely concerned about myself. Dont worry about me in the comments or dms please, im ok
