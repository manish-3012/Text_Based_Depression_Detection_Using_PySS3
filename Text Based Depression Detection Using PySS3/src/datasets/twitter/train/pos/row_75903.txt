And instead of learning about Latin and Greek well you do in a roundabout way this gentleman talks to you for a full two hours thatâ€™s how long the class. Was that day about the importance of history language and culture to humanity what happens when one man tries to destroy an entire people group and how the preservation of language can protect a culture and protect the spirit of humanity. He mentions everything from having to bring in scrap pieces of paper after the war to shops to in order to purchase new notebooks for school they preserved and collected paper well into the 50s in Germany and they made people bring an old scraps of it to be recycled since paper was a limited commodity at that point,  He mentioned playing with friends on his street that would disappear randomly that he didnâ€™t realize until he was about six or seven that his friends had been Jewish and that they had been taken.
