My school is discriminating So, I just got my 2019 yearbook, over half of the people in 8th grade voted me for nicest person. But, as you would have guessed, the gay pride person who was not funny and was really annoying got the spotlight. I'm going through my parents divorce, I still tried to stand out and be as nice as possible, I donated over 75 hard earned dollars to the club's, I stayed after school to help with events and other stuff. I tried my hardest but the gay guy with only 100 votes, got it. I don't care if you are gay, you don't get extra privileges because you like dicks. I'm so pissed off right now.
