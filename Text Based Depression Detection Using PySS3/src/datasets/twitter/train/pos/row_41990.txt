I smoke cigarettes I don't smoke to look 'cool'. I only smoke when nobody is watching. I usually smoke at home or during school breaks behind a store.

I smoke because I feel like shit. I'm always stressed out and feeling down. Smoking makes me feel relaxed.

Im definitely addicted. My health has worsened as well. I have a persistent cough. My lung capacity has also worsened.

I don't know if I'll ever quit. I just wanted to share this to someone.
