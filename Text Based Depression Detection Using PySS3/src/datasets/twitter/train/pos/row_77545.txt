If you are a Unity game developer and want to join a team, I'm forming a team of Unity devs and designers and we're going to make fun games.

You will get not only more experience but a portfolio of published games that you might want to use for your college application.

You have to be determined and committed. We only have 2 sports remaining.

You don't need a ton of experience but should know how to code and work with Unity.

Please DM me or comment if interested!
