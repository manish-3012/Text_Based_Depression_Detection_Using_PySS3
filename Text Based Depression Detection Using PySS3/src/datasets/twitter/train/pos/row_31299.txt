Today is the one year anniversary of me getting rid of my homophobia I was born in lebanon were we don't really get alot of education on this stuff (it's legal but it's social suicide to be gay outside of Beirut) , so one year ago I decided to research why do people "choose" to be gay and turns out they don't, shocking I know, so today I have completed one year of not being homophobic
