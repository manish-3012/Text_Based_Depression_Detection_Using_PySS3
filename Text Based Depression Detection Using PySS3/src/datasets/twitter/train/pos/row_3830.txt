My Iphone got hacked and am scared This is embarrassing but I was watching hentai on phone (Plz dont judge me lol) and all of the sudden my phone starts doing weird shit and starts going to the home without me touching anything then it tried uninstalling my apps. At this point I was like yea its probadly a glitch or something. So I turn my iphone off and turned it back on and then immediately it tried to start uninstalling my apps again. At this point my heart stops I think to myself that this hacker thinks am a idiot then proceed to to try to turn off my wifi, bluetooth, and data but it wont let me because the hacker is to prevent me from doing that. So i turn siri on and off to try to fuck with the hacker and get a chance to turn off my phone again. The third time I turn my phone on I waited like 15mins and then fucking zoomed to turn off my data, bluetooth, and wifi. This time I beat him and go to my settings and reset my network connections. My phone restarts again I turn off everything that can be used to connect to my phone. I then noticed my wallpaper was gone an that my phone was in light mode when I always have it on dark mode. I get scared an turn off my phone. 

Some background info I noticed weird hookup stuff on my iphone calender that I didnt know how to remove about a month ago. Today I got 2 calls from 2 numbers I didnt know that left a voice email about debt so I ignored it as well. Also got a scam likely call during work.

Short Summary: I got my phone hacked and manage to turn off my data, wifi, and bluetoth before he could hack into my personal info. I managed to delete my network connections on my Iphone before having a panic attack. 

I was wondering if anybody has had anything similar happen to them and could give some advise about what to do. Any help is usefull.

Also I wrote this whole thing on a school laptop that has a broken keyboard ):
