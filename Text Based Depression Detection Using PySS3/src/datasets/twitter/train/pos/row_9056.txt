Going back to school I'll be honest I'm scared shitless to go back to school this year, I mean I really want to and know it would be better for me in terms of education and I'd love to see my friends again but I'm scared, because someone could die this year, whether it be a student or a teacher, the question is just if someone will die of corona or a shooting first and that is scary. I am not prepared to lose classmates or friends, but I know that I have to go back and I do want to go back it's just scary you know
