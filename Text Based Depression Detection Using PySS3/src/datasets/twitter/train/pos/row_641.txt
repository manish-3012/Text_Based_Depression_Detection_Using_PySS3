Need some advice So I am a 17 male and I have a crush on a 16 male! I see myself as bi though.
The thing is my crush has already a girlfriend and even though I tried to tell him that I love him he didn't get the hints!

Right now I don't know of its good to tell him or not? I do know that he is OK with people being gay and stuff.

I should also need him to help me with my depression! I really belive he could help me but I am to afraid to ask! 

So I could use some advice 
PS first time after posting something on a forum and asking for help 

Thanks in advance!
