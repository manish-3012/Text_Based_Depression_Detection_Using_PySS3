Is it weird that i like to hear stories about empowered women even if im a guy? Now hear me out, i dont mean it in the fact that as a guy is weird that i like it instead of dont caring, i mean it in the fact that i cant get enough of empowered women stories, example: I know more about Anne Bonny and Mary Read along with Ching Shih that i know from Blackbeard or other male pirates. You could say that i have a thing for empowerd women? Not in the way of finding them attractive or anything, i just cant get enough with the stories, i find it so cool an interesting! Like, i found out about this page called "rejectedprincesses" that is about real badass women who achieved great things or that at least did a couple badass things and i swear i cant get enough. Idk, i guess i just wanted to have other people opinion.

Serious tag to prevent from people just commenting simp as if it was the funniest thing ever.
