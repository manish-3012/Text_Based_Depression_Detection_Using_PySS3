Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Anyways to recap last week,

Some ship got stuck in a canal.

Another ship came and crashed into that ship and got more stuck. Might have been a semi truck.

Oh then the same thing happened with some other vehicle.

The lesson of the week: don't do drugs. Unless they prevent you from crashing cars or boats. In that case take the whole bottle because you're gonna need them.


Also a small orange bell pepper died in super mario bros.
GG mr bell pepper.

F in the chat.


Coming up next week: terrorist attack on amber heard
