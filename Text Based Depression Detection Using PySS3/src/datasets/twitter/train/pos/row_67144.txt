I had i really disturbing dream last night It started with me driving around the country, I've never dived but for some reason I felt like I was going really fast, but the world around me didn't change, it went by as if i was going at a normal speed.

The dream is out of order so I'm saying it in the order shit happened

I was in the house a house id moved out of 6 years ago in the living room where I just murdered a girl in my class i used to have a crush on 2 years ago. I don't recall how I actually murdered her, she was dead though. Body was purple and covered with orange and red wounds. Her intestines were sticking out her right breast for some reason. I saw them and I took a section of intestine and tore it in half, and proceeded to take a small mouse and shove it on the intestine. The girl wasn't dead, however, she sobbed softly. 

Now I'm back in the car, and this other car is behind me going fast. 

Yknow how sometimes in dreams you can see things in another building even though you're in a completely different place? That happened.

A group of girls I know we're all in a black car chasing me. And I was going fast too but i guess not enough.

For some reason i stop and jump out the car and start running inhumanly fast. The girls couldn't catch up, and were also out of the car.

Then i remember doing parlour, it felt like i was, although i was just running in between very narrow spaces in between buildings of a town I think i remember. The girls had now catched up to me. The moment one lays a hand on me in back in my childhood house.

Then I'm back in my house panicked and pacing. I go get a knife and stick in right in my addamsapple. The knife sunk like a 1000 degree knife going into a cake. With blood waterfalling down my body. I dropped.

The last thing i remember us all the girls celebrating by texting each other.

What the fuck is wrong with me.
