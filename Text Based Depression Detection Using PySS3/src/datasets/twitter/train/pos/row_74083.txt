Today I did something that made me really proud of myself So I have a comic and I recently switched from ibisPaint to procreate. This meant that I also got a new iPad. Sadly my old iPad was so old that it wasnâ€™t on iOS 11 so I couldnâ€™t transfer any of my data.
In ibisPaint I had a special font that was my own handwriting converted into one but as I said none of my data could be transferred so I thought it was gone for good......until I came up with a brilliant idea.

Basically what I did was I logged into my â€œcalligraphrâ€ account through ibisPaint and copied the file name from the site (my old font was still magically saved on that site but only through ibisPaint) and after I copied the file name I pasted it into an email that I then sent to myself. After that I opened the link and the normal â€œdownload file?â€ message popped up! It saved to â€œmy filesâ€ as an otf file and I could import it to procreate! 

Iâ€™m not a very technical gal so the fact that I did this makes me so happy and proud of myself. 

I just wanted to share my accomplishment of the day and maybe you learned something new as well :) 

Take care!
