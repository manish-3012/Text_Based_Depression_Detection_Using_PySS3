How to know if a shy girl is interested Thereâ€™s this girl in some of my classes, sheâ€™s really shy. Iâ€™ve had her in a class before so I do know her and she knows me. Iâ€™m really not sure if she likes me though or if she is even interested to begin with. She doesnâ€™t use social media often, so she doesnâ€™t text much just for fun. Iâ€™ve been trying to start some conversations with her and she doesnâ€™t mind talking to me (although she is a bit more comfortable when theres someone with us). Sheâ€™s friendly, laughs at my jokes. She doesnâ€™t start many conversations herself, Iâ€™m always the one asking her about things she likes. 

I donâ€™t want to make her feel bad about me or herself, so I donâ€™t want to just ask her yet. What should I do to â€˜testâ€™ if she would like to become closer and possibly have a relationship?
