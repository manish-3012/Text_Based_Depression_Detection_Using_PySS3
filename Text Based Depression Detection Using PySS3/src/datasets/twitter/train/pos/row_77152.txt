Does anyone know why my YouTube ads are in Welsh? I speak English and German but I live in Wales. I don't search or watch anything in Welsh. Only ever English or German. Is it just because I live in Wales? If so, that's annoying and I don't know how to stop it. I have searched for answers but it's more difficult than I thought.
