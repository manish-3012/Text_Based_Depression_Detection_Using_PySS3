I'm dying inside a little bit So I changed my Zoom keys to make ctrl + d the unmute button because of google meet using ctrl + d to unmute. I didn't think much of it. So I'm drawing in [aggie.io](https://aggie.io) and i need to deselect something. So I click ctrl + d, realize i drew everything on one layer, and I said "FUCK." Then I hear "Simone, why do you think that?" Now I'm gonna die inside because the only teacher I like has heard me curse not once, but twice. (The other time that I cursed was when I unmuted my mic to hand in my test and went "shit, I did horrible" by accident while I was leaving.) I don't know if he actually heard me curse that time, but it's getting to my head that he potentially heard me curse. Kinda afraid for my grade not gonna lie :/
