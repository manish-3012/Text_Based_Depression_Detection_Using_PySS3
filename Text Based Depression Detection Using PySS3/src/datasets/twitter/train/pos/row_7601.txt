I fucking hate myself So for the first half of the year, my entire country went into lockdown due to COVID. Online learning literally fucked me up so badly. But it was my own fault as I kept getting distracted. 

In the end, for my common tests I went from the top half of the class to the near bottom. Luckily, this was a wake up call for me and it spurred me on to work harder.

Some background first. My school uses the MSG  (Mean Subject Grade) system, which takes the average grade for all your subjects. The lower the better, which means the best possible grade is 1.00 which means all your subjects are A1. Iâ€™m currently Sec 2 (14 years old). During Sec 2, itâ€™s especially important to get a good MSG, as it can help you to get into your desired courses and sometimes even Talent Programmes. Talent Programmes are like specialised courses. You must get real good MSG and good conduct in general to get into such Programmes.

So finally, after 6 months of seriously cutting down on gaming and anime, my MSG improved from 3.00 to 1.14, literally one of the best possible. And guess what? I got rejected for all the Talent Programmes while my friend who got 1.7 managed to get in.

I can only deduce itâ€™s due to my shitty conduct and behaviour for the first half of the year. My school takes very high priority in conduct so if you donâ€™t have a very good record, you are quite fucked. Thereâ€™s no one else to blame but myself for this, so Iâ€™m still so fucking pissed at myself.

However, you are allowed to submit an appeal letter if you still really want to get into the course or programme you want. Now, all I hope for is my appeal is successful.

Thatâ€™s all. Thank you for reading my rant. I just had to get this out.
