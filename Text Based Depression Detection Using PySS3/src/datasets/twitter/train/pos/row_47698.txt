Ok so I got good grades after a year of hardwork. People never appreciate me much..I am not joking when I say this. I knew I would have to perform out of the box to achieve something and that's what I did.  After years of hardwork I finally managed to get at least an A in all subjects. I know people might not care but yet I'm sharing.
