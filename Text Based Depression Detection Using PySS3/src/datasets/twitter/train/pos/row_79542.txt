I did my own research on blm I looked at videos and articles of George Floyd, ahmaud arbery and Jacob Blake because I was told to look at the facts and do my own research instead of just trusting other people and I now see what exactly people are mad about, I understood before and I support blm but, just seeing the actual videos, thatâ€™s so much different than hearing about it. Hearing a man cry out for his mother while a police officer who is supposed to protect and serve slowly kills him, and watch and a man jogging be shot dead in the street and see someone WALKING TO THERE CAR GET SHOT 7 TIMES. As a white person I never really understood and I never will fully understand but just seeing these videos and knowing there are so much more that are known about and even more that arenâ€™t itâ€™s scary and itâ€™s infuriating and it helps me understand why we should fight for equality in America. I just remembered the first time I saw the video of Jacob Blake I cried, and I told my girlfriend and she told me not to watch videos like that but I canâ€™t just ignore the facts, I canâ€™t ignore the fact people are being gunned down and killed for no more reason than being black I want to do something I want to be there to help I donâ€™t want to just stand by. Iâ€™ve found out about a blm rally really close to me but If you guys have other ideas Iâ€™d like to hear them
