I cried for the first time in years so these last months have been rough for me, some social problems, some school problems, you know, typical stuff. well, this last week i got to know that i failed a class and that really hit hard. i was scared to tell my parents about it since it would affect my scholarship and my school isnâ€™t that cheap, you know?

so yeah, today, after 3-4 years, i cried for the first time and i must say, it felt so good. i feel refreshed. it is like if all those years of keeping things to myself finally stopped being a charge. 

i still have to tell them and it probably wont go very well, but now i feel more relaxed and confident to do it.

i just wanted to say it because i felt like i needed to. if someone actually read this, thank you for doing so and have a good day :))
