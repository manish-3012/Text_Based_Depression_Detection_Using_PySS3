What have I done I was angry at myself because I procrastinated on studying for a test and did terrible so of course my parents both yelled but they said that they give up and told me that I could go be a carpenter or a plumber and to not ever cry to them about where I end up. I agreed with them tho I was mad, and then when my friend was texting me I kinda yelled and insulted them and now I'm just in remorseful despair, any advice?
