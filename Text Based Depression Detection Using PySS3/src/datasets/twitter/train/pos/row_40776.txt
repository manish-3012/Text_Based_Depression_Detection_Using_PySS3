all my work is turned in. I think I'm going to get a B in English. I can't handle that, I NEED A's. I'm so worried that if I don't get an A  I won't survive this. I'm so unstable that I don't know what will happen, all I know is that it won't end well. I don't know what to do, I tried my best I tried as hard as I could. I'm in 11th grade English, but I'm only a freshman, I was supposed to exceed expectations, I was supposed to do beyond amazing.  I have a 91 in math and I'm very very very afraid that I will get a B, and that will be even worse than getting just one B.. I don't know what to do about this... the semester is ending... what do I do to make sure I stay okay???
