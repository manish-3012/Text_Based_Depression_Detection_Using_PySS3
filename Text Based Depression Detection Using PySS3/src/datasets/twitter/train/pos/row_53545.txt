This is my rant on people ranting about parents lmao I see so many negative posts about parents on here, and its *mainly* posts like "my mom took my new ps5 away for a month and idk how she could do this, it was my Christmas present and now all my friends are playing minecraft but I can't" shii like that. Look, maybe in the moment it's a little upsetting, but they literally have to deal with a hormonal crazy teen all day every day lmao. Yeah, it wasn't cool. But like, yk how many kids read those posts wishing they could even get punished by their parents one more time because they passed? Or maybe, their parents are abusive and they just wish those were their punishments? All you make yourself seem like is a spoiled, parent hating kid. Please give your parents appreciation...
