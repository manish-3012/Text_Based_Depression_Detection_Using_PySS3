Quarantine project I made that you all can enjoy from :)  Hey all!

During all of quarantine I started to get really bored so I started thinking what's something I could do that will be useful and be fun for me. After thinking of what I could do for a while, I decided on making a podcast. Well rather 2. Both of my podcasts are targeted towards teens and young adults, and I think everyone here could like one of them.

For the Boys is a community driven podcast where we talk about men's issues. I've always felt like there aren't many outlets for men to talk about their issues which tend to result in many guys keeping all of their emotions inside and letting it out in inappropriate ways. I hope to tackle these issues that you all have. I want to talk about the issues you deal with during your life and talk about it with you to hopefully come to a solution with you and for everyone else listening. Hopefully with everyone coming on and talking about their day to day issues, more people will see that they aren't alone with their issues and it will provide a safe space to work them through.

Entertainment Bites is a podcast that gives everything pop culture related, to you on a plate. I try to get all the big pop culture news of the week and then I deliver it in a fast paced platform. I'm hoping to make it easier for everyone to know what's happening in the entertainment world, weather it be video games, movies, tv, music. Anything in pop culture I try to deliver it quickly for you, so you don't have to waste hours of your week looking for facts. No rumors over here.

If either of these interest you I would be forever grateful if you took a listen! [Click here](https://linkkle.com/aidan) to listen to either podcast or follow their socials! Any advice or even just a listen means so much to me. Don't forget you're all amazing &lt;3
