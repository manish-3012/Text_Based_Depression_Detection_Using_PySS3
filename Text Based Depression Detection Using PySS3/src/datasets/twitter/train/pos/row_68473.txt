question regarding a girl sorry for the generic post people who sort by new. I like this girl and have pretty much since I met her and I told her when I did. She said she wasn't ready for a relationship, it's now 2 years later and she has been really flirty recently. It's really hard for me to read her when we are in person and even worse over text though so I could just be misreading. My thought was I could just confess but I also want to make it clear that if she says she doesn't like me back I would like to keep her as a friend (she's my best friend). I know the thing when you tell someone you like them and then are like "it's ok though no pressure" that it's kinda shit is there a better way to do it/should I do it at all?
