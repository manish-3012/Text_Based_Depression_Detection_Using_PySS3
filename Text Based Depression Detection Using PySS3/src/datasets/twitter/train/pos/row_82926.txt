Girls can be simps too So this is something that happened to me a while ago where I was simped on

During the trend where we would take selfies of ourselves, I decided to join in and post myself (I deleted the post after this) and not 10 seconds later I got a dm from a throwaway account saying the following word for word: â€œhey 15f. Ur hot af.â€ Now I wasnâ€™t really creeped out by this. On the contrary, I was flattered, so after school I thanked her. Then the next morning, at like 6:30 AM she told me to talk to her on kik. Now I didnâ€™t have kik, and when I told her she insisted I got it, so I did, even though it says itâ€™s 18+. Afterwards I added her, and she said she wanted another pic of me. I declined, because I wasnâ€™t even supposed to be awake yet and I was too tired, and she sent a picture of herself (she was wearing clothes donâ€™t worry), and I noticed that she didnâ€™t look 15. She probably just looked older than she was, which is pretty common, but I wasnâ€™t gonna take any risks. I deleted kik, went back to Reddit and blocked her account. 

Thereâ€™s other examples of people simping for me, but you get it. Iâ€™m not saying all girls simps and trying to defend boys acting like simps to be an incel, all Iâ€™m saying is that everyone can be a simp on the internet regardless of gender.
