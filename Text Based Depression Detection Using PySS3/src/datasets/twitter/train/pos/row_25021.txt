I think i figured it out So when i was with my step dad i was extremely suicidal well i don't think it was cause he was abusive but because i came to realize that i was being replaced they didn't need me anymore i didn't need to help with the kids my sister could have asked him for help i wasn't needed anymore cause my step dad did what i could do for the family but alot better math homework he was a straight a student my mom didn't have to work so she had all the time with the kids he kept the house stable and what was i doing avoiding contact with them i always had thought about if i chugged the entire bleach bottle that they couldn't do anything the closet hospital and ER where kinda far and i could have done this while they where away just cause i thought i was being replaced i don't know why you read this if it was cause you had to much time in you hands or something but thanks i appreciate it a lot
