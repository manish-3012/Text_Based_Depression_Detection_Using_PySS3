So, Iâ€™ve realized I have a crush. So thereâ€™s this guy . Iâ€™d say weâ€™re pretty good friends and we have really nice conversations. When I first met him I didnâ€™t really think of him that way, considering he was dating someone at the time. Iâ€™m âœ¨notâœ¨ about that. Heâ€™s currently single now and a few of our friends think he has a crush on me or  they want us together, like his ex girlfriend wants us together. New friends have even said that they think weâ€™d be really cute together! Heâ€™s really sweet, but I donâ€™t really know if he actually thinks of me like that. A mutual friend said he looks at me differently and he checks on me more. 

Part of me really doubts it, but then again Iâ€™m really bad at recognizing that and I havenâ€™t had the best experiences when it comes to crushes. 

Anyways. We were on a group call and his younger sister was there (2). She was doing something and he wanted to show us her hair. To call her over he said â€œHoney.. sweetheart come here.â€ AND I SWEAR ðŸ¥º My heart leapt out of my chest. He said it in the softest tone too, it was so sweet. 

Iâ€™d been thinking that I liked him for awhile, but man did that take the cake. It was so wholesome too I- it was just something.
