hi everyone good afternoon how are u. reply now or else [unfiltered thougjts inside] my alarm was set for 11;30am and umm i didnt wake up until 2:30pm so thats fun and cool but theres like a whole hurricane happening so i dont think i had any plans today anyway. also on my post looking for other aromantic people on the sub this guy was like "im sure there are people here who havent had romantic feelings yet". wdym "yet" lil boy im lookin for people who dont feel romantic attraction not late bloomers !!

anyway now im thinking in depth about myself identifying as aromantic coz ive had relationships in the past (acrually had a nightmare last night where my ex kept stalking me which kinda happened irl
but u know) but every time ive ever looked back on my relationships i was like nahhh that did not feel right. i always had to force myself into the relationship and that was always followed by this super intense discomfort unless i was intoxicated lmaoooasdkskfk and the actual romantic parts squicked me out eww !! 

but like i cared about those people a lot at the time and i thought a relationship was naturally the next step because of amatonormativity plus there were some things about like insecurity in there and im not asexual so it's like a confusing bomb of emotions ðŸ’”ðŸ’”

oops i did NOT mean to rant gotta go ðŸƒâ€â™€ï¸

BUT TELL ME how are yall doin whats up !! if ur in range of the hurricane i hope ur stayin safe xoxoxo
