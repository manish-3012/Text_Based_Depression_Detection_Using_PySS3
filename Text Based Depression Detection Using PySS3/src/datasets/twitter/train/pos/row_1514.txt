Iâ€™m just gonna be honest a lot of girls on this subreddit get offended to easily and are so quick to argue(itâ€™s not all girls) Like im actually done, if you say anything negative that they donâ€™t like, I posted a while ago saying â€œI donâ€™t like it when girls when make up, then can but itâ€™s my preferenceâ€, Jesus Christ so many people come at you, I got called sexist, incel, so badly. Like itâ€™s so annoying, sometimes, I was telling this story about how this guy made fun of a girl in school and roasted her, like wildin out and every one came at my neck, I didnâ€™t even say the joke I was just telling the story, but hella people got mad at me, people were calling me an asshole even though the girl was okay with the joke. Its so annoying, if a saying anything and I mean I anything remotely negative about anything a woman supports itâ€™s over.like how i donâ€™t like Mia khalifa, itâ€™s over, I got hundreds of downvotes because a woman canâ€™t possibly be wrong even though she lied about a lot. Itâ€™s so annoying I canâ€™t take it anymore, some of you guys just love to argue over everything you donâ€™t like, Iâ€™m actually tired of it, yâ€™all need to respect otherâ€™s opinions, just because someone doesnâ€™t agree with you doesnâ€™t make them the asshole/incel.
