iâ€™m soooooo tired of everyone calling everything racist for some reason, people do NOT understand the difference between racial stereotypes and actual racism. for example, if thereâ€™s a youtube comment saying something about basic white girls, the reply section is all â€œracistâ€ â€œthatâ€™s kinda racist :/â€œ â€œdonâ€™t be racistâ€ and all that stuff. sure racial stereotypes *can* be harmful, but theyâ€™re not the same as being racist. i wish those people would actually take a minute to google what the word racist actually means before saying that. ik nobody cares about this, but nobody else listens to me so iâ€™m ranting here. thank you for coming to my ted talk
