Help me with my new echo dot please!! It keeps playing radio stations of playlists instead of the actual playlist (I am aware this isnt' the perfect sub to post this on but its more active and probably has a lot of teenage echo users I presume. I would be grateful to receive some help from fellow teens thx!) 

I unboxed my echo dot yesterday and I have to say, it's pretty awesome. Except for the fact that spotify keeps playing the radio station of a playlist instead of the actual playlist. I've scoured the internet for solutions. I've tried resetting it, disconnecting it from power, praying to god, resetting my alexa app, etc etc etc.

This problem seems to be quite prominent so I wonder why it's not been fixed yet
