Help guys, do you want to discuss history? Two of my passions are history and politics. I would like to discuss history in either World War Two, Vietnam, and late antiquity in the Roman era. I would like to swap ideas about theories, strategies and lessons that these time periods could have on modern times, and to also tell you my ideas and insights. Please be a little educated about these topics and feel free to dm me!
