GIRLFRIEND is probably going to break up with me She seemed mad at me last night so I asked her and she said I seemed desperate and itâ€™s not attractive, do I have not confidence things like that and she didnâ€™t reply to me by end. I told her Goodmorning and if we can talk(you know to see If I did something) and she was like â€œyea we need to talk itâ€™s bad at school tho donâ€™t replyâ€, can I get some advice men and females on what to do or expect
