What was your favorite show as a kid? He man was my favorite show when I was 6,7,8 and 9. I was obsessed with it. I still remember being in the back seat of the car with a small DVD player and 2 different he-man season disc that I have watched like 100 times. I also remember my favorite character was Skeletor.
