Beat up by my younger brothers bully I'm an 18 yo girl and my brother is 11. He was bullied pretty badly by a boy in his class and was even scared to walk home from school. One day I decided to teach the little brat a lesson. I went to their school when they quit and started following my brother from a distance, hoping the bully would appear. Eventually he did and as he started pushing and beating my brother I ran up to them. I had never seen the kid before, he looked like a classic bully, big and almost obese. I started yelling at him, telling him to leave my brother alone and so on, but he wasn't scared at all. He just laughed and said something rude, and then he pushed me up against a tree really hard. As I tried to break free the stupid brat grabbed my panties and gave me a wedgie! I screamed in shock (and pain) and cried out for my brother to help get him off me, but he was just standing there and didn't know what to do. The boy told me I should mind my own business (and to be honest I wished I had). Luckily at this point a car came by and the boy let me go. Me and my brother ran the rest of the way home and I told him we'd never speak of this again... I was so embarrassed, getting owned by someone that young! Don't know how to handle it though
TL;DR Tried to help my brother but got my ass kicked instead
