Can your looks have an effect on your personality? Because there seems to be a connection with how you look and how you act. I'm not saying that all people who look certain way *are* a certain way. All I'm saying is that from my personal experience people who look a certain way seem to be more likely to act in a certain way than others. 

I think there might be some correlation. For example new people might be more likely to talk to a pretty person rather than an ugly person. This could then result in prettier people being more extroverted. 

So do you think that looks might have an effect on your personality?
