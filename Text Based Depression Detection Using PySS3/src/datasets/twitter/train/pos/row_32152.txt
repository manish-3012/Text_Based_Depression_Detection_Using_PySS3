I'm on my school computer right now normally the school computers have a thing that blocks websites that count as gaming, social media, forums, etc. but me and my friend found out how to get past that. so yeah i can go on reddit, discord, twitter, twitch, anything really.

so this may not work on any school computer since they may use different programs to block websites but here is how i did it. 

I don't know how exactly but i was able to download "brave browser" on it. when i tried that it still didn't work, then my friend told me to use a VPN and that brave browser would let me get one

then i  got a chrome extension called "setup VPN" but i think any one would work.

then just connect to another country (the UK is what i used) and boom you can use any website on it
