i got a surgery yesterday and i hate it ive had trouble breathing through my nose for about 4 years and i got told by an ENT doctor that i had a deviated septum, long story short i got the surgery to resolve it and my nose has been bleeding constantly for over 24 hours, i have to sleep sitting up, i have to change my nose gauze every 30
min because there is so much blood, i cant eat anything cuz the gauze get in the way and it hurts to talk because i now have to sleep and breathe with my mouth open constantly and my throat is fucking raw. they said ill be bleeding for 2-5 days and i wont fully recover for 2 weeks, sorry i just wanted to rant and i feel better now, bye
