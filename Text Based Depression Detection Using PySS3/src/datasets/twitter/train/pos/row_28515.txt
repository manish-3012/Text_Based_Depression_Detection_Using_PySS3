I got cheated on, now I'm sad I started dating this girl I've known for a long time about 3 and a half months ago. It was great she made me happy and I dont really feel happy very often anymore and I told her that. I made sure to be the best boyfriend I could be, I was caring and I texted her and made her laugh as often as I could.

Then about a week ago out of the blue after ignoring my texts all day she messages me saying we just need to talk, she calls me and breaks up with me all suddenly. I'm pretty shocked and sad because I though everything was just fine, literally 2 days ago I had gone and seen her in a play she was in and told her she did an amazing job. So now I'm sad and confused.

Then one of my best friends starts acting weird and I find out he's texting her while we're playing dnd which is just kinda rude, then he tells me a couple days later that she came onto him super hard before we even broke up and she broke up with me mid flirting with him to make him more comfortable, and literally the next day they were fucking.

I confronted her about it and she said it was true but didn't apologize for anything. I wasn't rude just saying that I'm confused and didn't know how to feel, she gave me the "K" and I was done.

I never got any in the relationship even tho I let her know all she had to do was ask if she was horny, but she fucked my friend on their first "date."

Now I see her wearing his jackets in the hallways at school and posts about each other on Instagram, and I'm pissed at both of them and very sad. Not only did I lose someone I loved and though they loved me, I lost a friend who valued some unfaithful girl over our 5 years of friendship.

I dont post like ever but I needed to get this off my chest.
