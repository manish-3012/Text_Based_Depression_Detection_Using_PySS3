so apparently i got the wrong vaccine lmao my neighbor works with the elderly and was given 50 vaccine spots to be given out and since both of my parents are susceptible i qualified to get the vaccine, the place i went to get it was supposed to be giving out fyzer which has been allowed to be given to people 16-18+ i think but instead they gave me  maderna (idk if i spelled either of these correctly but who cares) which has not been licensed to be given to 16 year olds, so ya i guess im apart of the tests now?
