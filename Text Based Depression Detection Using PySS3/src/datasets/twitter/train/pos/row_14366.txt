What the fuck do I do My dad has a high blood pressure and pulse, 120bpm. But he said he doesnt want to go to a doctor. I feel like I cant even stay home because all I could think about is my dads health and constantly checking if he is okay. My mom has tried to convince him but he wont budge. What can I do? Im now taking a walk to relieve my stress.
