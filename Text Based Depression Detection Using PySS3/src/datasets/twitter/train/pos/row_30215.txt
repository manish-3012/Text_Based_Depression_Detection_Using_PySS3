jackass on the freeway we are on a 4 hour drive, a dumbass in his toyota Tacoma keeps passing us going ~90 mph then slowing down again we catch up and pass, a couple minutes later here comes toyota guy speeding on by. A whole highway patrol officer saw all of this. I have never been more satisfied when I saw the cop flip his lights
