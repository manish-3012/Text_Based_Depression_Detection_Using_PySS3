I came out to my friend as gay FINALLY! So I was walking with her on a road and there was a rumor that I liked her and I just told her 
-can I tell you something 
-year sure
-it's kinda hard to say 
-wdym
-I might be gay 
-WHAT
-is something wrong?
-no I'm just happy that the rumor is false and thank you for trusting me it's ok to be gay 

I'm really happy I got her and I just wanted to share it with y'all. I'm also planning to come out to my family soon, they are possibly homophobic but she can help me if they kick me out or harass me. Wish me good luck
