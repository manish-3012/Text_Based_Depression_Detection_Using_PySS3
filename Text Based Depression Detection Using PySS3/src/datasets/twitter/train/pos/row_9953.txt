Hey guys, just a bit of a talk. I've seen slot of bad shit these past few days. Someone's girlfriend committed suicide, that's a good example of some of the things I've seen. My life is absolutely shit right now, a week and a couple days into being 17 and my entire world got flipped upside down, and it looks like it happened for alot you lads. I just wanted to say I hope you guys are all ok, and I hope whatever's fucking up your life gets better. Good luck guys, and remember, take care of yourself.
