Just found out I have 4 siblings not 1. My whole childhood I wanted siblings so when my sister was born I was beyond happy. I promise youâ€™ve never seen an 11 year old boy happier than me when I met her. Due to some family drama I havenâ€™t seen her since she was 3; Sheâ€™s my half sister. Itâ€™s been nearly 3 years and iâ€™ve been slowly trying to get back into her life. Today I made a facebook in the hopes of getting some recent pictures of my baby sister. When I looked up my biological father I discovered not only had he divorced my sisters mother but heâ€™d remarried and had another child. His current wife has 2 kids from a previous relationship (I think honestly there is a genuine chance they are my bio fathers as heâ€™s got a history of cheating.). Obviously Iâ€™m shocked to find out iâ€™ve got 3 sisters and a little brother but iâ€™m also extremely happy. I actually reached out to their mom and my bio father for the first time in the hopes of meeting 3 of my siblings. My mom and I always joked I would find out I have more siblings but we thought iâ€™d find out via something like 23 and me. From what I can gather our ages are as such; Me 16 almsot 17, sister A 5 almost 6, little brother 5, Sister B 2, and Sister C almost 1. If youâ€™ve got younger siblings spend time with them even when you donâ€™t want to. You never realize how much youâ€™ll miss doing dumb toddler shit with them until itâ€™s too late.
