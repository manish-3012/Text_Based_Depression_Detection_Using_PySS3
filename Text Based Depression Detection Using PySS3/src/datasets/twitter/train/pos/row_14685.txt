I just wanted to get this out there. Christmas of 2018, the time me and my brother were on the verge of greatness and lost in the end.
Me and my brother said all of 2018 that we wanted an +18 game, and we didnâ€™t tell our parents that it was an +18 game and thought we wouldnâ€™t get it when they found out about the age rating. Skip to Christmas of that year and we actually got the +18 game (they couldnâ€™t see the age rating because a sticker was blocking it), BUT at the last second they saw the age rating of the game and gave it to our older cousins. It felt like I was spat in the face and the hope of finally getting to play an +18 game was ripped in half.
