Why are identity politics such a big deal in first world countries? For example in America many people claim that there is a massive problem with homophobes, transphobes, racists, etc. but when you think about it, many people are very accepting of whoever you are as a person.  

Now there will always be people who are racist and anti-lgbtq+ and what not, but instead of just ostracizing these people why not try and talk to them and come to some sort of understanding so they realize that people are people no matter what race, gender, or whatever they are.  

I understand that not everyone will accept these new  ideas and to those people they deserve the hate they get, but other times some people really donâ€™t know about other races, genders, and sexualities because of the way they were raised. 

Instead of just down right hating them and causing more discourse I believe we should talk and come to an understanding because after all, we are only human.
