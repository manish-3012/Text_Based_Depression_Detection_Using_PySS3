This podcast's mission is to fight the stigma and help any young man who's struggling with depression.

Men: We need to be decisive, confident, persistent and ambitious to fight depression. We need to embrace these character traits in order to open up, talk about mental illness and achieve what we want in life. 
â€‹ 
There has been a shift in western society over the last 10 years towards political correctness, feminism and the supression of masculinity.
â€‹
The media has been feeding young men misinformation by promoting nice guy values. They are causing men to grow up weak and insecure and women unsatisfied.

It is no surprise that rates of depression and anxiety are skyrocketing, 20% of men date 80% of women and approximately 50% of marriages end in divorce.

Men find success through decisiveness, confidence, persistence and ambition.
â€‹
Men are leaders who engage the world with their shoulders back and their head held high.

Men donâ€™t believe in luck they believe in cause and effect.

We need to lead with decisiveness, confidence, persistence and ambition.

Alpha Therapy will always encourage young men to take action and change their life to no longer feel powerless over depression.
