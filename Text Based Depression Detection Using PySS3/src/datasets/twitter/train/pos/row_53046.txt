Iâ€™m feeling a little :/ I think I broke my finger at wrestling practice. 

My parents keep ditching town and leaving me home with like no food. 

I canâ€™t even eat/drink anything today because I have a wrestling match and I need to make weight. 

My dog threw up and I had to clean that.

I have to go back to in person school tomorrow. I have no friends to talk to at lunch so I just sit in my car. 

And I feel like I need to practice my technique for wrestling so Imma just get reps in all day I guess idk
