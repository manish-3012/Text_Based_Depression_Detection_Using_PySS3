Jesus loves you No matter what youâ€™re going through right now and no matter what youâ€™ve done, Jesus loves you. God sent his only son to die a horrible death at the hands of the very people he was sent to save in order to cover our sins. The all-powerful creator of the Universe knows you inside and out and wants a relationship with you. There is no problem to big or too small for Him. The death and Resurrection of His son Jesus gives us the gift of eternal life in heaven after we leave the earth. The only thing we have to do to obtain this gift is accept it. Accept that God sent his son to die for your sins. â€œFor God so loved the world that he sent his one and only son so that whomever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal lifeâ€ -John 3:16
