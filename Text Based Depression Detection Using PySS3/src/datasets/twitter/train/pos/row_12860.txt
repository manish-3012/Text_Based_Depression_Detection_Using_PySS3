I hate people Seriously ffs
Here is some of the world problems we have:
-global warming
-violent crimes
-poverty
-water problems
-unemplowment
-wars
-overconsumptiom and overpopulation
-climate change
-global pandemic
...

And what we care about is skin color for fuck sake why are people so stupid, seriously, do u think being black is a problem now, I didn't know racism was much of a thing, I don't live in usa (no offense) so we don't really see color as a personality or anything, we are all fucking equal for god sake, I don't think I ever heard the word racism in my country as a problem, I only heard it as jokes, cuz it doesn't exist, but seriously, fuck, people now care about skin color Idc what ur skin color is we all are the same, why can't u understand this, I don't believe how much time u would have saved if people were just at least 60iq, but no they are stupid enough to think that color is important (we could've focused on other more important problems instead of skin color, but people are too stupid you just have to protest everyday but people still don't get it, racists will be racist) 

And how about something else
Fun fact: there are 31+ genders
Instead of wasting time on creating new genders on a daily basis to please some people u can invest in research in something that actually is important, like u know 31 genders, I wonder how many of u can name 31 states.

Here read this part from an article
&gt;&gt;"The gender list is intended to serve as a guide for businesses, which can be fined as much as $250,000 for not addressing individuals by their preferred gender pronoun."

So basically u can be fined 250k$ if u don't call someone by what they please, I'm not saying that I hate other genders, I'm saying that it's just a waste of time what u r doing.

Finally, wtf is wrong with teens and being offended, u r offended by literally everything EVERYTHING EVERY..FUCKING..THING 
U can't fucking say a joke without recieve criticizing that are actually serious about ur meme being offensive to homosexual human-offspring aliens or something, just shut up, when I say a joke I don't intend it to ciriticize something, if so I'd say "I hate..", a joke is a joke, and why do u get offended by something that is not any of ur business maybe it's an inside joke or something, and stop calling yourself "activist" and "woke" for posting on twitter '#BLM' go get a job first or something 


Omg I have a different opinion on reddit kill me

Tldr; racism is stupid af, stop creating new genders and spend money on research or something and stop being offended by Everything
