GUYS I FINALLY GOT A GIRLFRIEND AAAHHHHHH!!!!! I canâ€™t believe it. After years of being lonely and crushing on fictional characters I finally found an actual living, 3D flesh and blood person! I canâ€™t wait to see her in person once COVID-19 has died down. I told her I liked her and she said the same, actually it turns out she felt the same for a while! We were on the phone for almost an hour after that! Someone as worthless and useless as me doesnâ€™t deserve someone as great as herâ€¦ but even so I still have this feeling. I didnâ€™t mean to type a lot Iâ€™m just really happy rn. Have a great day everyone!
