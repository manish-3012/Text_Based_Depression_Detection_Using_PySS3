Holy fuck my teachers suck I have a chemistry teacher who absolutely sucks at teaching and gives out a ton of homework and I *just* figured out why.

There's this other teacher that keeps coming into the room telling her what homework to give out and how harshly to grade the papers. And my teacher has been at the school for over *half a decade* - She *knows* how to grade papers. 


Here's some quotes from the conversation:

"You're really not going to give them any homework?"

"just give them this worksheet and have them submit a picture of it"


**LITERALLY** planning busy work right in front of your class. Giving us homework on days where we had none like Friday. What the fuck.

That other teacher is that one diabolical teacher we all have that gets wet from handing out worksheets ffs.
