Teenagers now? really? So I was okay with all those dumb ass adults complaining about wearing a mask, but posting this dumb thing on this subreddit is enough. Maybe you don't see it, bcs it's just in new, but I hate it. (Well you won't see this so it doesn't matter.)

I'm asthmatic, I sometimes choke on just air. I have my respirator on me, bcs I can CHOKE ON AIR.

Some days when I need something from a town I'm taking an 30 minute bus and train ride to this damn city.

And never have I ever struggled to breathe. I believe it's even helping me as I'm allergic to pollen and the less that goes through my nose and mouth the better.

Also I don't have the doctor one, I have a homemade that my mom sew from spare cloth.


#So stop whining and wear it
