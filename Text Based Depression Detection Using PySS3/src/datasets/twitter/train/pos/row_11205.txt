People who donâ€™t read descriptions are idiots IMO I have a listing that promotes myself as Iâ€™m looking for part time jobs because I really, really want to buy that Anna mask.  
  
In the description, I clearly state Iâ€™m not free on Thursdays and Fridays as Thursday is for my free time and Friday is because Iâ€™m out at driving school. And I even stated I donâ€™t take up jobs on the same day.  
  
Itâ€™s Friday. Someone just messaged me, asking me to go down.  
I donâ€™t know, is he brain dead or something?
