I rickrolled my mom I was up after 10 when I was supposed to be asleep and she started lecturing me while I was getting a drink and plugging in my chromebook

She was going on about how I need to be ready before bed and all that stuff, and she goes "you know the rules"

And in that moment, something unleashed from inside of me 

It was the power of *Rick Astley* 

I started singing Never Gonna Give You Up

she wasn't impressed lol

She just said I wasn't funny and I went to bed
