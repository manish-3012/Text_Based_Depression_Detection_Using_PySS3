My school is dumb Our breaks are spread now to help not spread COVID through the schools but if the kids are going to school whatâ€™s stopping them going on vacations. I would do it to where all the breaks are at the end of the year, so kid get out â€œearlyâ€ and if a most likely if it still continues then if would be less kids with COVID.
