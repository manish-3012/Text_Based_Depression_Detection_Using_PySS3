Me and my mom agreed that weâ€™d permanently stay away from each otherâ€™s phone So, recently my mom put a password on her phone, and this kinda pissed me off. Because every time I change my password she makes me tell her it. So Iâ€™m like, tell me your password. She straight up told me no.

So I told her that sheâ€™s not allowed to know my passwords anymore. She said she was my mother. I told her itâ€™s only fair. We argued a bit and eventually she got sick of my bitching and was like 

â€œOkay. I wonâ€™t go in your phone, so donâ€™t go on mine.â€
