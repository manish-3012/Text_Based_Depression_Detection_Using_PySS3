Something that you should know if you are considering getting braces Something that you should know if you are considering getting braces that your orthodontist might not tell you about is that after removing the braces you'll have to wear retainers basically for the rest of your life. If you don't wear it your teeth might shift and become shit again. If you're gonna get braces, don't be an idiot like I was and wear your retainers.
