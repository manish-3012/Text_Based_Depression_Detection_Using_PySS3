Hey can anyone like... give me advice? Because my friends just kinda betrayed me. So I(14F) have been switching friend groups for a while. I am acquantances with ALMOST everyone in my class except one girl who hates me for some reason. I do have 2 best friends and one betrayed me.

So I was a loner till like 5th grade, where I started hanging out with people. I hung out with a group of girls in 6th grade, but then went to hang out with the popular kids for a year and then back to them.

They got a new member the year I didn't hang out with them and It mistly went downhill from there. The member (I'll call K) was being really mean and jealous so she was kicked out of the popular kids group. Then she started hanging out with the unpopular girls and she REALLY hates me for some reason. So she would always complain about me, trash talk everyone behind their backs and so on.

Anyway they told me they didn't like her and we started hanging out. Then I noticed that they only invited me to hang out when she was away or busy. She was on vacation and we hung out a lot. Then when she came back they stopped inviting me because I saw their stories with her and saw them on the street. Turns out that my best friend since kindergarden who told me she'd rather hang out with me than her just started ignoring me because of her and I honestly don't care anymore. I'd rather be alone than a replacement.

Any advice on what to do alone during break?
