guys please read this. i need help so basically on insta i had followed some online friend i made a while back. fast forward a long time and now they're posting rather lewd, gratuitous stuff and i dont even know of it. well, my best and closest friend sees that i'm following her still and now she's sick to her stomach. i dont know how i can get her trust and forgiveness, nor do i know if thats even possible at this point. i'd do anything at this point to reverse both time and the mistake i made of following that person. my week has been terrible and we were gonna call and i was gonna end my week on a high note. unfortunately, god doesnt seem to agree with me and gives me the middle finger when i just want to end my week on a high note.
