ahahaha sleep is so helpful I didn't understand domain/range for trig functions at all yesterday but I get it now \^\_\^ (it's a bit late though since we already had a short quiz in class, but whatever I KNOW NOW. But I feel stupid at the same time because I don't understand how I didn't get it yesterday...it's so clear now T-T)
