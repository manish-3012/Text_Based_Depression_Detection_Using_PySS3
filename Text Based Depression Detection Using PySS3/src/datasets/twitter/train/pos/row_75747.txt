Check out this cool painting I made! Alright now that you're here, we have something serious to discuss. Recently, it has been brought to the attention of the members of r/teenagers that one of the moderators is indeed a MAP (pedophile) based on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kdw7go/uh_oh_uh_oh_uh_oh/). Since we do not have any confirmation for this, it's important to spread awareness and push the moderators to confirm/deny this accusation, and if it is indeed true, remove that moderator from his post.

As a community, we should strive to keep the subreddit as safe as possible. Please spread the message. Thank you.

(PS: If this gets removed, like the linked post, we'll have our answer)
