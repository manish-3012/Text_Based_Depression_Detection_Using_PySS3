Should I get Snapchat? The reason Iâ€™m debating it, is because I hate taking pictures and I have no confidence at all and from what I know about it, thatâ€™s the whole point of Snapchat, but also one of the best ways to talk to your crush other than in person is by Snapchat, atleast from what I hear. Also how does it work?
