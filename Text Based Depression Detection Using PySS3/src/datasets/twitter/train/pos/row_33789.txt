Positive vent I was feeling really stressed out so I went in my backyard, lied down on the grass, played some music, looked up at the stars, and just lived in the moment. Honestly it helped me so much and Iâ€™m feeling just a lot calmer now. It was so great just to look up at the stars, they were so beautiful. I even saw I couple of comets! Anyways I know that there are gonna be some people in the comments saying â€œwho asked?â€ But honestly I donâ€™t care. I just wanted to share this with some people. Much love too all of you ~ ðŸ’–
