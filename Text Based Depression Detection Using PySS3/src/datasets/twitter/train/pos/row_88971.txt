I just indirectly caused a new subreddit to exist, I think you guys would like it So basically, the subreddit is called r/sewious named after u/sewious, the reason can be found in a pinned post on the subreddit, so what happened was I was on r/wholesomememes and I responded to sewious saying â€œr/sewious oh, I thought somebody wouldâ€™ve rushed to make that subâ€ and 20 minutes later it was created, the subreddit is a sub for stories about online friends that people never saw again or just never even heard their name.

Sorry for the long post, I talk a lot
