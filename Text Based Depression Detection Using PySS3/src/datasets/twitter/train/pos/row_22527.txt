It feels like people force themselves to be nice to me I am probably gonna sound like a huge dickhead.
 Iâ€™m 14. Ok so I had cancer in my leg 2 years ago, and I didnâ€™t really have any friends before that. During my chemotherapy everyone kept sending me encouraging messages, but they never spoke to me before that. 
Then when I came back to school, everyone was super nice to me for the first few days, and then treated me the same way as it was before everything. No one would invite me to do anything, or to eat lunch with them or anything. I just had 2 more surgeries last week, and Iâ€™m getting out of hospital on Wednesday. Everyone is always saying stuff like â€œstay strong bruvâ€ and that they miss me, but they didnâ€™t seem to care too much about me when I was there. It upsets me seeing everyone have fun and do stuff. When I ask them why they didnâ€™t ask me if I wanted to join, they would just always up some dumb excuse and say they will next time, but they never do. I think they assume I am not capable of doing anything because of my leg, but Iâ€™m donâ€™t know.
