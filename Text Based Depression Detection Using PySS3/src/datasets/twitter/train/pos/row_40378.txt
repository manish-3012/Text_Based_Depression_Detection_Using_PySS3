unpopular opinion, if blm was really about equality then why are they saying all cops are bad by using an extraordinarily small minority to make their point, isnt that like saying all black people are criminals (they are not) as well as saying all cops are bad this is the reason i dont support blm, because i support actual equality, anyone who says that blm stands for equality and then says defund the police are part of the problem, and what about all the other minorities who are targetted, blm would have been significantly more successful if they werenâ€™t hypocrites and maybe actually knew what equality meant and then to top it all off somehow to stop people having the idea that theyâ€™re criminals they commit arson, theft and various other crimes, isnt that just gonna make the situation worse 

time to lose all my karma, yay...
