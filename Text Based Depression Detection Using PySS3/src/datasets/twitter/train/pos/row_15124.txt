Does anyone else get like this sometimes I struggle from mental health problems so I donâ€™t really know if this is just me, but some days I can be really in the mood to open up about problems Iâ€™m having in order to improve on myself. But as soon as Iâ€™m sitting down with someone I actually struggle being fully honest

I end up downplaying things Iâ€™m thinking and so not a whole lot actually comes out of these talks. So I kinda want to talk bout crap going on but when it comes down to it I just freeze and act like everythingâ€™s going good
