I dont know how long i can do this for. School is a stress that is overwhelmingly intense. My mom is on my ass about everything and no matter how much i try in school, i fail. I fail everything, no matter how much i try. They always say, We dont make it too stressful, so that was a lie. Its too much, its to thr point where im drowing in stress, pity, regret, and have just stopped caring. I cant do it.
