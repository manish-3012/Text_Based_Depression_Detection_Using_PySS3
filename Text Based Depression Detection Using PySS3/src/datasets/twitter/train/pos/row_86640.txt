What do i do? So there's this girl I'm in a relationship in and we are kinda taking things slow (we're both fine with taking it slow) and i have kinda discovered that i really really like her.. I'm in love with this girl and I'm not sure her feelings for me are as strong. I also found out from one of my other friends that she wants the relationship to advance.. with the possibility of naked wrestling and i am so nervous. What do i do?
