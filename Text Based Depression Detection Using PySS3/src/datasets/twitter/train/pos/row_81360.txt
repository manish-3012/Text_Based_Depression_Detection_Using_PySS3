It took a pandemic for schools to prioritise their students and their well-being over curriculum We were told today that we'd be using binders and taking notes so that we didn't have to bring in or pay for books, and it's like, why didn't we do that all along? 


We were told that even worries that seemed absurd will be taken seriously by teachers and that they're always there to support us no matter what, and it's ok to make mistakes, and that they're something to learn from not something to fear, why wasn't that iterated to us before?


We have fairer rules and timetables, which would've been helpful even without the coronavirus.


I'm in a test year, and we were told that it will be laid out differently to reduce unnecessary study, and our futures won't suffer, and yet many students stressed and dreaded going to school and lowered their mental health because of such things, so if this was always possible, why wasn't it done? 


I am grateful that we have these policies in place, and I'm grateful for the things schools were trying to do to better their students wellbeing before the pandemic, but only now are we seeing actual radical changes in the way things are done and,
If our education can withstand this pandemic, then why were schools overcomplicating things in the first place? Surely those issues could've been realised without these trying times?
