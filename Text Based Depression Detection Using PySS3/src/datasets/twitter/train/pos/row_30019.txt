Yo, if u have time, read below Hiii, I have an English assignment for tomorrow: I have to write a short story. Can you tell me if this story is grammatically correct?(For the most expert people: I had Inspiration from BioShock)

Suddenly he found himself in a underwater city, he didn't knew how to escape from this mess but he knew he had to help the stranger that was talking to him though a radio to find an escape. His memories where very blury but he knew how he arrived there: the day before he was in a flight and, suddenly, the plane started flying very low until he found himself in the middle of the ocean, there were only a big lighthouse and he decided to explore it; he went inside of this lighthouse and he remembered why he was in this plane: he was travelling to make a surprise to her daughter that lives in another country.
He knew he had to fight for his freedom as soon as he arrived in this strange city: all the people in there where hostile and didn't want him to escape from their "paradise". He picked up a gun from the floor and made its way though all the mad people and found this stranger, together they escaped.
