My school is led by idiots. Today during our school Zoom meetings, the teachers were telling us about back to school since if you are going to school, it starts Monday, and she was saying that kids will be having mask breaks where teachers encourage the kids to take off all masks for 30 minutes a day. Iâ€™m just having to sit and listen to the stupidity of the school. This break is apart from lunch obviously.

Edit: Yes, this is in small inside classrooms.
