For the 18 years of my existence, I have never had a space I could fully call my own and Iâ€™m angry. Growing up, I shared a room with my siblings and then when I was 11, I was suddenly thrust into a boarding School where I shared a room with 3 other people, again a shared space. Even when I came home for the holidays, I shared a room with not 1 but 2 of my siblings. Then I went to university where I am currently in, and I share a room in the dorm. I am angry because I have never had a space, privacy and just the freedom to enjoy a space/ room all to myself. Idk who to blame but I just know that i need to do something about it. Itâ€™s driving me crazy because I want to know how I would cope, live and grow alone in a space, all to myself without being restricted by the presence of others.
