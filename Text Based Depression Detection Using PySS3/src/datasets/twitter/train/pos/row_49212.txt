A Karen moment I had when I was 12 Me &amp; my 15 yo &amp; 16 yo cousins were at this park at these trails. They've gone there and played on it alot before and the workers always let them so it was fine. Anyways we were swinging and talking and then there was this big slide we all went down. We followed the rules and went down 1 at a time. This older white lady comes on a golf kart and yells "HEY!!!" in the most Karen sounding voice ever. She told us we are too old to play and lemme tell you, there were no other kids there. 0. The other workers said they can play when there aren't any kids on the park which there wasn't. There weren't even people at the trail. Anyways she yells at us to get off of the swing and tells us if she ever sees us on there again, we will be in a lot of trouble. So I had never ever gotten in trouble before with a worker or anything so I was hella mad so I storm over and I ask "why can't we play? We weren't hurting anybody" she says "you have to be 5-12 to play" and I go "I am 12. My cousins are 15 and 16 and the other workers still let them play when there are no kids on the park" she goes "HAHAHA you are not 12. You are a liar. You're like 15." And so I say "excuse me? I'm just tall and have boobs. I am 12. I can bring my cousins over here and you can ask them my age" which I did and guess what they said? They said "she is 12" and she laughed in our face and said "no she isn't. None of your guys are allowed to be on the park, deal with it" and so I say "I AM allowed to be on the park, and ima have me some friends that play with me, which they happen to be teens" but we just walked away and I was being my 12 yo self and I stuck my tongue out at her and then we just walked on the trail and laughed about it.
