I would rather enjoy help. If you are so kind as to provide it. So here's my problem. Last night I was eating popcorn when a piece gets stuck IN MY GUMBS. The stuff that holds your teeth.

It wont get out. I've made my gumbs bleed trying to remove it. I ALLMOST got it out but then my tongue accidentally shoved it back in the hole. 

I've ripped a small part of it off but theres still a lot in there. 

This is the biggest piece of popcorn kernal I've seen. It's super deep in. 

It's back to back on my teeth and my gumbs. 

Anyone got tips for removal?
