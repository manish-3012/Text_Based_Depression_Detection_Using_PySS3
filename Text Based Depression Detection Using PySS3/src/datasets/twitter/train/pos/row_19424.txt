Im here to warn you, please hear me out. Hello,

getting straight to the point

I was searching for friends, you know basic and daily stuff. Hitted upon someone by the nickname of " [**u/MyKittyLolita**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MyKittyLolita/) " asking them for their discord. Since then everything started to get outta hand. Stalking me and not even hiding fact that they are (they as I even doubt they are really a girl.), digging my private info, and even (that one is hella weird) cutting out (or faking a cut, didn't seem rly legit to me) on their arm nickname I used to go by, "owie" and sending me images, after some time of trying to take a logic and understanding approach I understood its too much and blocked em off. They got to join my discord server, after 30 mins I also banned em from the server in order to keep rest of members save. They started inviting many of most active people on my server to her server, where she started straight-up talking shit about me, dropping as many screenshots of our private conversations as possible.

It's as weird/concerning as creepy and repulsive, yall double-check and watchout.
