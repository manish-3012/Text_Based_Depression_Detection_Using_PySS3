I like weird stuff, but there's no other teens to talk about it with. My problem is, it's hard to find other teens to talk about the weird stuff I like to. Ranging from the wild and wacky interests like my interest in strange kinds of v0r3 (censoring it just in case) and platonic BDSM to my more regular interests in candy making and art. I would talk about my programming but I'm so lackluster at it that I feel like people will laugh at me for not practicing enough. Unfortunately, it's hard to find other teens who are alright with talking about the things I like and I'm not keen on being talking to adults about this. If anyone wants to be friends and talk about this kind of stuff, I will give a few warnings like don't use slurs at me (I made a friend but they started slinging slurs at people) and I can be a little overwhelming sometimes.
