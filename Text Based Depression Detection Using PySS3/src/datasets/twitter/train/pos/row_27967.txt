Nobody cares but Iâ€™m gonna vent anywaysâ€” Slowly drifting into insanity while seeing all the threads about symptoms of adhd and me having basically all of them and telling my mom about it but her saying that because I went to psychiatrist for 3 visits and she said nothing was wrong that means itâ€™s all just in my head and Iâ€™m an attention seeking little bitch even tho through these 3 sessions I closed off all my problems and didnâ€™t actually tell the important things and how I actually feel so now Iâ€™m just laying here feeling like a piece of shit that is probably faking everything they do even tho it is psychically hurting at this point because of how much mental issues I most likely have but nobody can tell me that I have them because COVID and also a lot of certain mental illnesses are hard to diagnose in a person who is younger so everyone just assumes Iâ€™m attention seeking and that itâ€™s normal for people my age to attention seek. :)
