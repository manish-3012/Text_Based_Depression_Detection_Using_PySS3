I did my *big* math test today, it's out of 20. There's 5 very long problems. I was on a roll , 100% sure I was getting them all right until I reached the last question. 


That question was worth a lot of marks.

Literally made no sense, didn't finish it in time and also the work I did looks like a horrible mess. I might get like 13/20 or 14/20 . Maybeee 16/20 but I can't be optimistic

Oh well , there's a part two of the test this Thursday.  I wish I did actual exams, even if it's harder and more challenging I'd have at least 2 hours to verify my work over and over again. This test was just 50 minutes
