I literally can't stand my mom anymore I literally can't anymore. She listens to rock music, and I'm okay with that. But when you play that stuff on speakers at full volume, it becomes irritating.

My mom thinks like this: the things she does are the best - which is totally incorrect.

Definitely moving out at 18, 19 or 20.
