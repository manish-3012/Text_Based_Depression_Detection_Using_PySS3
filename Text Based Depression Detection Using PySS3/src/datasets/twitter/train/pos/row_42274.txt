Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck Okay, okay. A few weeks ago, i made a post saying I was suspicious of my dad because I thought he was cheating. The reality of it might be much worse. His business partner is a woman and they text a lot. Iâ€™ve seen him delete text notifications and heâ€™s just acting over all suspicious. Today was the last straw. After we played basketball for a little bit, he talked about how his Dad seemed so much happier with his second wife than his first wife (my grandma) and it made me really suspicious. Iâ€™m kinda having an inner emotional breakdown that Iâ€™m too afraid to talk to my parents about. What should I do?
