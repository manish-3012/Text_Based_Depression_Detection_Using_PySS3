my sister has coronavirus Holy shit. So on Sunday we went for a test and today (Tuesday for those who are dumb) we got the results back. I DONT HAVE IT. BUT SHE DOES. I was ill a week ago but someone from her school got it. So we donâ€™t know where it came from or wether I had it. 

Anyways Iâ€™m getting excited over nothing. This is Britain so we do got it under control (no offence to those in America). Iâ€™m just kinda worried now cus I have to isolate for 2 weeks and do all the online work n stuff. At least when everyone was doing online classes we could still FaceTime and talk during online classes. But now I canâ€™t see any of my friends for weeks.

I also still live with my parents who are both 50 so Iâ€™m a little worried about them. And my grandad comes over quite often so thatâ€™s a big no no from now on. I also have a lot of farm animals. Goats, horses, dogs, cats that I live with and I remember reading animals can get corona too so a little worried about that cus Iâ€™m very close to the goats

I know itâ€™s not much of a post but just kind of wanted to open up to a community that would understand. Not really supposed to tell anyone but oh well. 

Anyways thanks for reading and Iâ€™ll update this post if anything happens

Have a good week and try not to get corona (:
