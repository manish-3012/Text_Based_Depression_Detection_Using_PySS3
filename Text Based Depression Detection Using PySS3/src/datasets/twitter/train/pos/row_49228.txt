President Blubba On BLM 
Reporter: â€œBlubba what do you think about the unrest that is going on in America?â€

Hmmm... I think it is not right. There are riots and people call that â€œpeaceful protestsâ€?! At first I agreed that NO police officer should use excessive force on someone if they are not dangerous. SOME People are using George Floydâ€™s death as an excuse to Burn down there cities, loot and ransack peoples businesses, imagine running a family business for over 10 years, youâ€™ve worked so hard to get to where you are, and the next day you come back to your shop to see that it is in a pile of ashes and debris. I think Celebritys and big companies are saying that they agree with Black Lives Matter just to get more Followers or more people to buy there products. America is turning into a bad place, I hope people can fix it and make as good as it once was. BLM is stupid and disgusting
