my wave of depression is back ever since i went back to school at the start of the month iv just lost all the momentum and happiness and optimism i felt during lockdown. I started talking to a girl at the start of lockdown and we actually went out and even got to making out but she played me and stopped speaking to me. I really liked her and itâ€™s so painful that sheâ€™s gone. On top of that i was homeless for a month, crashing on sofas or in tiny air bnbs all across england and itâ€™s really torn up my mental health. We finally moved into a place but we havenâ€™t got any of our furniture or wifi which leads onto my next thing which is the fact on the 3rd day back at school a girl in my year got corona and i had to be locked down for 2 weeks again. Without wifi i cant do the online work and itâ€™s super stressful considering iâ€™m in A levels now and the work is extremely difficult. Iv been having constant anxiety attacks, i lost all my self confidence and i wake up sad every day. I donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore
