Hey! Imma rant for a bit so do what you want Iâ€™ve been mentally exhausted and Iâ€™m wanting to die Iâ€™ve been losing strength and because school is online itâ€™s really hard to catch up. My grades have taken a hit and Iâ€™ve been doing what I can my dad gets very angry and yells at me and swears heâ€™ll beat me when I turn eighteen and itâ€™s getting harder and harder to keep those thoughts out of my head that maybe everyone would be better off without me, maybe I would be better off without me. My muscles are just starting to get sore and Iâ€™ve not been doing anything strenuous so I think my brain is just falling apart and I donâ€™t know what to do
