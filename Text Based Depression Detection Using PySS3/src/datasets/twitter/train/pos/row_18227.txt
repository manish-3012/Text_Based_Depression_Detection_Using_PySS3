So uh about Mr enter (Kind of a rant)

So remember that screenshot? Well apparently it was taken out of context. But I don't see how it was because the *context* he gives makes it seem like it wasn't actually taken out of context because in his video he shows the full message, and the only thing new was the line: "Ok, but just don't ping me again." And that was it.

Now you might be asking, "Why are you telling us this?" Well everyone is saying mr enter didn't deserve the hate(he kinda got what was coming to him tho)but in [this post](https://twitter.com/armdill/status/1301345250783506432?s=19) , it seems like enter was a bit of a hypocrite with being pinged, blaming the guy who said he was a fan for posting it, calling him out for things he didn't do publicly instead of simply messaging him.

The fan eventually left the discord server in embarrassment because his favorite YouTuber blamed him for things he didn't do. Then the way they act after he leaves is really messed up. But you would have seen this coming a mile away. Why? The dude acts like he knows everything about cartoons and is kind of rude about it.

Before you say Mr Enter is innocent at least read the post. Oh btw, he leaves this part out in the video to make him seem good as well...
