Well its 6 am... I couldn't sleep because I got random thoughts that I had to write down and couldn't focus on thinking about the same thing that I normally do when falling asleep, realized that I had a weeks worth of assignments left to do for 1 class that I needed sleep for, so I just did them now instead of when I wake up (they were due in 18 hours) and now I'm wide awake and have something to do in 4 hours at 10 am and will probably end up accidentally pulling an all nighter for the second time. (Last time I was up for 36 hours and that wasn't fun)
