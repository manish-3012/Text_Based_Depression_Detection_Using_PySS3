Probably won't finish high school Basically online schooling has been an absolute shitshow for me. I can't focus on anything and I can't keep track of my assignments. My grades have just been falling and falling and I'm getting close to failing some of my classes. I did pretty well in the previous three years (I'm a senior) but this is something that I just can't handle. I've already accepted that I should be pragmatic and drop out to save the stress and emotional problems, but I still need some advice.

1. How do I tell my parents? They don't know about my grades or that I'm thinking of leaving. I just keep telling them that it's all okay. They're generally very supportive of me but I'm not sure how they would react to this.
2. What do I do about college admissions? I've applied to five schools so far and I need to know how I can withdraw my application (all of them are through CommonApp).
3. What are my options? I definitely don't want to just drop out and leave it at that. I've heard that some community colleges accept people without a diploma, and there's always a GED, but I'm just not sure about the full scope of what's available and what would be best.

Any input would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
