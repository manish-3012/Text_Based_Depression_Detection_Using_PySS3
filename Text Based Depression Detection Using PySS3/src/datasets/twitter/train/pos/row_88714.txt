If you feel dumb, just remember Somebody on r/Futurama posted and image of Fry that looked like he was doing a poggers face, and they titled it "Fry Pog"

Somebody commented "Fry Porn*"

And then I responded with "pog"

But here's the problem

I

Forgot

The

Freaking

Asterisk

At

The

End

I got downvoted more than the guy who said "Fry porn*" because they thought that I said that Fry porn is poggers

I hate everything
