Today I got stuck in a rocking airplane playground toy A friend and I decided to see if we could both fit in this rocking airplane contraption. The most difficult tactic was getting all 4 of our knees in, as I am slightly taller and there was a bar going across the seat. We tried many tactics (leaning the airplane forward, going knees first, short person first, etc.) and ended up fitting! We were so proud of ourselves, as you can see in the photo below. After posing for the photo, we tried to get out. I had sunken quite a bit into the seat, so I couldnâ€™t slip through out until my friend got out. She couldnâ€™t get out until I moved my knees. Then, realization hit: we were stuck. I filmed the whole thing, and I can see the exact moment where our faces fall and we both mumble, â€œf*ck.â€ To add to our predicament, it was starting to rain and we could hear thunder. There would be a complete downpour within 10 minutes. Fortunately, I saw someone I knew and yelled for them. They and their laughing friends gave me the motivation to violently tug myself out of the seat with all of my might. After a few minutes of sheer thigh torture as I wrenched my upper body and my friend shoved my knees, my legs had slipped under the bar and out of the airplane. We were out! The people I knew promptly left, and my friend and I became stranded at the park in the middle of a storm for the next half hour. Is my spirit crushed? Nah. My confidence lost? Not a chance. The only part of me that felt any pain during this endeavor was my thighs.
