Why do my parents thnks this helps me My parents think taking my phone away will help me be less depressed. It doesn't. And they say I have to spend more time with my siblings. My sister works all the time and when she is home she's a jerk and my little brother and I have nothing in common. I was saving up for a rc car so I can have some fun outside but they said that didn't count becsaue it's "technology". But taking my phone doesn't help cuz that's how I talk to all my friends. A lot of my friends live to far away to just hang out and I dont go to school so I don't see them really ever. I've tried to explain but they say I'm "addicted" to my phone which is annoying because my mom is constantly on it and won't even look up if you talk to her and my dad isint even home so it's not like he sees how much she's on it. It's just very frustrating sometimes.
