Sad news, my kitten I posted about died this morning. So I made a post about [my cat getting kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jp4r8f/holy_fucking_shit_im_getting_kittens_wttff/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 

The first kitten my cat got was already dead. And the other one was completely fine. Until this morning... 

I woke up and everything was normal until I saw the kitten, she was dead. Only a few days old. 

Rest in peace.
