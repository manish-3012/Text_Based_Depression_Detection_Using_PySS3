How do I get over my fear of following people on Instagram? Ok, I get the title is crazy but hear me out.


For some reason, I canâ€™t bring myself to follow any of the popular kids at my school, some of which I like and are actually pretty nice. I donâ€™t know why, I guess Iâ€™m afraid of them laughing at me sending them a follow request? 



I know itâ€™s crazy, but for some reason I canâ€™t get over it. Can anyone help me?
