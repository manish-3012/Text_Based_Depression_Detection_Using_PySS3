Donâ€™t buy dole. When I was in Central America I witnessed what dole does first hand. They cause drought by blocking of water supplies and when the farmers they block canâ€™t make it anymore they have to sell out to them. Where they get none of there profits and get paid way under minimum wage. They are no better then nestle.
