I have finally surpassed my depression If you arenâ€™t t going to read the whole post, I added a tl;dr at the bottom.
  
Itâ€™s kind of hard to quantify when you get over your depression because itâ€™s not like night and day.  Itâ€™s not something that happens overnight obviously.
  
I had been battling depression since probably 6th grade.  It really all started when my friend had introduced me to another guy he knows.  Upon the first minute of meeting me, he had decided to call me a name that basically boiled down to â€œgay animal cock sucker.â€  Being in 6th grade I had probably overreacted since I am an introvert and didnâ€™t have many friends so my confidence was pretty low.  After that, he would call me that every time he would see me and eventually, even my friends had been calling me that.  I felt so alone.  I didnâ€™t talk to anyone, I even sat at my own lunch table.
  
This had lasted continuously until my sophomore year (10th grade).  I didnâ€™t really consider myself as having close friends or anything.
  
I had thought I was depressed, but I always said that there are people out there who have it way worse then me and Iâ€™m just being a wimp.  I didnâ€™t even think I was depressed when I was two seconds away from taking my own life before I had stepped down and decided not to do it.
  
It really only hit me today when I was talking to my friend about his experiences how much my condition had improved.  I donâ€™t really feel sad all the time and I realize that people actually care about me.  And they always have.
  
I donâ€™t really know what the point of this post was going to be but I figured it might help some people to share my story.
  
TL;DR - if you think you are depressed, donâ€™t tell yourself you arenâ€™t and play it off.  Talk to somebody about it.  Hell, you can message me if you want someone to talk to.  People care about you.  Things can always get better no matter how bad your situation.  I understand that mine probably wasnâ€™t the worst, but I know it can get better.
