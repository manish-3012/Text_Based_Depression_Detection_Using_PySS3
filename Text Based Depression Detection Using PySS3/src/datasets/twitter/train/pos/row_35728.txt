This is hard to explain but Iâ€™ll do the best I can So the other day, I went to the grocery store with my mom.

As we got to the parking lot, I noticed a guy who looked like a mix of young James Hetfield and current Robert Trujilo, and made the new mixed person Asian.

If you donâ€™t know who James Hetfield or Robert Trujilo are, theyâ€™re both currently band members of Metallica.
