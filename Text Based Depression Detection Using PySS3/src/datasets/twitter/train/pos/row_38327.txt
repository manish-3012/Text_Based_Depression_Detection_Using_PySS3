I just did the biggest F***â€™up of my life... I plagiarized. On a biology assignment. For context, I am a freshman in a private high school. I had forgotten to do said assignment, and when my parents wanted to see my work I panicked, and choose something online. The teacher found out, which later caused my parents to find out. My dad was angry, and my mom was crying. I myself started to cry. 

I will be meeting with the teacher tomorrow to discuss punishment. In a week, I will meet with someone to test me for mental illness (ADHD, etc).

This happened about an hour ago.

I am in some serious s\*\*\*.
