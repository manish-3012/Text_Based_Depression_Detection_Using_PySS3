Is it just me or is it weird to save pics of youtubers and characters you have a crush on This girl on a discord server im in has sections in her camera roll that are just like 20 pics of different youtubers and movie characters that she thinks are cute. she has like 5 of these sections and she doesnt see how its weird to save so many pics of one person to a dedicated place for them. Oh and this other girl saved a screenshot of this dude she has a crush on whos in her online class. kinda weird ngl.
