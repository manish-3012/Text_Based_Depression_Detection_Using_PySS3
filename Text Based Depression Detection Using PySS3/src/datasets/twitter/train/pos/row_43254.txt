I wasn't muted Okay, so it's not that big of a deal, but I just thought I'd share it.

Back story: Schools here were clowed, but we were not obligated to have our cameras on during online lessons. So, basically everyone had their cameras off. 

So, it all started on an online lesson. It was November 2020 I think. I had a chemistry class and I was kinda bored.

So, I casually start singing the chorus of "Animals" by Maroon 5, because it randomly popped in my head.

And then. The teacher is like: "Um did anyone say anything, I think someone is not muted". Instincts kick in. I immediately look at my mic, realize I'm not muted and immediately mute myself, before the teacher even realized who that was.

I look around, see my phone, grab it and go to the group chat(with my friends, not the entire class. Oh and those friends are also in this class). I start typing 
"OH MY GOD" and before I press send messages start appearing 'screaming' that I wasn't muted and everyone heard me. I'm like "yeah thanks, I knowww"

Anyway, so I insistently asked them to recreate exactly what they heard in hopes of calming myself down, because I was SO embarrassed.

So, after them laughing and laughing and laughing some more, it turns out they didn't here me that much. They actually couldn't make out what I was saying.

In the end, the combination of me not wearing headphones, thus the microphone was not that close to me and the fact that it was early in the morning, so I was sleepy and was somewhat "whispering" - talking silently, resulting in me not being heard that much.

 Well, as much as I would have been heard if I was wearing headphones and it was the end of the day.

Anyway, it's not that tragic, but in the moment it felt really embarrassing. Now, I'm left with a distant memory and a constant reminder of it, when my friends tease about me. They,also, haven't figured out what song I was singing and they will never learn...well, except if they see this post.
