Is it just me or are the differences between older teenagers and younger teenagers/pre teens becoming increasingly visible compared to other generations? Like I'm not even sure how to explain this. I'm 17, turning 18 in a month (let's take 17-19 as older teenagers). I was 13 less than 5 year ago. My brother turns 13 and I swear to god half the shit he and his friends talk about, my friends and I don't understand. I asked my parents and even they said that differences weren't that stark when they were kids between older and younger siblings. 

So is life changing that fast that five years makes such a difference?
