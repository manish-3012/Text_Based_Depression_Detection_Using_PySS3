Should I keep a world map from 2003? I found an old map, and there is still one Sudan on it, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is on it, any some countries are with old flags. It's on my native language and it's like 1.5Ã—2 meters. There is not enough place for it, but I wonder if I should keep it or not
