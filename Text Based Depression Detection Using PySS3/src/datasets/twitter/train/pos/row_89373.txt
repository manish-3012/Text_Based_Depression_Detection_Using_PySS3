Iâ€™m so terrified for college because Iâ€™m scared about meeting people Like everyone at college seems so cool and shit and Iâ€™m intimidated as hell by it. At the same time I donâ€™t want to end up the weird and introverted guy or something but fuck what else am I going to be? Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll be a frat bro or anything.
