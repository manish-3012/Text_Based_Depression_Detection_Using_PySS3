Hey guy, not sure if youâ€™ve heard about Pi: Itâ€™s this new upcoming cryptocurrency, estimated to be worth $200 in about a year and I thought Iâ€™d tell you guys about it. So the point of the app is to mine Pi, while itâ€™s worth nothing, so in the future when itâ€™s worth something, you can sell, or trade it for money I believe. 

So say you mine 300 Pi, while itâ€™s worth nothing. You let that sit for a year and over time it grows to $100, you now have $30,000 worth of Pi. (1 Pi = $100) (300 Pi = $30,000)

Now there is no way of saying that it will gain $200 worth of value but it is free to mine so there is zero risk for possible huge rewards. 

To anyone this means something to: This cryptocurrency is in phase two, so not worth anything but will be soon I think.

If you are interested you need a referral code so hereâ€™s mine and you can invite youâ€™re friends for a boost in mining speed and 1 Pi
(Yes Iâ€™m kind of doing this to get more Pi, but I also wanted you guys to know about this cause I think itâ€™s pretty cool)

My code is â€œcahoyâ€ 

You can just download the app from the app store, it should be the first one there. 

Now as far as I know mods, Iâ€™m not disobeying any subreddit rules and reddit rules. The only advertising rule for reddit is the 10% rule.
