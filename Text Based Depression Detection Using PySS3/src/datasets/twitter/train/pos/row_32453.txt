I hate that i had to learn so much bout being catholic (rant) I hate the fact that i had to learn so much bout bein catholic. Like, im not even chatholic, or christian, i dont believe in any god, so why the fuck do i need that? I dont want to get married, i hate the believe that you cannot sin or you'll go to hell, i hate the fact that the bibal is so stupid, just ugh, everythin bout it is makin me angry. And like, i dont even remember none of the prayers. Like, during christmas, my family was praying while i was just sitting there, not knowin what the fuck to say, just tryin to get by. And during the day of the dead, we were visiting graves and they expected me to say prayers?? Like, bitch, i dont fuckin remember em, and ya know that i only tried to swim trough those dumbass classes. AND i cant use any of that knowlege bout diferent sins or the fuckin bibal anywhere unless its creating characters. :|
