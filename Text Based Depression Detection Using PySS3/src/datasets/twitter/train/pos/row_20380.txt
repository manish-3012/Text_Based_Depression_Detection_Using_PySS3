If anyone ever insults you Pay it no attention, if itâ€™s constantly the same person, either get that person to stop by coming up with a creative comeback or (not likely in succeeding) ask them kindly to stop/ compliment them, they will either be weirded out or change your views about you, either way theyâ€˜re gonna keep some distance for some time.
