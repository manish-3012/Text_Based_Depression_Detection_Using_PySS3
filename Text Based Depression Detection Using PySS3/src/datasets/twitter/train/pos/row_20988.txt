Reason number 846 why band class is great A girl in my band class was talking about a â€˜greek survival houseâ€™ she was building minecraft for a history project, and my band teacher thought she said â€˜grapefruit bible house.â€™ Anyways now everyone in the chat is worshipping the church of citrus. Band class has become even more culty than it already was.
