Be Careful who you talk to Decided to make this post, incase anyone was in a similar situation to me, and isn't sure what to do, or for people who aren't aware how normal creepy people can be.

A year ago or so, I had an account on a site like Yahoo Answers, I commented on someones post, and they messaged me.

Tyler (fake name) seemed really nice at first, even though he was ten years older, but I knew he had a wife, so I wasn't worried.

He would talk about his kids, and his wife, and I would discuss my high school work with him, and that was it. Pretty harmless.

Until, I posted a photo of me, he had seen me before, in something old of mine, but hadn't really made any comments on it.  Tyler was complimenting me, telling me I was so pretty, gorgeous etc. I was a bit uneasy, but I shrugged it off as a friend just giving compliments.

Until his wife and young kids left for a week. He kept mentioning how he was lonely, and wanted me to come visit. (He was only a couple hours away or so.) I told him, I didn't want to, he stopped temporarily.

And then he talked about having sex in his pool, so I kind of told him I wasn't interested in that, and stopped responding to him as much.

Until, he decided to send me a poem, he had written, it was a love letter. I was really creeped out and blocked him.

I don't know what his intentions were, maybe he just wanted to have sex with a minor, or maybe he was a bit more evil than that, I really don't know.

The whole situation was terrifying, because he had seemed so nice when we began talking, so even when you meet someone nice, just be careful.
