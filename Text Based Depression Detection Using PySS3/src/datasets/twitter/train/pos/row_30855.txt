I feel bad Am I the only one who feels bad about trying to make friends with people in vastly different time zones? I feel like Iâ€™m never going to be available if they want to talk, or that weâ€™ll forget about each other due to other complications. For example, if I met someone who lives 10 hours away and really needed someone to talk to, I feel really bad that I wonâ€™t be able to talk with them.
