Thank First Responders Massive respect. To run into a 110 story building that was struck by a jet is on of the bravest things I can think of. When remembering 9/11 donâ€™t just think about the firemen but also police and medics. Take the time to thank your local police or firefighters. Spend a few dollars and drop a case of water at the fire station or police department or just a simple thank you letter.
