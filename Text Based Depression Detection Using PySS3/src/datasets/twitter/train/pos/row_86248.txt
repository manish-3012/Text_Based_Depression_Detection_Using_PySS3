I just want one thing from you [IMPORTANT] Turkish Ministry of Education wants us to  attend exams face to face even though the cases of Covid19 are raising and conditions arent enough to create a face to face exam environment .

We are using **#TurkishStudentsLivesMatter hashtag in twitter to get the attention of Ministry** 

im sorry if im asking for a lot .

Can you all help us by supporting the hashtag on twitter ? we need it. We need it for our health, family members health.

Thank you !!
