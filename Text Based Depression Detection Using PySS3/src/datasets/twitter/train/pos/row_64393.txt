My friends are trying to force me to ask this girl out. My friends are trying to get me to talk to this girl that is my class mate. I barely know her but I kinda like her. They are saying stuff like: "If you have not asked her out before monday morning we will tell her you said you whant to screw her" (I never said that. I jsut aswered their question who I liked the most from our class) and I know they will do it. But I don't have the courage to ask her out. So Im in a bit in a pickle here. What should I do? 

Sorry english is not my first language so im sorry about the typos.
