Drop friends Should I drop a friend because they donâ€™t put effort to talk to me? Iâ€™m probably not in a toxic friendship, but I text or call them, get mad they donâ€™t respond, they respond two days later, and I forget my rage and get happy theyâ€™re talking to me again. Itâ€™s a never ending cycle. Am I getting clingy, and/or is it because they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worth their time.
