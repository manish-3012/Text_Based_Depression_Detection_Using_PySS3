Going to a psychologist should be normal and people shouldn't be ashamed of it! People think that going to a psychologist is weird 'cause you have a mental illness. Almost everyone is like "oh no, do you have to go to a psychologist" and they just look at you like you're a psycho but when we go to a doctor people just say "oh ok" or something like that and they just move on with their day. Mental illness is real and people shouldn't be ashamed 'cause society will look weird at them. 

This'll probably get flooded by the girl that got het car, but the people in new that see this, i hope this helped you
Have a great day!
