I made a game!! Alright so I go to a college (UK college not university for you US people) and I do game design! we just finished our first project and it would mean a lot to me if you could check it out, maybe even try and get on the leaderboard (it's global!)

(it's literally about a bird flying away from penguins, i saw it on a meme lmao)

pls pls pls check it out and comment feedback! It's not bug free or anything and I'm pretty sure a lot of people here could hack it easily so please dont :p

its also not done yet but its sort of near there heh
