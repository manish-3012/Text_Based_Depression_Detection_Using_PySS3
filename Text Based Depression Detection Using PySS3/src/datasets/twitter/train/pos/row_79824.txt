Normalizing obesity is like normalizing not treating cancer Like imagine instead of weight it was cancer. Just listen how dumb the "body positivity" posts sound like

"You go girl, you're as perfect as you are. You don't need any chemotherapy, it's all made up to make you feel worse about yourself"

"Don't do to chemotherapy, you're healthy the way you are"

"Fuck cancerless privilege"

Like do you not see how fucked up that is, but yet one is seen as body positivity*

(I am not talking about ACTUAL body positivity, I'm talking about overweight people who will try to blame every thin person as "fatphobic" because they don't want to move their ass and call it body positivity)
