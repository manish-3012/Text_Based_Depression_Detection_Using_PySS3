My brother is single handedly splitting up my parents marriage Heâ€™s so focused on himself he doesnâ€™t realize what heâ€™s doing to his own family. Heâ€™s addicted to vape, and alcohol, thatâ€™s only as far as I know. He parties all the time, has terrible grades and now the stress and worry for him is getting farther into my parents then it has before. I love my brother but Iâ€™m tired of him screwing up my family and donâ€™t have the emotional capacity to care anymore. This is getting ridiculous, my parents love each other and all of my siblings. Idk what to feel anymore, I might as well be soulless 

Also I have a really big online test tomorrow morning and Iâ€™m supposed to be studying but every bodyâ€™s arguing
