Its 3am rn and I have nothing to do so lets go down my emberassing middle school memories This one time I was putting my hair up in a bun and when I lifted my head up my crush scared me so bad and I- omgg I'm actually laughing so hard rn, it's my second time writing it cause I accidentally woke up my brother with my laugh. I fucking grabbed his neck and I scratched it so bad that it looked ugly.( natural nails, not acrylics) but like why tf did I grab his neck???? Like my first reaction was to grab his neck, omgg that shit left a mark for like a week and he always made fun of me for thatðŸ˜‚
