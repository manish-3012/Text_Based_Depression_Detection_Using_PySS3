Are Women From Porn Ads Real ? Since my younger age, I am used to go in online streaming sites to see series as a lot of people (my dad never wanted to get myself Netflix ðŸ˜” lol). As those sites are not secured and "official", sometimes you can see some porn ads popping up with women private parts exposed. Obviously, I don't pay attention but sometimes it seems like they're fake. I don't know if I am paranoid but when you look closer into their faces, they look like robots. 

And even though they're real, do all of them know they're are exposed on hundred thousand illegal sites ?
