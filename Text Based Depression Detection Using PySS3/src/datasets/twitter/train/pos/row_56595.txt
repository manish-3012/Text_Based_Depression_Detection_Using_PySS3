We all say we want a hug but no one thinks about after. A cute girl hugged me yesterday and its the first time I've felt my emotions in a long time. It gave me the best rush of dopamine I've had in so long. Now it's all I can think about. I really just want a nice long hug from her now. I won't see her for a few days so I don't know how to get my dopamine fox until I can see her.
