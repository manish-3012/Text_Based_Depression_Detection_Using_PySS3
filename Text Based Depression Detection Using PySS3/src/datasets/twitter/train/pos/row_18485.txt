Just spent an hour helping my grandma with her new laptop through video call She is not good with tech-related stuff, but she always calls me when something is up with anyones devices.
So, she retired like 4 months ago but due to covid her retirement gift got delayed untill now.
She got a cool Acer Aspire 3 laptop, some fancy one the company specially put together for her.
She loves it, but wanted to change some stuff on it.
Well, first of all: Charge it.
So i explained that the "black box" is important and what cable has to go where.
After getting it on, i helped her change the language and explained some basic stuff to know.
As you might guess, she didn't really position the camera well, but i am glad i got to help her with everything she wanted to get fixed.
She was happy, I am happy, but also extra tired.
Time to relax a little.

Thank you for listening
