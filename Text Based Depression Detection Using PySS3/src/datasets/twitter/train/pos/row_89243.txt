billie eilish sucks I don't know why, but for some reason during the second math portion of the PSAT today, Bad Guy started playing on repeat in my head. It was actually super distracting and I lost a lot of my focus. I'm worried it may have affected my test score. 

F you, Billie Eyelash, in behalf of myself and all the other individuals whose constitutions you have perniciously affected.
