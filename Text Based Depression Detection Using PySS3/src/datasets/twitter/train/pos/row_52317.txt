CEO Cargo GTA V You know when you are delivering a full load of cargo so many hours of work about to pay off, and a fucking opressor comes by. I had a heart attack, but he dident kill me thank god, but out of nowhere this (forgot the name) A-10 Warthog rams into the opressor killing him, and then shoots meclike 400 meters from dropoff. (I was in that tugboat).

Man F\*\*K Them 11 year olds.
