I am listening to the playlist of songs I associate with my first-love... ... and I'm out of breath. 

But this time, instead of breaking-down, I feel happy. 

Happy, that I've been fortunate enough to exist in the same timeline and dimensional space as him.

I mean, look at the odds... 13.8 billion years of evolution, and 7.7 billion people on our planet, and we happen to exist at the same time.
