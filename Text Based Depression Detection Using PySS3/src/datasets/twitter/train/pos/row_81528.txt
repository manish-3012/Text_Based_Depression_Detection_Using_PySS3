I really hate people that shit on Capitalism Especially in the USA, I see basic 14 year old white girls say like "fuck capitalism", but do you actually want to live in Socialism 

Does anyone in this subreddit actually want the USA to be Socialist 

I'm not from the USA, Im from a country that actually suffered from Socialism a while back and I'm a left leaning person

These white girls just think of "Oh I mean everyone gets free things, it must be perfect" when its litteraly a fucking sect.

My parents had to bow to their leaders, thank them constantly and the government and see them as gods, there was propaganda everywhere, you couldn't leave the country, cool things were bought with dollars (we don't use them, so a very small fraction of people could afford to buy western things)

And not only my country, look at china and russia (while china is WAY WAY worse than Russia in terms of socialism), in china if you have an opinion that's different they will "lead you in the right path", in Russia if you are lgbt you are killed (it's kinda the same in my country still, but whatever) 

Do people want to actually suffer from that, especially the USA which is know to be the most opportunistic fucking country.
