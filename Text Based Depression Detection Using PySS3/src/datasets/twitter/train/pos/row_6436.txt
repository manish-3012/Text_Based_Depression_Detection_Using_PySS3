i hate this so much its midnight and as always im extremely sad and angry

but tomorrow i wont be, so anything i say right now isnt valid at all

which makes me hate myself even more

basically im so sad but i cant talk about it because it wont be true just hours later

or now? i just closed my eyes and im not sad anymore, i think you see what i mean

this sounds pretty unbelieveble but what can i do, im just telling whats happening

i feel like im making this up and making myself believe that im actually like this

this all just goes back to hating myself, great
