So, the whole crush thing didn't go too well I feel a bit shit now. Then again, what was I expected.

Basically, my friend told my crush for me. They did yell it across the classroom and then I started getting stressed. Every girl at my previous school (apart from my bff) hated me like hell when I told them. They wouldn't even look at me without giving me a bitchy look. 

So, back to my current crush. my friend later said something like "it wasn't a joke". My crush cut them off mid sentence and said she didn't care.

I feel like shit now.
