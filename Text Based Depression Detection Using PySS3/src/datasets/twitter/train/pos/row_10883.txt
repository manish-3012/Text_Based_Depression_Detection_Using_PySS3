My mom is putting presents under the tree right now I just woke up (its 2:30 am) and im pretty sure my mom is putting the presents under the tree. I think she was wrapping some gifts too, I can hear wrapping paper shuffling coming from the living room, I am thirsty i want a drink but I dont think I should come out.
