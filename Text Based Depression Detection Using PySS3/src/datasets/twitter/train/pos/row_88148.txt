[alluring and comforting title] Howdy yâ€™all, I just have a few things to say. 

1. Itâ€™s a scary world so remember there is a community that supports and relates to you. 

2. Remember to be better then you were before. 1 second doesnâ€™t make an hour but you can see the time fly. 

3. Expand your hobbies; look out into the world there is so much to learn and do. 

4. I love you, stay safe.
