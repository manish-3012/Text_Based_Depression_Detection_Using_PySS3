So one of my friends tested positive for covid19 And we are in school, so tomorrow our smart principal thought it would be a good idea to get all of my class in school then call the doctors in our school to make the tests this is so god damn annoying i am so angry why the fuck did you divide us then in first place and also our school had this shitty idea of dividing each class in 2 groups and than group A will go to school one week while the other group has to learn online and by learning online i mean reading the same lessions as in books but teacher doesnt explain it you have to learn it yourself you know it takes like 5 clicks to make a zoom meting and just open your camera and the other group that arent in class can learn that aswell.All i wanted to say is that our school is so god damn fucked up and so are we
