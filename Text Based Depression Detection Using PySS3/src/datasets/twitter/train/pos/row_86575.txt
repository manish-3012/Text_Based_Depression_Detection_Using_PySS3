Has anybody been able to quit a social media addiction? Long time lurker, I don't comment very often.  
 

I've found that social media just makes me miserable. I compare myself to other people's amazing bodies and flourishing social lives and it makes me feel shitty. (I know they are a lot of the times fake, but it still hurts anyways.)   


I don't think I am a social media addict but I spend over around 14 hours on instagram a week and I feel like I'm always missing out on something if I'm not online. I know social media can affect your mental health (in both good &amp; bad ways,) has anybody ever quit cold turkey or been able to wean off a social media addiction? What is some good advice?  I am an already pretty lonely person so weaning off the internet sucks because I'm so isolated.  


I know reddit and youtube are a form of social media but personally I don't see reddit or youtube as social media because I don't have any friends on either. So, it's not really the same for me as I don't compare myself to people I know.
