Why only gays ? Why only we have to live in closet due to the homophobic people and society ... I hate not being myself ... Tbf I hate myself ... Like why can't I have a normal life ... Why am I subjected to hate and shame ... Why am I Bullied for a thing I for heaven sake have no control over ... Why is it hard for me to find love ... Why is it that being gay makes me a less of a man ... Why does being gay is killing me slowly ... I wanna be proud and out but it isn't safe to do that ... Or I am just weird ... Hopefully someone out there understands my situation ... I just have hope and ntg else ... Thanks for your time anyway
