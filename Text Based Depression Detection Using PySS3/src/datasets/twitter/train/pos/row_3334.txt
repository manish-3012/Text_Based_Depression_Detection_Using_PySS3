Iâ€™m so done Iâ€™ve been following all the rules, I havenâ€™t complained that much, and most of this has seemed reasonable, But I draw the line at Gretchen Whitmer requiring me to do mr cross country races with a mask on. This is getting ridiculous. I have to race 3.1 miles with a mask on. I need to be able to get as much air as possible, especially since I donâ€™t have a normal lung capacity, and now I have to wear a fucking mask for this shit. Iâ€™m sooooo done.
