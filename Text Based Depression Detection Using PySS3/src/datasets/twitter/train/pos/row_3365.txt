For redditors browsing at night Iâ€™ve found a way to dim the screen even more. (If you have an iPhone) go to settings and go to accessibility, then go to zoom, and under â€˜zoom filterâ€™ then choose low light, and there you go your screen is now even darker. To switch back do the exact same thing, but change the zoom filter to none.
