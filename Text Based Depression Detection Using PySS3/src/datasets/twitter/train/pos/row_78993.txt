Balance of fun (social stuff) and work in ur teens This might jus be dumb but, 

I feel like everyone is either working their ass off in school to work a job(very well paid) they'll hate in a few years with zero friends and social lives..
.or..
do absolutely nothing in school (or maybe just struggling a lot) but have tons of friends and relationships but then end up also doing a job(minimum wage) they hate in a few years...

which one will be happier?
 The one stressing about finances but surrounded by friends and loved ones, or the financially stable one with zero real friends?..
