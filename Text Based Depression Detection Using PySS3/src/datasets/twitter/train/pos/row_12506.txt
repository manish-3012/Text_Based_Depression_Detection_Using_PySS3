If a hemorrhoid came for me last Friday but I've been able to poop since with the help of fiber and vegetables, can I eat chicken and mac and cheese tonight?  I got a hemorrhoid last Friday after straining while pooping (by last Fri, I mean on the 13th.) I was able to eat rice, groundbeef, and broccoli last night and poop it out successfully. I've been drinking fiber water and am overall def feeling better than I was though I need to wipe better back there and ensure that I'm bathing every day in spite of the hemorrhoid and the sickness... my question is, can I eat a little bit of mac and cheese tonight if I'm having fiber and successful bowel movements? Is it too risky? I'll still be eating vegetables I just want to make sure
