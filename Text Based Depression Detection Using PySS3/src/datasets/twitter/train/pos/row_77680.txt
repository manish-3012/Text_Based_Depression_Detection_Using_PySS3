I got accepted into a prestigious school.. Alright Iâ€™m not trying to brag about anything, but I got accepted to the top university in my state... problem is I donâ€™t want to go there, mainly because I donâ€™t want to pay student loans, live far from home, etc. While Iâ€™m perfectly happy going to a smaller school for free (the scholarships cover the cost) one of my parents wonâ€™t take no for answer.

The reason I applied for the good school is because they kept bringing it up, day after day after day, until I finally caved in as Iâ€™m easily intimidated. They made promises such as â€œoh itâ€™s just to see if you can get inâ€ or â€œjust for bragging rightsâ€ and now itâ€™s turned into â€œIâ€™ve paid for you education all your life, you owe me to go thereâ€ and â€œyou donâ€™t know what you want to do, you arenâ€™t grown and you canâ€™t make desicions on your own yetâ€ Theres other things that left more of an impact but thatâ€™s private.

Now Iâ€™ve been manipulated into doing things they want for a long time, but I can understand it, they want me to live a life that they never had. But as I get older I start to realize that this desicion affects my entire career in the future, heck they even picked my major for me.

I have no intention of being crushed by student debt and I donâ€™t think the college you go to matters that much, but itâ€™s hard to say no to someone who 1. Has your bank account linked to them so they can take money out at will (itâ€™s happened before) 2. Knows how to get to me and 3. Just overall doesnâ€™t leave me alone.

Iâ€™m really worried about my situation as I need help filling out things for the school I want which they wonâ€™t pay for anymore, and am incapable of saying no to them. I feel like Iâ€™m taking a step in the right direction by throwing away the physical acceptance letter before they saw it, but now Iâ€™m just scared of what will happen to me if they find out.

Iâ€™m really sorry but I just felt like I had to vent here. Iâ€™ll see how my situation develops, and thank you if you read this far.
