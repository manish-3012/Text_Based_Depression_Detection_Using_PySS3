We need to normalize genital removal. Hey. I'm an agender person, I'm only eighteen but pretty soon I'm going to get my vagina conpleatly removed. This is normal and healthy, it's because of dysphoria. I'm going to be much happier once it's just smooth skin down there. 

A lot of people get super scared when I talk about this. People worry about me too much honestly, I've also gotten a lot of people who are afraid because I diet so I can be skinny and cute. 

But in general almost nobody knows about genital removal (aka nullification) as an option for bottom surgery. It would be a lot of enby people's best option, but there's so little info on it. Both afab and amab people can have it done. 

It's safer then other bottom surgery, and it's really rewarding. The only reason you haven't heard of it is because our society it so afraid of people not fitting into the binary. 

Also trust me, you can still have sex without your genitals. I love fucking girls, and I don't use my disgusting gash for that. 

Seriously. I honestly think a lot of cis folk would get their junk chopped off if they knew what it would be like. Once we outscore reproducing to robots I'm pretty sure people will all have it done at birth.
