The school librarians are so fucking stupid lol So i planned on posting this a couple days before but i forgot. Anyways one day i was in first period and i wanted to test how smart teachers are so i changed my keyboard type from US to DV and told the teacher that my keyboard is not working and i cant unlock my chromebook. I expected him to fix it in 5 mins max but he spent 15 mins on it and still told me to go to the library. I was shocked. But can you guess how long it took the librarians to fix it? 3 hours. Yes u read that right, it took them 3 straight hours to go from DV to US. Dont ever tell me schools are smart. Anyways i did all my work on another computer while they were trying to figure out how to click 4 buttons
