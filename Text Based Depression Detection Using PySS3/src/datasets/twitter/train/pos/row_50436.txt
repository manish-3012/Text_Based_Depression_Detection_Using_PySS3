Its been over a year and i cant move on Its been over a year since i dated this girl, and she was the only thing that made me happy. I was head over heels for her. I was with her for about 5 or 6 months, than she broke up with me... I tried dating other girls, and I just cant get over her, and it hurts so much. Help me.
