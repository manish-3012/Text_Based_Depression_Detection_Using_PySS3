Had the biggest zoom fail the other day My friend always sends whale emojis to me over zoom as a joke, so the other day I responded with â€œur obeseâ€ assuming it would set to private chat automatically. But it sent publicly and my actually overweight calc teacher thought I was talking to him so uhhh

Iâ€™m ready to die cause like he seemed genuinely offended
