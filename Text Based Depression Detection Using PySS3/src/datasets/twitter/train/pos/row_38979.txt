How many of you guys are Game devs? I am practicing game development as a hobby for nearly two years, never made a commercial game (most of my projects are named "Prototype1" or "3D Test" :P)

I personally use Godot, I have used Unity for a year, but after Iv'e switched to Godot I feel much more efficient

Pro tip: make crappy Unity games for school projects for good grades (works for me lmao)

I work Solo, but feel free to DM me if you wanna team up :) , our kind is scarce in these lands...
