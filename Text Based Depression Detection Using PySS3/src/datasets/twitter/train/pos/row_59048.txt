You guys might think I'm dumb but... Can you bring an AK-47 on a plane

I'm dealing with the mafia after my life fell apart so I always keep the good old AK with me and I'm going to make a trade deal with the man of the birbs,
 a trade full of classified items for billions,
what I'm selling; B I R B S. I know it's dangerous, MOM but I'm a big boy with my AK-47 and I need to make money.
so I um... L E G A L L Y sell B I R B S overseas and overair. And also some D R U G S, MOM.
and I have a billion dollar chance here but I need an AK for murder, no witnesses, and safety

(This was a joke and not a copypasta)
