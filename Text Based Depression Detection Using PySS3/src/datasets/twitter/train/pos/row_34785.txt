I GOT A JOB Iâ€™m 16 years old, and I finally got a job!! Itâ€™s not great but it pays 15 dollars an hour so Iâ€™m happy.

My family isnâ€™t exactly wealthy. For the past several months, a lot of our money has been going towards my medication, for which Iâ€™ve been feeling really guilty. I know my pay isnâ€™t going to cover the costs but Iâ€™m so relieved that Iâ€™m finally going to be making money for myself. Itâ€™s like a burden has been lifted from me :)

Thanks you fellow teens, yalls have no idea how much you have helped me over the past year. Happy valentines day! â™¥ï¸
