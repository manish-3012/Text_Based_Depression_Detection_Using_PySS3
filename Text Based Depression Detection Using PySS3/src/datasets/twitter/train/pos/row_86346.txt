fuck sleep all my homies hate sleep so its only about 1 am est rn which really isnâ€™t even that late by my standards but I felt kinda tired so I tried falling asleep and couldnâ€™t and Iâ€™ve come to the following conclusion for why this is the case: my body feels fairly tired and ready for rest, but my brain is still wide awake and filled to the brim w thoughts about random and insignificant shit that makes it so its really hard to ever fall asleep. idk if this is just like an adhd thing or what but even though itâ€™s already 1 am I guess Iâ€™m just gonna stay up
