How do you get out of a tough friendship? Been friends with this guy for a while now. Long story short, he bases his sense of humour off insulting me and other people which I was fine with before and now am not, and I asked him to stop and he won't, so yeah it makes me feel like shit. But I don't want to hurt his feelings by leaving n I dunno what to do, because we do have good moments but this thing in particular just hurts. How do I get out of this?
