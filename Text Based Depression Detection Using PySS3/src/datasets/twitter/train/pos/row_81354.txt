Being tall (6â€™4) is overrated and Iâ€™m sick of it!! Now a days everyone talking about how they wish they were tall but trust me it straight up sucks... 

Like seriously the shit I have to deal with being 6â€™4:

Head is 6 inches taller than shower head

I donâ€™t have any legroom even in my own car!

Shallow girls only interested in tall guys

Getting asked how tall I am

Tons of other stupid shit like sometimes having to bend down for low doorways

Itâ€™s insanely annoying how short people think Iâ€™m lucky. Fuck every single one of those little fucks. Whenâ€™s the last time theyâ€™ve hit their head on branch? Lost hide and seek? Fuck this life. I wish I was short (not like super short but 5â€™10-5â€™11 just so I could live a normal life)
