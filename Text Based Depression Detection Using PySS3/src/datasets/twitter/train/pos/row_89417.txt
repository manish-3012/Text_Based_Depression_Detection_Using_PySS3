Cancel culture disregards human ability for growth A lot of us disagree with cancel culture while not discussing what exactly we hate about it. Should we hold people accountable for past racism, sexism, homophobia or whatever? Yes. Accountability is important. So is atonement. Instead of using their mistakes to educate the people that make mistakes, we persecute them and stifle their chances of growth, and we just weaponize their mistakes and bring it up over and over. Iâ€™m a dark skin gay guy. I donâ€™t care if you said racist or homophobic things four years ago, or even four weeks ago, as long as you are willing to hold yourself accountable, learn, grow, and change your ways.
