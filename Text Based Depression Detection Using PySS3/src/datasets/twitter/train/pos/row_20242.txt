There's so many people on my thread saying that they don't believe circumcision is cruel If you really want to be informed and not just say "how is it cruel" then there's so many reasons you can research and look into and then form an actual informed opinion.

For me personally:
- It makes me insecure about my penis and wish it looked like ones with foreskin intact
- It makes me unconformable in underwear etc, it's sensitive there and some of the loose skin that's left over is almost trying to go up the glans but it can't so it's irritating
- I can't feel much pleasure. My friend with foreskin says it feels amazing to use masturbation toys or have sex, but my description of what I feel is much worse, I can't feel pleasure that way because the skin with cells in it that cause pleasure were all cut off.

I understand my reasoning does not apply to every circumcised guy, and there can be guys with different issues with theirs that I don't experience as well, etc. But can you not understand that forcing circumcision when it's not medically necessary is wrong because it can potentially open up suffering like that? Especially when we consider they're doing it to humans against their will?
