youngest child rant I feel like Iâ€™m just a copied and pasted person of my sisters and parents. Iâ€™m the youngest of three and even the third youngest out of all the family I see the most.

I donâ€™t feel like I have an identity. I donâ€™t feel like I had the chance to explore. When I find myself liking things my sisters and parents like I try to hide it. Sometimes I catch myself having their mannerisms and I fucking hate it. 

I know even for my older siblings it is inevitable to catch some things from our parents themselves. Maybe it could be a good thing that I wasnâ€™t the guinea pig and I get all the good parts?? 

Iâ€™m just lost. Idk who I am.
