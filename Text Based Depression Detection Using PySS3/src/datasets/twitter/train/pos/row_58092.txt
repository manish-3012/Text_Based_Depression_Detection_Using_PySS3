after midnight tonight I will have officially gone a whole year without doing self harm! I've gotten close to a year clean but I've never actually made it to a year clean until now. I feel so proud of myself and I think this is a big step for me. I still have a long way to go but this just proves that I'm at least making progress. This subreddit has been with me since a little bit before this year began, and thank you all for being here. There's been some laughs and wholesome moments. Even if we're all complete strangers and likely won't remember each other after a week of not seeing each other's usernames, it's still a really nice place to be. It's been a long journey through this part of my life and there's still a long way to go, r/teenagers has made that time at least a bit sweeter. Once again, thank you all and I can't wait until midnight!
