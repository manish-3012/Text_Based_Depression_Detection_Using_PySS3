Am i introverted or extroverted? Ive noticed i have some personality inconsistencies
When im around my friends in public my NY accent comes through and im more extroverted.
But when im with my friends not in public im introverted and pretty shy and i don't have my accent.
Then when im alone im just numb i just dont feel anything.
Any ideas of what this means.
