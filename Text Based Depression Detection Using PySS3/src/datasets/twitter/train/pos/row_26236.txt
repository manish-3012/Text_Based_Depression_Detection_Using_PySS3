I seriously fucked up I was sick of masks and I just stopped wearing one. I went to a party yesterday that had 450ish people and I went to school and was joking around without a mask. My test for COVID just came back positive, how and what do I do. My mom doesnâ€™t even know because I deleted the message she got about my test result.
