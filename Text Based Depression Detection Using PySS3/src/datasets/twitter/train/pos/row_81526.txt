this is so fucking embarrassing basically, itâ€™s my birthday today and i didnâ€™t really have anything to do, so this girl i like was like â€œcan i come over? we can watch moviesâ€ and i was like yeah sure but it was going to b late 11-1 am and my mom said yes in the beginning . she took a bus all the way from her place to mine and when she was going upstairs to my apartment my mom started yelling and didnâ€™t let her come and i had to tell the girl i like to leave, and now she isnâ€™t responding to my texts.
