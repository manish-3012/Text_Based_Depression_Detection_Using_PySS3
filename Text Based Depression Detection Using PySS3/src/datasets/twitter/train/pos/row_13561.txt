My emotions hold me back They're my greatest weakness, they can be so strong that i just want to scream.

I aint normal, my emotions aint normal, this is life for me and i dont want to live with it, they consume and eat me from the inside and i cant do anything for the simple reason that they're my emotions, i cant change anything about that and if i could, im probably too stubborn to change them.

I would rather die than live like this, i fear what i am and who i will become, i hate how all my life that nothing has been good.

Ive had terrible education, never cared for my hygiene and weight, im autistic and dont know what i am when it come to my sexuality and gender, my emotions are too strong, i have a hard time talking to people, i hate my big brother, my twin doesn't talk much about his emotions and it feels weird, ive been bullied, have attachment issues and im very lazy

I have no skills so what the point, 18 years for what? What did i get out of those 18 years? What am i doing with my life? I just wish i had the balls to kill myself and that i could do it without wanting to live.

Im so uncertain all the time and i just want to be certain and commit to something.

My life is a joke.
