Adventures from my latest dnd campaign \- We met an unopenable door. Party began punching and kicking the door. We took damage and the door didn't open

\- We met a small elf with anxiety issues

\- We encountered a group of hellhounds. I casted a nat 20 of animal friendship. I befriended the hellhounds. I am now their master. 

\- We found a long tunnel. A party member's first instinct was to scream "PENIS" to measure the echo. 

\- We found an incantation in a language we didn't understand. A party member began singing the opening of "No Good Deed" From wicked. 

\- An enemy was trying to kill us. We asked why he was so mean, and he said "I hate you, and I hate minorities."

\- A party member said they wanted to punch a dog walking by, and the DM said "FIST THE DOG" and began a chant of "FIST THAT DOG"

\- My first reaction to anything was to cry.
