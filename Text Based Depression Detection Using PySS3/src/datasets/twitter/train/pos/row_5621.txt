CAN 

THIS

END

JESUS CHRIST

PLEASE

not the pandemic, just *everything*. i want EVERYTHING to end. it's not quarantine fatigue, I've been feeling like this for almost TWO years now and it's only worsening.

i like beautiful things, people and nature but soon they won't be enough to keep me alive lol
