Day 4 of keeping an online journal I was very depressed so I skipped school and stayed in my room in the dark until my mom yelled at me to do chores and once I was done I went back to laying in bed wishing I wasn't ever born until my mom came back and yelled at me more

I had a dream the night before where me and my brother in law were a lets-play channel on youtube kinda like gamegrumps and we were doing a live show and interacting with the audience but there was this one guy who was very keen on touching me at first it was like a pat on the back and then we was holding my hips and it escalated to him basically groping me and even though I said multiple times to stop he didn't eventually my brother in law noticed and told him to stop and the guy kinda just went back to holding my hips and so my brother in law told him to stop more sternly and the guy backed off and was kinda pissed

I looked behind me seeing most of the crowd and the creepy dude retreating to his seat he was an overweight man with light acne and a beard with brown hair and he was wearing a navy blue shirt with vertical thin white stripes

Today was awful but thanks for reading have more cookies ðŸª
