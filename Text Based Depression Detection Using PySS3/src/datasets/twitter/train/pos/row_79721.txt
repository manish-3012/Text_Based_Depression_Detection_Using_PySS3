My school has turned into a joke After 6 month of inactivity and barely any lecture videos my school just fucking announced that in 7 days they will  start taking online exams at 8 am in the morning, and dumped half of the total syllabus

1. Why tf would they want an exam from us at 8 am early morning when we are giving it from home?!

2. Why tf would they announce it like 7 days ago when in irl schools you used to announce it like 2 months before 

3. Do they really think it will work out just like that? No ones gonna fail and even the lowest marks ones can use google to easily score better marks than the ones who are actually serious, only precautions they took were limited time and that we are not allowed to change tabs which could be easily bypassed by split screen or vm or heck, even by using books or another device, and the only other precautions: parents are requested to supervise, LOL as if anyone's gonna tell their parents about this

Truly a joke which sounds too good to true considering how strict they are with physical exams
