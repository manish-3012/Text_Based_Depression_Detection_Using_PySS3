So basically school just started and i dont know what to do with my life Hi, 2 weeks ago my schoolyear started. I had to choose between french or german as language.

My german is awful so thats why i chose french.
Suprise suprise i suck at french too.

I cant remember a single fucking thing of it and this means i would have to learn 3 years worth of french lessons at school again.

Its impossible but i just dont want to fail this schoolyear, i am doing the highest level of education possible and i made last year with a lot of luck. I dont want to fail because that means i am forced to go to a lower level and then shit starts: lower level education-graduation paper less worth- shitty job with bad pay.

I dont want this but i dont know how to fix my french. My mom calls me out to stop gaming and that i should limit my own screentime but this isnt going to fix my french.

Tbs: i need to get back to my old french level or i will fail.
