As a poor 13 year old how do you think I can prepare for a streaming hobbie I have a xbox one and 15 dollars at the moment and no way of getting money during winter. ( I usually mow grass in the summer) I have always wanted to at least start streaming as a hobby cause it seems fun to entertain pepole and make peoples days better
