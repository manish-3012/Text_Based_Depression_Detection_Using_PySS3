PLEASE WEAR YOUR RETAINER!! I fell into a depressed blob in April when the 'Quarantine Blues' hit me and didn't wear my retainer at all (because self-care is too much effort and I couldn't be bothered), and I had to go get braces again :)

So now I'm adding even more months of braces onto the 34 months I already had..

Please, just wear your retainer..? It'll make things easier in the long run

Thanks,
