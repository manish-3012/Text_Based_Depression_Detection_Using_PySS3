Is highschool seriously that bad? And no I donâ€™t mean the work or being stressed out I mean the bullying and people.

Iâ€™ve noticed that people in middle school (Iâ€™m in 8th grade) keep trying to act like â€œtough and cool ðŸ¥¶ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜Žâ€ to seem like â€œhigh schoolersâ€ but I really doubt highschoolers are like that.

I would understand if freshman were (tried too hard to be cool) because theyâ€™re just getting there and think they have to act all cool to fit in with the upperclassman but then later realize that really no one gives a fuck and that they can just act normal.

Am I right or am I wayyy off?
