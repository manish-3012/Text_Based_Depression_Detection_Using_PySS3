Am I sexist for purposely offending feminists? I'm just wondering, and if I am, I'm planning to change. But is it really sexist to purposely insult women just to offend my friends. There's a girl in my class who claims to be a feminist but is basically just being sexist against us guys, so just to offend her, I would purposely make sexist remarks on her whenever I get the chance. I don't do it any other time, just when she is around.

I'm not planning on changing HER, I'm just trying to add fuel to the fire here, I also like to think that I believe in proper "gender equality" and do speak up when some of my other female friends are being discriminated just because of their gender, but that girl is just bat shit crazy.

Anyways, my question was just, "Am I sexist for making sexist jokes ironically" thank you for your time.
