To all of you, my wish is this: I hope that youâ€™re happy when you look in the mirror I hope that when you crack an egg the yolk lands in the bowl without any of the shards of shell 

And I hope that when you buy pop and chips at the corner store you fish around in your pocket and come up with the exact right combination of nickels and dimes to make change 

And I hope that when you open you always come to the page you left off at 

And I hope that when you look in the mirror you donâ€™t stop to stare at your reflection

LOVE U GUYS u guys r fr the best ðŸ’“ðŸ’“
