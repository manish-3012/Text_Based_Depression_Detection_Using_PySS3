When society rejects you 
When society rejects you, for being slightly different

With its humbling and treasuring billows at hand

Nothing remains which cannot stand

Anything unusual is attacked and considered to be defective

The world grows into dullness, stupifying itself slowly

Whataboutism, anti intellectualism, anti science on the rise, nothing, nothingness, reject the facts to seek out the alternative

The alternative universe that yet does not exist

It is fabricated for those who want to maintain a sense of truth, a lack of cognitive dissonance

So they of course adjust their worldview, and so it is right to them, a post truth society like no other

You watch, horrified, as it all comes undone

They all hate you because you are not the one

You cannot be the one, for you are merely you

You didnâ€™t chose to have this placed on to you

The machine of production hums wearily

Nothing more to hand

There is nothing more to say

All of it has been said

Everything uttered, all for a ruse

Nothing is creative, all isnâ€™t true

Facts are subjective, whatâ€™s right for me might not be for you

We all just put labels on ourselves, to assign unique value

For in a world without value, dehumanizing and systemizing

What else is there to do?

Society has crashed and our brains swirl around without wonder

Thereâ€™s nothing left to ponder for it all has been pondered for you

Oh? Youâ€™re different? Donâ€™t fit in?

We hate you, a quote quite prevalent, ubiquitous perhaps

For change is scary and Iâ€™ll leave it at that

You look around, and you can see it clearly too

What is this place I have found myself anew

You find yourself in answers, in questions which others tell you not to ask

Politics are forbidden, shut yourself up alas

Donâ€™t be different, conform, donâ€™t go astray

Be safe, donâ€™t stray, donâ€™t experiment at all

Retain your homogenous viewpoint of the universe at large

You canâ€™t have conflict, censor your opinions

Nothing is allowed to go against our agenda that we involuntarily chose against you

Oh? You suggested something different? Instantly removed

Go with the flow, the majority always knows right

Donâ€™t question it, accept it without conflict

It will happen regardless, just you wait
