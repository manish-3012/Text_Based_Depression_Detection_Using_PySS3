Does anybody else feel like they do not fit into any groups? Popular,nerds,jocks,artsy kids,theatre kids, I donâ€™t even fit in with the â€œweirdosâ€. I donâ€™t really get most gen z humor or like culture I guess, at least the weirdos are funny. Iâ€™m just a weird boring person. I donâ€™t have any real passions, I dabble a little tiny bit in everything, and by tiny I mean really really tiny like itâ€™s not a good thing. Of course I have my own niche video games, tv shows I watch and am really into but itâ€™s few and far between, so itâ€™s pretty hard to find people with the same interests. Itâ€™d be cool to be able to manage a friendship long enough that we start exploring new interests with each other, but it never gets to that point.
