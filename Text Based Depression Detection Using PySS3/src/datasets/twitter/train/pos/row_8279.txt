I just caught giratina after 7 years ik nobody played pokÃ©mon platinum but I got this game when I was SEVEN YEARS OLD, and after picking my 3ds up again after a couple months (last time I did that I beat the elite 4) and I went to Turnback Cave and caught giratina, after failing the first attempt around 6 years ago.
