MODS GAY **Never before has the destiny of so many be determined by so few.** Yesterday marks the darkest chapter in r/teenagers, **multiple recognizable faces such as Megathicc has been banned of r/teenagers by mods** and among many other. They even go as far as to taunt on people who have been permanently banned.


The shadow of uncompromising tyranny have been casted over the good people of r/teenagers. It is in our god given duty as a community to overthrow the evil shadows that overrules and taunts us. We shall fight this tyranny once and for all. We shall fight in the comments, we shall fight in the posts, we shall fight in the dms and message and we shall never surrender.
