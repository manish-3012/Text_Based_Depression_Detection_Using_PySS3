Confused about what gender is I keep hearing it thrown around and when I asked my friends about it they said it's what your identification is. So I asked them to elaborate and they said for example imagine being a boy but you have the mind of a girl or want to be one, then your sex would be male but your gender would be female. I'm still really confused can someone please explain this?
