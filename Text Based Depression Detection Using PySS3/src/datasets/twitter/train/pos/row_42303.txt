finally left a toxic friend, but... iâ€™m not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on, but i am a teen and toxic friendships are (i think) a common issue in many teens. or maybe i just have horrible luck. anyways, itâ€™s a really, really long story, but i just barely got out of an extremely toxic and manipulative friendship that had me crying myself to sleep and hyperventilating all the time. they have many mental health struggles (as do i but they have it way worse) and i was always too scared to leave them as i was worried they would do something scary and it would be my fault. so i stayed, and i tried to be there for them. but it just became so much and they always blamed everything on me. i wouldnâ€™t be allowed to say that i had my own mental struggles and that i wasnâ€™t in the right headspace to listen to them. they always played the victim. and i had had enough, so i finally left them, blocked them everywhere. but it wasnâ€™t easy, because up until i blocked them they were still saying so many mean things to me and wouldnâ€™t let me leave. but i did. and i thought i would be happy, but now iâ€™m so afraid that in the future, theyâ€™ll come back and try to ruin my life by spreading lies about me. iâ€™m up late at night because iâ€™m so anxious and afraid. iâ€™ve saved screenshots of the mean things theyâ€™d said to me, but still. nobody knows the whole context except us/me. i would really like advice.
