today is the 4th anniversary of my great-grandfather's death I'm honestly not sad, he led a fulfilling life until age 97. He was a major source of inspiration for me and still is. I hope he is resting well. For all my fellow teenagers, please take the time today to share love with your family. They won't be there forever.
