Cat just gave me a stroke I just had to move my cat to vacuum my hall (he's deaf, can't hear the vacuum so it doesn't scare him) and he was asleep, so I pick him up and he wakes up and just stays limp in my arms and I put him on my bed and he just flops there idk man it was just so damn cute dudnbshs
