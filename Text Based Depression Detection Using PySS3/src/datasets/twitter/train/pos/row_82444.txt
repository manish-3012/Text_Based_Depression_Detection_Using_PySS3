Yâ€™all think itâ€™s aight to reach out to a former teacher? I had this teacher my sophomore and junior years of highschool that I would have long discussions with and Iâ€™ve been really wanting to reach out to her. Iâ€™m sure itâ€™d be fine but part of me feels like maybe itâ€™s weird for a student to reach out because Iâ€™ve never heard of anyone else doing so. Can anyone think of a reason why you shouldnâ€™t?
