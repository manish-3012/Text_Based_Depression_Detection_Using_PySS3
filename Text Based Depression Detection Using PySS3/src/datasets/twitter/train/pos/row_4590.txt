I want to call the hotline but I'm terrified I need something to hold on to right now. I don't know if I'll commit suicide tonight, but even if I don't I'm just going to sit in bed here all night, alone and suffering.

I've only ever tried to call the hotline once before, where I had the number dialed but I hung up last second because I'm so scared of talking to people. I don't know if I'm able to even talk right now.

I know this isn't the place to go right now but I feel like a failure and I can't stop crying, I just need someone to tell me something encouraging. I really want to hear something, anything. I could contact my friends but it's two in the morning, I don't want to bother them. I don't want to bother anyone. If I call in will it be a waste of resources? Is there even a point?
