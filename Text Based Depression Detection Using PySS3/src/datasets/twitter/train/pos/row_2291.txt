Hey you! Yeah, you there, browsing Reddit at 2 AM eating cherry Pop-Tarts in quantities not meant for human consumption! You like music? I certainly do. In fact, I like music so much, I feel the need to tell everyone about it even though they really don't give a shit! Isn't that amazing? We can tell each other what music we like, and we can not care about either's preferences! Man, mutual ambivalence sure is great! I'll go first!
