Confused af 17F 18M so I know her for a year and I confessed to her out of a sudden. She has a crush on me for a long time but I didnâ€™t know. She then asked me about our relationship and I said couple so we dated for a month and a half. We introduced each other to our family and friends so u can see the seriousness. She then told me she isnâ€™t emotionally prepared for the relationship and asked if we could be close friends first. I asked if she wanted to break up but she said only a break. I realized she wanted to take things slowly so I ainâ€™t forcing her. Like everything came in a sudden. I donâ€™t think we were both ready. We know each other for a year but we didnâ€™t know each other that well before. She said we could try again in the future. I just got into uni and shes about to get into uni and we are both stressed. We have feelings for each other but the timing is bad. I really like her. I donâ€™t know what to do.
