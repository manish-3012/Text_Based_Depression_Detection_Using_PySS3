Releasing a song So Iâ€™m premiering a song in 10 mins on YouTube and Iâ€™m kinda nervous even though I know the only person watching it will be me, because I have 6 subscribers lol. Iâ€™ve kinda accepted the fact that no one will be there but I just really want someone else to. Thatâ€™s all I really have to say. 
(If you want to watch my channels called Ingo and the song is The Skies) Iâ€™m not trying to promote myself Iâ€™m just saying what I feel rn.
