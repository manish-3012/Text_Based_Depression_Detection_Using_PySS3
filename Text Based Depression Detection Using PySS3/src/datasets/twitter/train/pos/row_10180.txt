After testing both sides, I can confirm that girls are way more complicated in terms of dating and whatnot Allow me to explain. Iâ€™m a 16 year old dude and I came out as bisexual in eighth grade. Iâ€™ve dated two females and one male since then (currently single). Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned.

*Boys*
Boys are dumb. Thereâ€™s no getting around that lol. While itâ€™s true that there are quite a bit of smart dudes out there, theyâ€™re all dumb. We canâ€™t take hints for the life of us, so itâ€™s much better to be blunt if youâ€™re hitting on a guy. Itâ€™ll go much better if you do.

Maybe itâ€™s just me and my ex-bf, but I picked up the vibe that guys typically find excessive clinging a turn off. I mean, we love commitment and dedication, but I personally find it a little annoying if someone is constantly trying to go on dates (by which I mean all day every day). Maybe this is a no brained but I put it on here anyway.

Guys love cuddling almost as much as girls. Non sexual physical contact for excessive periods of time feels absolutely amazing for us. Itâ€™s an amazing feeling, as itâ€™s intimate yet friendly at the same time.

*Girls*
Girls are usually dedicated almost to a fault. Having a gf is a huge responsibility. I donâ€™t mean to degrade women at all by this, but having a gf can be compared to having a pet. They require quite a bit of attention, but they more than reciprocate if you meet their needs. Itâ€™s tiring but wonderful at the same time. Worth every minute

Girls take breakups pretty hard. Even if the breakup is for a logical reason such as distance or different values, they seem to always take it personally. Itâ€™s super hard to convey thoughts and emotions, especially as a teen, so make sure youâ€™re extra careful around women.

Anyway thatâ€™s it. Enjoy :)
