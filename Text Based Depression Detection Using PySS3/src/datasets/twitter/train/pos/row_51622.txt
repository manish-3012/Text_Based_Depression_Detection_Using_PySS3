Continuation to my previous post (Realization) I didnâ€™t get the chance to ask about her phone number sadly I think she left today and itâ€™s probably true that I wonâ€™t see her for a good while once again. For most of the day I just felt a huge bucket of regret and I donâ€™t really know how to deal with it. Before I wasnâ€™t sure if I liked her but after how my school year (love life wise) went before Covid I guess I actually do have strong feelings for her. The one day I did go to see her I felt happy, a feeling thatâ€™s really rare to me. Havenâ€™t really had feelings like this for someone in a long time and for me to mess it up that easily kinda hurts in a way. I donâ€™t know if she got a special someone or not but I still find myself thinking about her. Part of me wants to ask my mom but at the same time I donâ€™t really know how, Iâ€™ve never really went to my mom about these types of things. Sorry for this post I just wanted to tell someone, because if i told anyone else Iâ€™d feel like an embarrassment.
