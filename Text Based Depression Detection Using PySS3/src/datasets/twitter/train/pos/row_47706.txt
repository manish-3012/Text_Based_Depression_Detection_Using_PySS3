Unviable political ideologies I  see a lot of nonsense being pushed, people offering you false solutions  that doesn't hold up to scrutiny "real communism has never been tried".

**Libertarianism**

If  there isn't sufficient social control society will collapse and a new  society will emerge, this may or may not be a good thing but in any case  you cannot avoid totalitarian social control.

Free capitalism would simply result in one single company grabbing taking  over (buying politicians, media, etc) and that is the end off free  capitalism.

**Communism**

A central governing body by humans will not be able to by themselves make all decisions, thus if you make the government too big things will begin to fail.

It is possible that we could solve this issue with artificial intelligence (making full totalitarianism viable) but currently we do need capitalism to a degree. 

**Ethno-nationalism**

That seemed to work out initially with Hitler but we all know how that ended.  By excluding ethnicity you weaken society, you lose out on people who could have been very valuable for your society.

This is also true for ideologies that exclude people based on gender expression, sex characteristics, sexual orientation or anything else that is not relevant in terms of actually building a strong functional society.
