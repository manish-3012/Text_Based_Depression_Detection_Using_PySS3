I absolutely despise my parents. I just need a place to rant, my parents are terrible people. Every time I do anything wrong to in their opinion they don't ever level with me and just yell. I haven't received a single compliment in ages from them and every time a bad grade rolls in they just harass me about which stresses me out more and makes me get worse grades. They treat me like I'm 5 years younger than I am and don't ever allow me to do anything that they consider "dark", "dangerous" or "in bad taste". The moment I hit 18 I'm out of here, even if I have to swamp myself in student debt.
