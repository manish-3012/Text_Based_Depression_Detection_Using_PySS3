I need help with my life Hi, I'm a junior at a highschool in a very small town. I played football my freshman year and couldn't continue playing for my sophomore or junior year due to family issues. My parents weren't able to drive me too and from practice because of their schedules. This year I'll be able to get my driver's license, but to be added to insurance I'll have to pay 200 something dollars every month because I'm a liability. 

Because my town's small there aren't many jobs open, and even less with a schedule that would allow me to play football. It's down right competitive when you're trying to get a job. 

So I think you see my predicament here. 1) I wanna play football my last year of highschool so I don't regret not playing. 2) I don't have a way to get to and from practice other than me driving that I know of. 3) me driving would cost me two hundo a month in insurance. 4) to get a job in my area I'd have to sacrifice the time I'd use training in football to make the money to get to football.

Thank you for reading

I can't think of anything I can do so if you have any ideas please tell me.
