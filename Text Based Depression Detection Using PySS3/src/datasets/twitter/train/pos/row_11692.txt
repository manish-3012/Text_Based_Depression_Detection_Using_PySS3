I donâ€™t know what to do with my life I feel my motivation slowly slipping away from me. I no longer feel enjoyment from what I usually find comfort in. Iâ€™ve lost touch with friends, hurt relationships with family, and started to slip on school work.

I guess what Iâ€™m wondering is if anyone has gone through something similar and what they did to get out of that dark place.
