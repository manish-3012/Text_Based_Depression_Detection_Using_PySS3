This is controversial but imma put this out there. A white person saying the n word with the a (as long as theyâ€™re not saying it to insult a person due to their race) isnâ€™t racist.

Should they say it? Probably not because not only will it just create problems for them, but also show respect for those that take offense to the word.

Iâ€™m also white so idk how much of an opinion I have here but if youâ€™re singing a song I really donâ€™t see a problem with it. Again unless youâ€™re around someone that would take offense to it.
