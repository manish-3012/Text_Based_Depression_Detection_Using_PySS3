Hi Fellow Teens.. I deleted Instagram and it was hard..
First things first, Yes I know Instagram..
All my friends have it and I wanted to fit in and now..
I noticed that Instagram Started showing me stuff like politics and Other things and Somethings that are super sketch...
Iâ€™m Finished with it, It only brought me closer to
Depression and I switched schools and lost all my friends...
But now, I feel a lot better that I donâ€™t have to worry about that crap anymore....
If you have it, Delete it!
Itâ€™s only purpose is to keep you hooked and not to Provide to your interests...
Trust me, you will feel better...
