Last night i had a dream And it was the best dream i've ever had. 

So i moved with my family to a new house and near the house was a beautiful forest. It was like late summer and me and my brother planed to explore that forest. Sad part is - i dont actually have a brother. It always made me sad but at the same time i had opportunity to experience what is it like having a brother, even if its just a dream. And we were there, exploring the forest together, it was nice. Then i woke up and wanted to cry because i dont have a brother and because im lonely piece of shit.
