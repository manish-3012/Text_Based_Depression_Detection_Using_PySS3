I have figured out why no one in Chicago knows how to drive I made a bumper sticker that was meant to be a play on the student driver stickers. The ones that say â€œBe patients Student driverâ€ except I changed â€œstudent driverâ€ and I posted it on r/Chicago and no one understood what it was. They thought I was saying Chicago drivers are patient, now it all makes sense, they never took a drivers ed course. Also like the only requirement to get a license in Chicago is that you need to have proof that you lived there more than one year.
