Im stuck Just a warning in advance this is pretty gruesome. Itâ€™s true btw

Right now my school bus is in a traffic jam and there are about 25 ambulances 6 fire trucks and around 40 police cars

All I can see from my window is a big tarp and a few firemen spraying blood off the road. 

Sorry this is short itâ€™s just itâ€™s a bit load on the bus from all the kids talking
