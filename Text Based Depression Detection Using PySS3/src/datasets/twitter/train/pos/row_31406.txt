Okay so I want to find someone's reddit account but I don't think I'm going to try anymore because that seems like an invasion of privacy I know I'm not going to do it anymore because its a inorganic way of knowing what someone is like but I'm starting to feel like I'm just a burden again and I force people to talk to me even though they don't want to really and I would like some reassurance that it's not true but I can't really say that cuz how fucking needy is that but its okay I just need to eat some lunch and drink some water
