The Voice and The String: a poem that doesnâ€™t rhyme, cause thatâ€™s what cool people do right? Iâ€™ve been inside too long.
I put on my nice warm hoodie. It feels like a blanket.
I put on my jeans, and my shoes. I like my look.
I go out of the house. Itâ€™s a nice cool dusk. Iâ€™m still warm in my hoodie.
Iâ€™m calmed by the quiet twilight.
I walk down the street, not really making eye contact, just thinking away to myself.
Thinking about what people think of me.
Down the street I still walk, till I see a face.
A few faces. Familiar faces.
Those are my friends. I know some of them.
They shout my name, and I give a muted, unenthusiastic reply.
I donâ€™t want to annoy people nearby.
What will they think of me?
The face that Iâ€™m closest to walk towards me.
They try to strike up a conversation. I really want to too.
But I canâ€™t.
A string tugs at my back, pulling me away
A voice whispers in my ear,
â€œBe careful what you say,
Choose your words carefully.
What do they think of you?â€
I pull against the string, I block out the voice.
The faces want to talk to me and I want to talk to them.
But still that voice prevails,
â€œThey donâ€™t want you there.
 Theyâ€™re only here out of pity.
Thatâ€™s what they think of you.â€
I know the voice lies. Iâ€™m not stupid.
But I listen nonetheless.
I say little to the faces, Iâ€™m too focused on the voice and the string.
The faces say goodbye awkwardly.
â€œThey think youâ€™re weird.
You ruined the conversation.
They wonâ€™t want to talk to you.
Thatâ€™s what they think of you.â€
I walk away, following the string like a tired dog on a leash.
Iâ€™ve succumbed to the string, but the voice keeps pestering me,
â€œYou are such a leech.
Why do you want to be with them so badly?
They think youâ€™re weird.
Thatâ€™s what they think of you.â€
I sigh to myself and believe it.
Thatâ€™s what they think of me.
