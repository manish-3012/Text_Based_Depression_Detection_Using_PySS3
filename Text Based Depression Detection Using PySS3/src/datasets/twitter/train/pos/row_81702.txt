I don't like my parents My parents don't give me enough space. 

They're always in my business. I KNOW I FAILED THAT ASSESSMENT, I WAS THE ONE WHO TOOK IT, AND THEY PROCEED TO TELL ME THE SAME THING EVERYDAY. 

not to mention my parents limit me to 7 hours a week on TV, so I don't get addicted, but like what the fuck??? You're making it more valuable than it actually is!!! 

I can hardly take naps in my house too. 

The most irritating thing is the favoritism of my brother. I just hate it so much. When I brought it up to my dad he made me cut off my crush. Like you think taking a person I care for away from me is gonna make me think my brother isn't preferred to me?

My parents aren't terrible by any means, I just don't like them, and they frustrate me a lot.
