ok this is my dad's story of a madlad ok this is my dad's story

so when he was at work

everyday

there was a dog

a weaner doggo

his name was Fred

and Fred was awesome

but then

Fred stole my dad's croissant

and then he went from cool Fred

to Fred the croissant stealing badass

that was like 10 years ago

he was 11 when he stole that Croissant

my guess is he went to heaven and stole another croissant

Fred The Croissant Stealing Badass

you will be missed
