To Lucy: Fuck You, and Thank You Yesterday I decided that I want to change my life. I want to achieve greatness in life, but I want to start off by achieving greatness in school. 

What caused this epiphany? Well, basically I was told that I am likely to not be very successful. Iâ€™ve always thought highly of myself, more highly than others. Iâ€™ve always been told by my father that I can do whatever I want, and I believed him. I think he is right, but left out a very important detail: You only get out what you put in.

I read that [those who stay up later are usually smarter](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.entrepreneur.com/amphtml/292961), so I set my bedtime for 1:30 am every night. I will wake up at 8, go to school, finish school at 3:30, go to sleep again for half an hour or so, then have a shower. The rest of the day would be free time for schoolwork and hustling.

It is currently around 1am. Iâ€™m going to go to sleep in half an hour and start my new life from the moment I wake up. Iâ€™m going to actually listen in class from now on. Iâ€™m going to get the best grades in my class, even though my class has one of the smartest girls in the year. Iâ€™m going to become one of the smartest girls in the year, even though Iâ€™m a guy. 

I have one big fear... a fear of failure. I know fear is good, it keeps us on edge and helps us to achieve greatness, but sometimes it is very overwhelming. 

If you for whatever reason are reading this, Lucy, then fuck you for being so rude to me, but thank you for opening my eyes.
