Relationships are pointless before the age of 18 Idk why yâ€™all get so into relationships before 18. The way I see it most relationships before the age of 18 age are full of shit and a joke. I wonâ€™t let my heart be broken and get anxiety again because of some lame ass high school relationship I donâ€™t play that shit.
