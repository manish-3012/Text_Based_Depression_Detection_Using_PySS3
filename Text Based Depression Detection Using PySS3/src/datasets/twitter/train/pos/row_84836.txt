I have a scar from a mosquito bite on my calf This makes me really sad guys. I canâ€™t not wear thigh highs without looking sexy and get all boys to fantasize over me... I deserve that. This one time my e-boy crush on the internet made me cry in my closet after I told him through a call that I loved him, and I almost cried for 116 minutes. I dyed my black hair a dark brown color and my republican dad scolded me for being too much of a zoomer. Also, this one time, a mean bully in fourth grade called me a little b*itch when I tripped..
