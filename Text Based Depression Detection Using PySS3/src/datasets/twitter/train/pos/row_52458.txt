New girl I added her 2 week ago on snap bc I thought she was cute, she added me back two days ago and I realized weâ€™re basically neighbors bc of snapmap. Really enjoyed talking to her day 1 and yesterday when I pointed out that we were close together she said â€œcoolâ€ not the same energy that I got. Just been on delivered all day today. I ended my streaks with people because I didnâ€™t talk to them but then the people I want to talk donâ€™t reciprocate.
