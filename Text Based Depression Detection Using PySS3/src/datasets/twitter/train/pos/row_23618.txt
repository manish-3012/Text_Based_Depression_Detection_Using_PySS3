First home Im nearly 19 and moving into my own home soon , itâ€™s my first time living my self and I donâ€™t have a job due to the pandemic. Wasnâ€™t long ago I realised holy fuck thereâ€™s so much you need to buy - kettle, toaster, microwave, fridge, freezer, iron, hoover and so on and on and on. Itâ€™s a real eye opener and thatâ€™s just the ESSENTIALS off the top of my head thereâ€™s hundreds you need to buy but tbh I just want a couch, coffee table and tv in my living room and a bed in my bedroom easy as that but itâ€™s all the stuff you need everyday the essentials. Thereâ€™s also paint, gloss, carpet and laminate. Has anyone got any advice like life hacks or whatâ€™s necessary day to day
