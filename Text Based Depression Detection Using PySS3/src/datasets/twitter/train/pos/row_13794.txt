Does anyone else feel this deep in their bones? I don't know what it is, but I feel like I'm going to die soon. Not by suicide or anything, I would never do that...but I still have this knot in my stomach and I just know I don't have long on this earth. Does anyone else feel this? Like it's bad though. I've had depression and I've overcame it, but I swear to God I'm going to die soon in some freak accident.
