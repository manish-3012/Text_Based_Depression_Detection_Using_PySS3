For all the foreigners Iâ€™m going to explain how to make a biscuit Basically place even layer of cold butter over dough about 3/4 inch (19mm) thick, than fold it over a few times, flatten it out to about 1/4 inch thick and bake it

Now you have a delicious buttery flaky biscuit packed with carbs, enjoy. If it doesnâ€™t sound delicious you should try it, I promise itâ€™s better than it sounds
