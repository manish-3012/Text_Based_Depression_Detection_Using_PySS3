iâ€™m gonna cry i have to go back to in person school in like two days please fucking kill me already i canâ€™t believe i was looking forward to this what the fuck i wanna stay home forever

i forgot how awful it was at school and how i had like no friends and no one talked to me and i was lonely all the damn time 

i always felt like everyone was judging me but honestly they probably werenâ€™t because i didnâ€™t even know anyone even though iâ€™ve lived in the same town for my whole life i know probably like a third of my grade

also iâ€™m pretty sure everyone who did know who i was has completely forgotten me by now, no one talked to me over quarantine even once and people still donâ€™t talk to me now except if they fucking want something.

iâ€™d rather be peopleâ€™s second choice because then iâ€™d actually be a choice instead of irrelevant
