Got tested today Today I got a covid test, the nurse swabbed my nose with a Q-tip for about 10 seconds, then I just had a check-up with another nurse, who I had when I was little, pretty neat seeing her again after 7 or so years, anyways, I haven't gotten the test results back yet, but hopefully I test negative, will update soon with the results.
