Iâ€™m not understanding. Why do SO many fucking parents think that emotionally neglecting their child is a good thing and will make their child sTrOngâ€ and â€œASsEeRTiVEâ€. Youâ€™ve literally forced me into anxious situations since I was 6, and Iâ€™m still not â€œsToNe cOlDâ€ like you want me to be. Iâ€™m just as sensitive before. All you did was traumatize me dumbass.
