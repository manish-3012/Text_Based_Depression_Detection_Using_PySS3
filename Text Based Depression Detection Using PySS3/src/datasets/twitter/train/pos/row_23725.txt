Thoughts on dating through Discord? So a few weeks ago one of my friends said they liked me and I liked them back. Every since we have been dating. Turns out at the end of the school year she moves an hour and a halfâ€™s drive away. We still want to make it work and thought that we could use Discord and visit sometimes during the summer. We met on Discord when a friend introduced us and we were entirely online friends for a year and then when we met in person we realized that we liked each other. So, what is your opinion on dating mostly through discord? Do you think it will work (especially if we visit once or twice person year?) do you think sheâ€™ll cheat on me? Iâ€™m stressed and really sad so any help is very much welcomed.
