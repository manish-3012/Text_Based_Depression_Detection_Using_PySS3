I almost accidentally convinced my mom to get matching tattoos Okay so getting a tattoo is forbidden in my religion, but my mom once got one when she was about my age, maybe a little older. It's nothing much, just the M from my name.

But we've been watching Supernatural for a while now, and I've made the joke of getting the anti possession tattoo together and she always just laughed and was like "shut up"

A few days ago she randomly just said "Fuck you, I'm actually considering the tattoo now" and I just laughed

Btw my mom and I are really close so occasionally we're like "Shut up biiiiiitch" and similar stuff as a joke
