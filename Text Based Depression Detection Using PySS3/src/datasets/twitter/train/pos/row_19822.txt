Why is Cassie Cage's "Testi-kill" from Mortal Kombat X a thing? How is that any better than having a male character that can specifically ram knives into the groins of female characters (but not male ones), and you see their vaginas being turned into minced meat, and selling that as "boypower" or some shit??
