The pedophile problem and how to solve it There have been multiple posts on this subreddit about pedophiles and other people that are harassing users of this subreddit.

Here's the Problem, this subreddit has 2 kinds of users. The intended users, i.e teenagers, referred to as prey here, and the other group that I'll call predators.

Predators will browse through the subreddit in order to find a Target. It's Important to understand how they will find their targets, this is a difficult task however especially because it'll change once the behavior of the prey changes. Also, different predators will have different targeting strategies. For some everyone is a Target, others choose at random and others again might just take a look at what age tag. One save way to be targeted seems to be posting a picture of your face, so don't do that if you're trying to avoid being targeted. In a specific case, someone asked for Help with learning a language and then was harassed by some +20 year old creep, but he wasn't just straight up texting "send nudes", he only started showing his intentions after a while. In my opinion the best tactic isn't to avoid being targeted, but rather find out when you have been targeted and then act the right way.

The only safe way to not be targeted is to not post or comment, so the better tactic is to identify the predator and act accordingly.

The most important thing is to be careful about what information you give about yourself on the internet. As long as you know that they don't know where you live or what you look like, they literally can't do anything except for messaging you, which is annoying but not harmful and they will stop after some time of ignoring. But as I said, sometimes they are more sneaky and not as obvious in their intentions. My advice against those people is the following:

- should someone message you directly, check their profiles before doing anything else and look for suspicious details in their post history. For example, if they have very low to no karma, no posts, no comments or weird/creepy posts/comments.

- if you think they're safe to message back, do so with cautiousness and don't give any more information about you to them than you gave in your posts already

- the less links they have to you, the easier it is to cut contact once they reveal themselves to be a predator. For example, if the only way of contacting you is your reddit account, you can just block them and then the only thing you have to worry about is their secondary accounts, and if that doesn't work you can just creates a new account and leave the old one behind. However, if someone has your email address, discord account, phone number, etc. it becomes increasingly hard to cut them out of your life.

- to summarize: be careful about what information you give to people, don't post pictures of your face, ignore obvious creeps, be careful about who you write with and make sure that you can cut contact if things should get weird.
