Quick reminder that even though it may not seem like it we're in the golden age of public highschool right now So my school had the option to either do online classes or in person, I chose in person because I was getting bored hanging out with the same people everyday. What you may not realize is that if your school is like mine, all the work is done electronically, even things like notes and worksheets. 

Basically, ask your guidance counselor to sign up for online classes but still have the option to go to school. If your school is like mine you can make the argument that when a case pops up you're not allowed to show up for a few days and you still need to get your work done. you get the best of both worlds. If you want to go out on a weeknight, cool. Stay home the next day and just make sure to log in to your core classes to do everything you need to do. Wake up and feel like gaming all day? Fuxking do it man no one's stopping you now. 

this shit is so easily cheesed it feels like school is just a formality at this point.
