got back my results for my finals honestly, it was bad. i dropped a grade from my previous tests for most subjects. i didnâ€™t hit any of my targets at all. 

however, i feel bad complaining and beating myself over it in front of my friends, who had done much much worse. so iâ€™m going to this sub to clear up my thoughts

firstly, iâ€™m extremely disappointed in myself, and i feel like the biggest idiot in the world. why was my useless ass even born? iâ€™m such a burden to earthâ€™s resources honestly, i cant even get an A in my finals. i feel that the world sucks and i screwed up big time. 

secondly, i know its my fault for not studying for my finals at all. i was too burned out and got sick so much during the month before, and was told to reduce studying and using my brain in general, so i completely ditched my studies. i should have been more careful of my health.

lastly, although i may be upset now, i know iâ€™m going to get over this temporary sadness soon, since being sad about this wonâ€™t do anything other than waste time where i could have been doing more productive things. 

so yes, i think i feel a lot better after getting this off my chest, since my friends canâ€™t understand me
