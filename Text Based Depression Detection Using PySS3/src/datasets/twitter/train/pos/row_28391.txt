I came looking for diamond... and I just found silver, but idk if I should mine it... So I own an instagram meme page. About 600 followers. I started this page to make some money in the future through sponsorships. I originally planned to wait for 3k followers until I do any deals though. 

I want to get some ear buds. I went looking on amazon for some with low ratings so that I can potentially get them for free. I just donâ€™t know if I should do it or not. 

Obviously I would hit up the seller, and ask for the product for free, and in return I would leave a good rating and maybe shout them out on my Instagram story. I donâ€™t really want to bring that account into this just yet though. 

I will probably msg a seller and ask for some free ones and I leave a good rating, but leave out the Instagram part.

What do you guys think?
