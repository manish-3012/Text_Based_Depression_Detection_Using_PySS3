Why the hecc do people come to.me for relationship advice??? Have they not met me and think I'm sociable enough to ask a girl out??? Twice now people have asked for advice to ask a girl out and another for girl trouble and I can't fathom what puts me in the position to give help. I can listen but my advice would be stupid and not helpful to anyone. 

I mean to be fair its quite the confidence boost but I literally told the person who asked to help ask someone out to just have it, as if that's any help at all.
