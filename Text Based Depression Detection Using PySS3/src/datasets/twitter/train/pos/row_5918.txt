Fine if nobody's gonna say it I will Tik tok isn't bad or cringe it is just a platform for people to post short vids but most of the community is cringe and severely annoying. that's the problem

Simp is a word used for boys who do too much for girl's, not for guys who assist a girl in an argument because she is right

People posting "tik tok bad reddit good" or "fortnite bad minecraft good" are mostly karma whores



Fortnite still sucks though
No offense
