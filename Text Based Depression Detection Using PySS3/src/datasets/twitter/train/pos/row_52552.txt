I found out how my old classmate died Basically since kindergarten I went to school with this girl and she was pretty cool but quiet and at the end of 6th grade she left and went to a different school for middle school I donâ€™t think she had many friends she mostly kept to her self and a week ago my school told us she died but didnâ€™t tell us how and yesterday my mom got an email telling her that the girl who died killed herself shit just seems so unreal she was 13 and itâ€™s crazy she seemed happy but people like to have masks and I just wanted to say anyone thinking about suicide please donâ€™t it effects everyone around you even you think no one cares they do, I care we all care you matter everybody matters.
