Desperate and 19 (getting my life back on track) Hi kind people, 
I recently had to leave school because i couldn't handle the load and things at home were just making everything worse. Our family sorely depended on my father for everything financially, but in these parts of Africa, kids are raised as investments and there's no mental health available for teenagers, so for a very long time I've been having depression, anxiety, panick attacks. At first i didn't know what was happening but after googling symptoms and seeing some professionals, i confirmed my assumption. 
I tried self care, thinking positively, and just generally trying to make each moment better than yesterday. 
My dad was recently released from work due to downsizing, and we've had to drastically change our lifestyle. 
As the first born, i have been blamed for everything that goes wrong in this house, it was no surprise i got blamed for my dad getting fired. And since then each day has been worse than before. 
I was unable to cope with school and failed some subjects, and im about extremely introverted person that it's hard for me to share anything about my life with anyone. 
I have been kicked out from home, all my dreams shattered, and idk what to do. 
During this covid pandemic, i have been creating graphic designs for some clients, i would go to the local cyber or just use my phone (which is too old and slow for the work im doing)
All i'm asking now is for some kind souls to kindly assist me raising some money and getting a laptop (i found a HP elitebook for around $350)
I am an avid graphic designer, upcoming programmer who mainly works with his phone and its hard. I can't share my email here according to the rules, but if anyone is willing to help out just dm and I'll provide an email.

TL:DR got kicked out, depends on phone as a source of generating income, kindly asking any kind souls to help a fellow redditor raise around $300
