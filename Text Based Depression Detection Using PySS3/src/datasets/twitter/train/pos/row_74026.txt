Being lonely is the worst any tips for improving would be appreciated I just now started talking to my friends again after four months of sitting alone in my room. I donâ€™t know why I have so much trouble talking to people. Itâ€™s like I want to have friends but I hate the process of being social. Iâ€™ve cut off bad habits I had due to being bored and lonely which I feel like is a start.
