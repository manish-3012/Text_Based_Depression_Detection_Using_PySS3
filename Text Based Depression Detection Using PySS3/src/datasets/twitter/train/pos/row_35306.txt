I saw my ex at the grocery store today and she walked up to me and tried to apologize for cheating but I ignored her and walked to my car and left, didn't even acknowledge her presence It was really hard and I wanted to cry the whole time because I honestly miss her but I feel like I can't give her another chance. Did I do the right thing?
