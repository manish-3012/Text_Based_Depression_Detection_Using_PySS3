My friends are drunks. Please help me This literally happened like 20 mins ago. I met with two of my friends at the in my village. I heard they usually meet there so I asked them if I can go with them. They said yes. So I went there and they had a bottle of RosÃ©. They were allowed to drink because the drinking age is 16 in Germany. So anyway we chilled at the lake while they were drinking and I had a really bad feeling. I had to be at home at 8am. So when they decided to go to get a sixpack of beer in the next village, I quit and said maybe next time. I don't know what to do. How can I convince them to stop drinking that much at once?
