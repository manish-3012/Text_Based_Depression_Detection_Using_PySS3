I am an idiot I was walking to first bell Band and there was this girl walking in front of me to the general direction of the band room.  I didn't recognize her.  I'm thinking to myself, "Maybe she's going to the office or she's a freshman band member.  We keep walking in silence until we reach the room.  She was right behind me, so I hold the door for her and she says "Thank you" "You're welcome".  I thought her voice sounded familiar, but so didn't get a good look at her face, especially with the masks.  When I walk in, I walk to my seat at the other side of the room, and she's standing by the wall near the doorway.  Then she left the room.  I racked my brain when we weren't playing trying to remember so she was because she seemed familiar.  After class we walk to next period and I see her again and I get a good glimpse of her face and I knew who she was immediately.

Any takers?  It was the girl who I've had a bit of crush on since eighth grade (I'm a sophomore).  She dyed her hair and sometimes people can look totally different.

I'm still a little disappointed in myself because of this lol.
