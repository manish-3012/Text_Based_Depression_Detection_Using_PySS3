Advice needed For transparency, this is about my teenage daughter.   She is 18 and started college last Fall. 

She is very introverted and has a very hard time making friends.  She is extremely smart but also very awkward and has very little self confidence.   

Iâ€™m trying to help her come out of her shell and get out and meet more people.   Itâ€™s just not working.  She stays in her dorm room all day .. she rarely sees her roommate who shacks up with her boyfriend.   

Any suggestions from teenagers out there to help her?  What could a parent say to you that would help?  Anything?? 

Thanks for your advice!
