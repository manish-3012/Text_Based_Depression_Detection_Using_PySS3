Possible unpopular opinion, peace tea is nasty I don't understand the point of it either? Is it an energy drink? Is supposed to be the same concept as snapple? I thought it was like twisted tea and wondered why I was ab6to buy it as a minor. To say I was disappointed is an understatement.

If you like peace tea what is the best flavor. I'm willing to give it another go lol
