Couldnâ€™t think of an opposite to this shitty sub but Iâ€™ll Chuck it on the list :) r/politics

Sure I could find a right wing sub to add as an opposite, but all right wing subs Iâ€™ve seen donâ€™t claim to be a general political sub, for example something like r/conservative. r/politics however somewhat claims to be neutral but is incredibly â€œleftâ€ wing. r/politicalcompassmemes could be argued to be a viable opposite, but that sub is based and i liek it.
