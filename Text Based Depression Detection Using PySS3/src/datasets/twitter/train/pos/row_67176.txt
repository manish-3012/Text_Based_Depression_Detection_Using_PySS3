Why does this person keep coming back to my life? I'm already moving on with my life and boom, they came back AGAIN but I know they (and I) won't stay for long so I ain't going to get attached again

this is the third time they came back but no matter how many times they came back, our connection with each other can't seem to be back to how it was anymore.

honestly, i think it's better if we don't speak forever since our closeness level has already been severed and it's awkward that they keep fading in and out into my life...but they just keep coming back
