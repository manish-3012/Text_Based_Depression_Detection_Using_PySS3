I keep having dreams about my old friends I donâ€™t know why this keeps happening but here are my two most memorable ones. In my first dream, I was walking down the hallway of my school and I notice one of my old friends. I stopped and said hi in disbelief. We started walking together and then I see another of my friends. This happens a couple more times until weâ€™re all just one big entourage. Whatâ€™s weird is that my brain managed to picture them as if they were in high school  and I have no idea how it did that considering I havenâ€™t seen them since 6th grade. It was honestly one of my happiest dreams. The second one is pretty consistent. Itâ€™s usually about this one girl who I think had a crush on me and I probably had a crush on her and she moved to my school. My dream would always be me trying to talk to her or get her attention to see if she remembers me, but Iâ€™m always too shy to say something. 

Thanks for reading if you actually did. Iâ€™m assuming these dreams mean I actually miss my old friends and I regret not keeping in contact with any of them. So I guess the moral of the story is to not let go of the people you care about. Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.
