Tired of fighting over his addiction to certain games. It doesn't matter how many times he promises he won't play for hours while I'm at his house. It doesn't matter if he promises we can play a game together when I'm at home. He never keeps his promises. I'm tired of staying the night and waking up to him yelling with his friends on a game at 7am. I'm tired of having to explain why I go home when he joins a voice channel on discord for a game. We've discussed it multiple times and he's said multiple times he doesn't want to play his games when I come over. Today he got on Rust because his friend got scared of some other players. He got up and loaded in faster than he comes to check on me when I'm crying or hurt. I'm tired of being put to the side over imaginary worlds and some lines of code.

You don't have to say anything, I just needed to write out the feelings.
