Do you guys also hate this weird feeling, when somebody told you thing that you didnâ€™t want to know? Especially if it is a secret that you can not share.. Like, I had this situation hundreds of times, and I HATE it. 


One time my friend told me, that one girl from my class was trying to unlock my phone when I left it in class. 

And then he told me that it is a fricking secret and he shouldnâ€™t tell me that, because this girl asked him to. 

And you know what? Previous day, my other friend told me that my â€œfirstâ€ friend, who told me this secret, has crush. Guess what? His crush is this girl. 

That is SICK situation. Now I know this 2 secrets I canâ€™t tell it anyone. And every time Iâ€™m talking with that girl I feel weird, because I know what did she. But if I will ask her why she has done it (tried to unlock my phone and opened my bag), she will understand WHO has told me that, and any relationships between these two will end. And I also canâ€™t ask my friend to talk with this girl, because he will ask â€œwhy should Iâ€, but I canâ€™t tell him BECAUSE my other friend also told me that what he has told me it is a fricking secret (and also he told me that my first friend told him that he is the only person who knows)! So I canâ€™t answer like â€œbecause you love her and because of that I canâ€™t ask her because that will end all possible of some relationships between you and herâ€, because my first friend will immediately understand who told me that. 

So Iâ€™m in the situation where I have 2 secrets, which I DONT WANT TO KNOW, and I canâ€™t do anything with them! I also canâ€™t share them with anyone, because that will make everything even worse (and I really donâ€™t like to tell secrets - they are still secrets). 

My life sucks..
