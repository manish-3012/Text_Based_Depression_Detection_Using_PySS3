lost in teenage years does anyone else here ever feel like they arenâ€™t gonna make it successfully out of being a teenager? i really am not sure what hobbies i like, what interests me, im just a boring teenager that works her ass off all of the time. i just need advice or need to know im not the only one, i feel like im gonna fail at being an adult/having a stable life.
