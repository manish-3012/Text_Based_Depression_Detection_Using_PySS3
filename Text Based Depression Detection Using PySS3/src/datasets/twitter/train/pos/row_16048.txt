day 3 of rating my bus ride [late] this is for last nights bus ride. it's a little late but oh well. ok so it's a 7/10 for this one. sat next to noone, and it was great to chill by myself. I got some homework done and listened to more music. nothing much else really happened. just a usual ride. ok well see you this evening for my day 4. bye.
