hereâ€™s a dumb story about why I be feeling guilty to preface, I have my best friend. weâ€™ve got sm history and are like a married couple (no literally, we even had a fake marriage 2 years ago)

and I have another buddy who I talk to just as much as my wifey, but yk, itâ€™s not the same, but I feel rly bad because this buddy frequently talks to me about how theyâ€™re always a second choice and forgotten.  it seems like I sometimes hurt their feelings without realizing when I talk about my wifey but Iâ€™ve been talking about my wifey since the beginning of time and donâ€™t even realize when I bring her up.  but I get really emotionally invested with ppl so now Iâ€™m feeling guilty. dw, ik this is dumb, Iâ€™m feeling emotional though
