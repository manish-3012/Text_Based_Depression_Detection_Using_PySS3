Ranting just because I used to think I was lost ,but now ,GOD FUCKING DAMM IT 
I donâ€™t understand anything thatâ€™s happing around me ,that or I donâ€™t want to understand
I have no one to tell anything  I mean like a best friend ,which I can trust
But for me itâ€™s also really hard to trust anyone enough to deep enough 
I got a friend which I usually play games with or in the break we will play chess
But I donâ€™t really feel like, I canâ€™t  tell him this , I usually just joke around with me having all this things which I do have but I act like I donâ€™t 
He has reddit so if heâ€™s reading this itâ€™s all true 

I like a girl which  basically my only point on life ,not because Iâ€™m passionate about romance ,but because itâ€™s the only things which I understand how to do it ,Iâ€™m just not good enough 
I know she ainâ€™t gonna like me ,because no one does , the problem is me
I can trust anyone  then I complain about not being able to have anyone to trust , 
I like weird stuff , and most importantly I donâ€™t need a gf for the usual things
Ppl at my age want a gf to say they have a gf or to make out 
But I need one to be hugged ,to feel loved 
I know I canâ€™t reach that because I donâ€™t love ,that why people donâ€™t love me back 

Thatâ€™s another problem ,Iâ€™m numb inside , I totally donâ€™t feel nothing inside 
I canâ€™t love anyone  , I donâ€™t feel a interest for nothing
I donâ€™t really have hook that is tying to me to being alive like I say â€œI canâ€™t die because of this â€œ
I have no interest in video games anymore , I donâ€™t have no interest in anything ,anymore 
It just feels like I am tryna pass time and donâ€™t being alone 
I mean I just set myself goals ,because if not I would lose everything I have worked for 
Maybe get a certain item ,or learn a new alg ,or talk so someone ,or get a good grade 
Because if I didnâ€™t I would be a robot ,running in gasoline , 
Well who says I ainâ€™t already 

I donâ€™t even know why am I writing this , 3 people is gonna read it ,donâ€™t comment . ainâ€™t things gonna get better .later Iâ€™m gonna go hug my pillow like if someone loved me but I know they donâ€™t so imma start crying , I like telling myself Iâ€™m trying but I donâ€™t like lying , I am gonna die but I ainâ€™t gonna live ,I am gonna fight but I ainâ€™t gonna win,Im gonna get the pain but not the love , Iâ€™m gonna be lost but I ainâ€™t ever gonna find me,Iâ€™m gonna get the bad but not the good , 

I have a lot of thoughts , but saying them out loud is tough 
I scream and yell but I feel speechless because I donâ€™t yell where they can hear me
To how knows me personally who is reading this ,please help 
And to anyone on the internet ,I would appreciate advice , or just a comment 
So I feel like there is someone reading this
