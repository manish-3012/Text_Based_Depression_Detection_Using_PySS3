Going to get a gaming laptop today I've been doing a lot of research and with a little bit of help from Linus and selling my stuff on eBay I'm finally going to get the gateway creator :) it has an rtx 2060 and an i5 10th gen so it'll be more powerful then any other device I've been on, I'm really excited to have a go on it and I'm really happy it's so cheap (compared to other laptops with similar specs which are up to 1200$). Anyway just wanted to say how happy I was and share my little excitement ðŸ™‚
