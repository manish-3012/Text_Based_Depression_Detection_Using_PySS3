â€˜Donâ€™t let it ruin your night!!â€™ Ok this is so random, but just wanted to tell yâ€™all because iâ€™ve been thinking about this. And this refers to short term relationships btw. 

Going through a breakup is hard. Getting broken up with is painful. It hurts. I hate it when people say â€˜aww donâ€™t let it ruin your night!â€™ or â€˜donâ€™t cryâ€™ to someone who has just been broken up with. Of course itâ€™s gonna ruin their night! Of course they are going to cry. It is so fake and apathetic to say that to someone, even though obviously I know people are just trying to help. Rather, this is the point I like to try and get across:

Of course this is going to ruin your night. And thatâ€™s ok. This is something worth crying about. You can cry on my shoulder if you want! But once you have let it all out, cried all of your tears and gotten through the painful moment, itâ€™s time to move on. But, you can only move on once you let out all of your emotions and deal with what you are going through rather than bottling them up. So right now, cry! Be upset. Accept that this breakup is happening, and react to the situation. Tomorrow morning, wake up with a fresh point of view and start thinking about how you can move forward.

You canâ€™t just brush breakups off and pretend they didnâ€™t happen. Because they did. But thatâ€™s ok. Instead, take the time to accept it. You can only move forward once you deal with the past. 

I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s the right way of saying things, but thatâ€™s my point! Let me know if you agree :))
