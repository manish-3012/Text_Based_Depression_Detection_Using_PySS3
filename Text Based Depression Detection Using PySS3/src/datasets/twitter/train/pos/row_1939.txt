This is the worst time of my life. I just got out of a relationship with a guy I really liked, Iâ€™m pretty sure he wishes I was dead or just that heâ€™d never talked to me in the first place, I know itâ€™s because I am too clingy a lot of the time. Two days ago I moved into college and I am here now, I am focused on academics but the people here are not. I am in a nice apartment surrounded by other apartments that are full of people that love to party until the daylight hours. I canâ€™t sleep with the noise. I lost my dad earlier this year and we had to put our dog down last week. I am definitely not in the headspace to work. I donâ€™t like the city this university is in, itâ€™s in the middle of Missouri and surrounded by run down neighborhoods and places of the like. I have never felt more useless and lost than I am right now. My mom left to go back home and now itâ€™s just me. Alone, here.
