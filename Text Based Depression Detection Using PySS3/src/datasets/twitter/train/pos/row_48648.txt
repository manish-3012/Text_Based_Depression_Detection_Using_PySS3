I figured out how to play any game for free Not sure if this works for playsatation, but Xbox and steam have a refund policy where you can return any game if you owned it for less than 2 weeks and have less than 2 hours played. I've done this 4 times: buy a game on an alt account, [gameshare](https://youtu.be/2aSw3_8tBHo) it to your main so all your play time is on that account, then just return it within 2 weeks when you're done playing. Just wanted to share this exploit idk.
