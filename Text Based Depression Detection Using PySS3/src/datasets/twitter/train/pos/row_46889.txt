Some advice for the girls Girls if you like a guy and I mean really like a guy donâ€™t be a tsundere and act like you donâ€™t like them, because they might lose interest in you or just think that you donâ€™t like them, (weâ€™re kinda dumb like that but thatâ€™s because some of us donâ€™t find that cute). Also if you have the confidence then just tell them that you like them because who knows they might like you back. I hope this helps someone out with understanding some guys a bit more, I know not all guys are like this but I know a lot of people including myself, who feel the same way.
