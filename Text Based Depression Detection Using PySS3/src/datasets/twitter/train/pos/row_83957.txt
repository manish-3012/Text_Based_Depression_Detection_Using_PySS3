First date (I guess) happening tonight! Hi guys :&gt; 
So basically, my gf and I have been dating for maybe two weeks now! Itâ€™s really nice. She confessed and I had mutual feelings, weâ€™ve both been crushing since January. Itâ€™s also both of our first relationships and hopefully the only one.
Weâ€™re gonna go see a play my friend is in tonight. Since I canâ€™t drive Iâ€™m gonna give her some flowers from my familyâ€™s garden and some home-grown lemons of mine.
Iâ€™m really nervous but really excited too! Any tips on like...anything related to dating? We dont go to the same school anymore (i now go to a charter high school)
