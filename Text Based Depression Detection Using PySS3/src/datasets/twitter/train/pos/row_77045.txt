Take care of your pets no matter what. Im 15 if you guys wanted to know.
Today i came home to find my goldfish Harrie dead.
I could've done more to protect him.
He had a lump on his head which was caused by fungus.
I had the medicine to keep it from causing more harm.
Yet i was too lousy to bother thinking about the medicine.
The result is he passed away.

I fully blame my own lousy behavior on his death.

I was a bad owner.

To all people reading this please take care of your pets no matter what, i beg of you.
A pet intelligent or not deserves to live a happy and comfortable life.
So don't do what i did please.
If there is odd behavior that your pet is showing go to a vet.

Thanks for reading this and i wish you and your pets happy lives!
