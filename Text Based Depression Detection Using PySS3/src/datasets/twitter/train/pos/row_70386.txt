The mollusk pts 1-14 (this was a big influence on spongebob) Since people liked my post on the pod (wink wink not really people didn't care) I've decided to do the mollusk because I can  

Pt 1 dancing in the show tonight 

[Verse 1]
Are my ribbons tied? Is my hair in place?
Have I got a cute expression on my face?
And my shoes all shined, I'll try to keep in line
When I'm dancing in the show tonight

[Verse 2]
Does my shuffle step really look so good?
Am I doing it the way you think I should?
Would it be amiss if I blew a kiss
When I'm dancing in the show tonight?

[Chorus]
Showtime now is getting nearer
And I'm getting scared
Wish I could see in the mirror
If I'm all prepared

[Verse 3]
First, you take a step then you point your toe
Hope I know it like I did a week ago
Am I standing straight? I can hardly wait
To be dancing in the show tonight

[Chorus]
Showtime now is getting nearer
And I'm getting scared
Wish I could see in the mirror
If I'm all prepared
 
First, you take a step then you point your toe
Hope I know it like I did a week ago
Am I standing straight? I can hardly wait
To be dancing in the show tonight


Pt 2 the mollusk 

[Verse 1]
Hey little boy, what you got there?
Kind sir, it's a mollusk I've found
Did you find it in the sandy ground?
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?
Yes, I found it on the ground
Emulating the ocean's sound

[Chorus]
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

[Verse 2]
Hey little boy, come walk with me
And bring your newfound mollusk along
Does it speaketh of the Trinity?
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye?
Yes, it speaks of the Trinity
Casting light at the sun with its wandering eye

[Chorus]
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me
Let's be forever, let forever be free

[Instrumental]
 

Outro]
You see, there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand (Yes)
The waking of all creatures, that live on the land (Yes)
And with just one faint glance, back into the sea (No)
The mollusk lingers... with its wandering eye (No)

[Instrumental]


Pt 3 polkadot tail 

[Verse 1]
Did you ever see a whale
With a polka dot tail?
Did you ever see a man
With eight fingers on his hand?
Did you have to dry your eye
When you saw that puppy fly?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried to shrink
Like an ice cube in the sink?
Have you ever tried to see
What lies hidden in the tree?
Have you ever made a flan
And squished it in your hand?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

Billy-

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried to shrink
Like an ice cube in the sink?
Have you ever tried to see
What lies hidden in the tree?
Have you ever made a flan
And squished it in your hand?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so [Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a whale
With a polka dot tail?
Did you ever see a man
With eight fingers on his hand?
Did you have to dry your eye
When you saw that puppy fly?
Oh no
Tell me it ain't so

Help me-

Pt5 mutilated lips 

Verse 1]
I lick my brain in silence
Rather squeeze my head instead
Midget man provoking violence
Listen not to what I said
I said, "Please calm it down."
Everything is turning brown

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

[Verse 2]
Laughing lady living lover
Ooh, you sassy-frassy lassie
Find me the skull of Haile Selassie I
Give me shoes so I can tapsy
Tap all over this big world
Take my hand, you ugly girl Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish
Mutilated lips give a kiss on the wrist
Of the wormlike tips
Of tentacles expanding in my mind
I'm fine, accepting only fresh brine
You can get another drop of this
Yeah, you wish

Pt6 the blarney Stone 

[Verse 1]
Get off my ass, ya wee bitty fuck
If I pull out the claymore, you're shit outta luck
Who is that girl, that pretty young thing
After I fuck her, she'll get up and sing

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 2]
Down to the pub, for a two-shillin' ale
The bread on the counter is goin' stale
If I don't get some fresh bread soon
Gonna punch you in your face, and bark at the moon

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no girl, 'cuz I haven't the time
Got too many other things on me mind
Patty was nice, she was pale and cute
But I threw her away, like an old piece of fruit  

Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye

[Verse 4]
Got tombs in me pores, my feet are all wet
Got mold in my ears, but I ain't dead yet
Got stones in me bladder, got a crack in me head
When Patty starts cryin', this is what I said

[Chorus]
Aye, aye, aye
Sharpen your boot, and bludgeon your eye
Aye, aye, aye
The Blarney Stone brings a tear to me eye 


Pt7 it's gonna be alright 

Verse 1]
Baby what have I done
Gone and left you all alone
It's hard for me to sing this song
We've been together for so long
I think I know what my soul's gotta say
And it won't hurt as bad someday

[Chorus]
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you

[Verse 2]
Guess I'm ruled by my heart
Built a life and I tore it all apart
It's just not our time
But you'll find a new love and you'll be fine
So many dark and lonely nights
But I believe someday I'll see the light

[Chorus]
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you
It's gonna be alright baby
It's gonna be alright love
And if the mist ever lets the sun through
I just hope I did the right thing
For me and you
For me and you

Pt8 the golden eel 

[Verse 1]
Sitting alone in the den
Watching the eel
Help me find my way home
Watching the eel
Burrows its head in the sand
Daylight has come
There shall be rest in a while
Daylight has come

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

[Verse 2]
Who can explain all these thoughts
Racking my mind
An endless barrage of shit
Racking my mind
The eel offered his help
I can't understand
Speaking its truth from the bank
Now I can see

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel 

Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel
I cannot reveal
The words of the golden eel

Pt9 cold blows the wind 

[Verse 1]
Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain
I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day

[Verse 2]
But when twelve months were come and gone
This young man he arose
What makes you weep down by my grave
I can't take my repose
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
One kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips
And return back to your grave

[Verse 3]
My lips they are as cold as my clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips
Thy days would not be long
Oh don't you remember the garden grove
Where we used to walk
Pluck the finest flower of them all
Twill wither to a stalk 


[Verse 4]
Go fetch me a nun from a dungeon deep
And water from a stone
And white milk from a maiden's breast
That babe ere never known
Go dig me a grave both long wide and deep
As quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep
For twelve month and one day

[Verse 1 reprise]
Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love
And in Camville he was slain
I'll do as much for my true love
As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve month and one day 

Pt10 pink eye on my leg 

instrumental

Barking 

Moaning 

Pt11 waving my dick in the wind 

[Verse 1]
I'm waving my dick in the wind
I'm waving my dick in the wind
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight
But I'm waving my dick in the wind

[Verse 2]
I'm lost in the sauce once again
I'm lost in the sauce once again
If I make it through the night, everything will be alright
But I'm lost in the sauce once again

[Bridge]
It's been ninety-seven days since I laid my head beside you
And a million miles of highway in-between
There's some red and blue lights that are shining right behind me
And that pig's pretty mean, bastard

[Verse 3]
You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
Give that boy a dime, and you could have a chance
To see old Jimmy Wilson dance

[Bridge]
(Dance, Jimmy
I'm doin' the best I can, right there
That's it
You know, I can't really dance like I used to. I mean I'll try, but I'm an old, old man now)
I've got a real good feeling 'bout old Jimmy Wilson
Sure enough, he's got what it takes
Do another number for me, please won't you, Jimmy?
Cause you're a real good dancer
(Ooh, yeah, cut me down!) 

[Verse 1 reprise]
I'm waving my dick in the wind (aa-oo-aa)
I'm waving my dick in the wind (aa-oo-aa)
If it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight
But I'm waving my dick in the wind
Waving my dick in the wind
I'm waving my, dick in the wind 

Pt12 Buckingham green (my favorite from the album currently) 

[Verse 1]
A child without an eye
Made her mother cry, why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green

[Verse 2]
The children saw the eye
As a sign from God descending from the sky...
It was alright to dream
Of Buckingham Green

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
"Summon the queen!"
Spoke the child of eye, "It's time to fly."
Turning fire to steam
On Buckingham Green

[Verse 1]
A child without an eye
Made her mother cry why ask why?
She kept her child clean
On Buckingham Green

Pt13 ocean man (fun fact mourning glory from pure guava was gonna be used in the end credits of the spongebob movie instead of this) 

Ocean man, take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man
Ocean man, take me by the hand
Lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe
Is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement
At the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth
To the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land
Ocean Man

Pt 14 a she wanted to leave 

Three men is all they were.
Three men out at sea.
Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me.
I couldn't believe
She wanted to leave
She wanted to leave.
I loved you so long.
Since you were a child.
I've cared for your every need.
I've tried to make you smile.
And all the while
You wanted to leave
You wanted to leave.
Go gather the guns.
We'll blast them at sea.
She begged for me not to shoot,
"For my true love is here with me."
I've never loved thee
Now I must leave
Now I must leave.
So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends and fill up my glass to the rim.
For I'm not the man I used to be
Now I'm one of them.

Pt14 b reprise
