Hey, teens. Is it only me, or don't you miss the good ol' days when the only jokes you heard were either dad jokes, poop jokes and intelligent jokes, instead of listening to crude rape jokes, dumb humour, cum jokes, necrophilia jokes and other disgusting humour?

I mean, I won't mind a good sex joke, but ALL THE TIME?! Plus really sick ones.
