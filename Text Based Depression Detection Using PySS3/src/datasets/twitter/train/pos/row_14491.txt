I don't understand why people don't like going to the dentist. Its the fucking BEST. Dentist offices are never too cold, and it feels so safe. Dentists are always nice and let you know what they are doing before they do it. Its so professional. They always make sure you are comfortable and don't make things awkward. 

Lowkey, its kinda hot. I think I might marry a dentist.
