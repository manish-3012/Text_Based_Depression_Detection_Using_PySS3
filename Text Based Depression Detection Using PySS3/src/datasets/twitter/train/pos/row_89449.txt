I feel better Last few months I have been really able to find joy in the little things in life.
Before that I was almost never really happy.
I enlist to the army (not USA) tomorrow and I know it sounds weird but in a way it feels to me like death and rebirth.
Hope I don't fall into a deep depression in the army again.
Just feeling a little happy that I got better, I still hate the way I look but I'll work on it.
Hope to find some friends in the military, and have fun there too.
And I also hope that I can enjoy myself at home and that I will not feel that time is moving too fast.

So for anyone feeling down or is depressed rn know that Better times can come but it may require you to Change your perspective.

Just wanted to get this off my chest.
