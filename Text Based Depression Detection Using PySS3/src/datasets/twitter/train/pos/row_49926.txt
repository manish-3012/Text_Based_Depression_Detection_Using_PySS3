MY SCHOOL GOT ESPORTS!!! YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA There is SO MUCH I want to just spill out, but basically my school has some awesome teachers that started an ESports Club! We are doing Overwatch, Fortnite, Rocket League, LoL, SMITE, Madden, FIFA, and eventually Smash, Mario Kart, COD, Rainbow, and more!  


There is a room dedicated that I can help the teacher design, as he basically made me the student leader of the club. I am in charge of the Discord, organization, and more stuff.  


I'm really excited because we have a BIG budget and I can't wait, even though I will graduate in 2 years. It's still great.  


The best part? We got on the news. Check it:

This is amazing, and I thought I would share because if you tried bringing it to your school, it IS possible. Keep asking for it, organize it yourself so the teachers feel more inclined. Do whatever you can because more schools will be opening this club.  


BTW my school is in Northeast Pennsylvania.
