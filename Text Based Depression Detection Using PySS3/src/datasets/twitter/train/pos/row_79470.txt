This hits a little too close to home So... Just burned through my massive backlog of to watch anime and. disclaimer:watch school days for more context. Just finished watching (School days) and it feels oddly familiar. (obviously im talking about the first half of the show) and its making me reevaluate the choices ive made in dating. Im (16 m)
And im at a loss for what i should do. Should I remain the same or change for better or for worse I honestly don't know. My mates have recently gotten me really strange advice "chase what your mind says" and some other things I can't for the love of God remember cuz we were all massively drunk.


So anyway I dont know what to do about all this. And if you're wondering I've slept with 5 different girls NOT AT THE SAME TIME. and currently dating one of them. I have this voice in the back of my head telling me to prepare for the worst and cut all contact with all of them except my gf. But the thing is 3 of my ex's are friends with my current gf and 1 is her cousin. During the dating phase I've noticed some red flags with each of them but the 2 overlapping red flags are they're really clingy, and slightly possessive. At the time I didn't think much of it cuz I was dating them one at a time with a 1-3 month grace period before I started dating again. Each relationship lasted on average 3-4 months. and yeah I kinda forgot where I was going with this. But bottom line is I just needed to let off some steam. Thx for listening (im an aussie btw for the 2 guys that was wondering.)
