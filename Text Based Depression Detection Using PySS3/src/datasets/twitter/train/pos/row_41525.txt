Iâ€™m one of the girls but I need to say something I am a gamer, which means I relate to â€œthe boysâ€ somewhat, I like things like COD and among us like the things that the boys like, and I really wish I could just relate to these communities but oh my god you guys are so mean, body shamers, misogynists, homophobes, transphobia, I donâ€™t understand why some guys have to be so mean for no reason
