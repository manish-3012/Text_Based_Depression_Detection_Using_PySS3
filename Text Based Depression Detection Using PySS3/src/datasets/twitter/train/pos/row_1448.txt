So I was googling sewing advice So I wanted to find some cosplay tips for a costume I want to make, and so I went to google, and my own freaking reddit post of a animal crossing outfit I made was there. It was weird. You canâ€™t even find anything if you google my name, but look up a fictional character and Iâ€™m there. I was very confused but anyways Iâ€™m basically a celebrity now. lol.
