Well guys, I did it I asked a girl out and she said yes. Iâ€™m happy with this, even if weâ€™re not dating. 

And to the however many read this far, I need your help. Half of this sub is depressed, so I guess Iâ€™ll ask your coping techniques. Iâ€™m kind of past the point of no return, I just threw away hundreds of scholarships and an early college program because my depression took away motivation to do literally anything. Iâ€™ve been debating talking to my brother about it, but Iâ€™m honestly not sure it wouldnâ€™t ruin our relationship. Any advice from the teens here?

And dad. In case you can read this, although Iâ€™m pretty sure you can, Iâ€™m sorry. 

Have a nice day fellow teens, youâ€™re all beautiful.
