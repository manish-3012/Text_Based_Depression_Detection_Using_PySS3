Just realized majority of my friends are at school friends which kinda sucks balls rn. Is anyone trying to be homies? Iâ€™m a 15 girl btw going into sophomore year and once we shifted to online school I realized I really donâ€™t have that many (5-10) not just friends in school. Some of those 5ish Iâ€™m barely close with and loneliness is kinda biting me in the ass. So is anyone just trying to vibe and be homies. Need some more friends rn.
