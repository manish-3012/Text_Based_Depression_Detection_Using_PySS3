I wanted to tell you something Well I might kill myself...well I always thought about it but I canâ€™t take it anymore, there is no future for me or a hope I waited so long for someone anyone who just needs me even a real friend. If I was going to die I always wanted to tell someone to take care of them selves, eat well and live on. Iâ€™m 20 so I think still a teenager and I have no one so I tell all people here that please be kind most importantly with yourself, eat well, go and make your dreams a reality. I love you and Iâ€™m sure there is someone out there who cares for you. Bye Bye
