Finland doesn't exist Okay bare with me for a second and let me explain.
Your tring to tell me that thers just this country named after finn from adventure time *sure*. All it takes is a quick bit of research to find that adventure time was released April 10th 2010 now how old is 'Finland' you ask, 130000 years old. First of all how can a country named after finn from adventure time exist before adventure time even existed and second of all a can a country exist for more than 130000 years when as we all know the earth is only 2020 years old. Its all bullshit people open your eyes. Finland was just invented by aliens to test how easy it is to fool us humans WELL IM NOT FOOLED AND NEITHER SHOULD U! open your eyes the truth is out there

And that was my ted talk, thank you for comming
