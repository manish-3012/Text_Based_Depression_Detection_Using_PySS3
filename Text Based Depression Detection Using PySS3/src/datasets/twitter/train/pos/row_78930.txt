Not wanting to answer the phone should be a valid excuse to not picking up the phone Whenever someone I don't want to talk to calls me, I don't answer their phone. When I meet them in person they say, "why didn't you answer my call". I feel like I can't straight up say I didn't want to because I feel like it's an unwritten rule, when in reality it shouldn't be. 

^excuse ^me ^if ^there ^is ^any ^grammar ^mistakes
