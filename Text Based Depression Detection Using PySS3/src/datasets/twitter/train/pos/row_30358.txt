My school is in lockdown My school just went into lock down for some reason we're hiding in the drama room and no one will shut up. This is coming from a small high school of 800~ people in Australia, Queensland we have no idea what it is that's causing the lockdown. The rumor is that a bunch of fights broke out so I guess they don't want a riot. Pretty scary stuff
