Bored and want to make new friends Hey Iâ€™m 16(F) and Iâ€™m fairly new on reddit. I havenâ€™t really made any friends and a lot of people ghost. I like reading, cooking, music, anime, video games, and just genuinely having a good conversation with people. Iâ€™m down to talk to anyone (14+) so just hmu!!
