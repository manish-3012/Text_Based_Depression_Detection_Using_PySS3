I'm sorry I have a "friend" that decided to tell everyone about...a very personal thing. When I say to everyone I say in my family. My family doesn't know about it because they're toxic, and would just make fun of me and bring me back down.

So, here's what she was going to post here if she had enough karma:

"Title:u/DoggoCatLover is a lying bastard"

"She's not 13, she's still 12, and turning 13 in the 6th of this month

She's a lying snake, and I hope she burns in hell.

This is what you get for lying and for not giving me the answers to the math quiz

Reddit, do your thing and cancel her, downvote her to oblivion, people that live shouldn't be allowed on earth

Ps, u/DoggoCatLover, don't piss me off again"

She sent me this through my reddit dms (I have screenshots)

I hope you guys are able to forgive be and don't make this a big deal.... I just wanted to feel included in something, and with school off I decided to try it here.
