I'm 15 and so unlucky that I do not have a Girlfriend. In my friend circle everyone are engaged (dating a girl) but I'm an unlucky who is single [crying noises].
But that's fine I'm still 15 and there are many years for me to get an opportunity. I'm keeping my mind positive and I think others like me (single) should also be positive!
