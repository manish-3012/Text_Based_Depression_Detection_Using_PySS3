I legit see no value in my life I straight up see no value in my life

I dont know why i live it, im trans in a country in which its impossible to be trans putting my transition late in life which sucks as i have hyper masculine genes that make my body hyper masc meaning i wont pass. Also added the fact im hyper ugly and most of the time being ugly as a guy just makes me even uglier as a girl. My family is economically fucked. Im lonely, straight up no irl friendships or relationships or any true connections to a single person. I spend all days in my room either reading or just sleeping. I had to drop out of school because mental health and because i cant get mental help as its too expensive and my parents dont believe in bad mental health and see it as a weak trait im stuck like this. Because i dropped out i wont ever achieve shit in the world. Ive got no real talents or skills to make up for it and its too late to start anything. I just want to die.
