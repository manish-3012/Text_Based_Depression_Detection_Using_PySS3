I think im having a panic attack I think I'm having a panic attack, i managed to calm down a little, but my heart is still racing, and im having a heartburn, im sweating a little and my stomach hurts if i swallow help. I was eating a salmon, when i started to feel a slowly increasing heartburn, i stopped eating there, and now suddenly, it became intense, my heart is racing, im not calm at all, im sweating as fuck and whatnot, I've managed to calm down a little, but it's still intense, help me, im having these moments where i gag, followed by a wave of intense heartburn. And about fish, I've only had a reaction like this like 3 times before but they were much less intense, guys what should i do, i feel like immuna die. im sorry for bad wording,
