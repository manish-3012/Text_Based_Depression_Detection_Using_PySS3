I am confused So there is this girl on my bus that is really nice to me, and I donâ€™t t know if she is just being nice, using me for my hotspot, or likes me. She seems nice to all of the girls that ride my bus, and mean to a lot of the guys, but they deserve it, they are dumb assess, but she is nice to me for some reason, and I donâ€™t know If itâ€™s because I am not a dipshit, or what, but like once every couple of weeks sheâ€™ll ask me to use my hotspot on my phone, and I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s why she is being nice, or if she likes me. I thought she had a bf, but last time I heard about that was over a year ago, I have her number cos I asked a few years ago when we met up with mutual friends, and I lost a bet, and I asked her to play among us last week and she responded, so I know it still works. So I am confused, and I kinda like her, but I donâ€™t know what to do, and I donâ€™t wanna ask if she is single, because that seems a little creepy, and I donâ€™t know if she likes me back, but she is really nice to me.
