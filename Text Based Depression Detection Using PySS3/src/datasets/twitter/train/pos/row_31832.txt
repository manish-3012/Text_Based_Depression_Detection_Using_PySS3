Puberty check? (Boy) Iâ€™m 13 as u can see from my flair, Iâ€™m around the age most boys start puberty. Iâ€™ve been seeing signs of puberty and donâ€™t know everything thatâ€™s gonna happen, pubic hair is there, and in the recent weeks, Iâ€™ve had one massive growth spurt and am taller than my mother now, ( Iâ€™m still considered short at school lol) . My bones have been hurting and I havenâ€™t been able to do exercise for the last 2 weeks cause of what I assume is growing pains. My voice has gotten naturally deeper( not much) but my parents think Iâ€™m putting it one. Also this week Iâ€™ve had a very scratchy throat. If u read all that, thx
