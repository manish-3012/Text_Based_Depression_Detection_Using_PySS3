My ducking bros are the best I was deeply depressed because I had to go in quarantene. There was a covid case in my class.
Soo because i was really alone and wasn't able to talk to my family or my friends I really got depressed and thought about "things" that hurted me and I asked everything. I often 'overthink' things when I am alone and have much time. I also had a really bad time with my grades at the school and a crisis if I should just quit. 
My bros really worried and wanted to get me feel better. So they just talked about minecraft. Then they just bought me minecraft and rent a server to play and have a really really nice life together! I really love my bros. They helped me to stabilize again and stop my 'overthinking'! 
Love your bros! And love yourself! We can get out of every situation togeter!
