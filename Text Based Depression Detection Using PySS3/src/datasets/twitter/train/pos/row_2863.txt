Posting something I am greatful for for 7 days day 6 We are almost done! This has been great even though only five people will be seeing this. Anyway let's begin. I am greatful for the world we live on. I am greatful for the plants, the animals, the land, the mountains, the bodies of water, and whatever else I left out. Even though we won't see the entire world in our lifetimes it still it's a great place depending on where you look. Maybe there is a park in your area that would be nice to go to and enjoy. Honestly without the help of nature, we wouldn't be in this state.
