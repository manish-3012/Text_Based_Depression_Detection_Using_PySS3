What was your first job, and what can you say about it. Where would you recommend I work for my very first job? So I am 14 and Iâ€™m looking to get my first job here soon. I am a freshmen, but I am probably going to wait to get a job until after the quarantine ends, and everything is more normal. What would you recommend for a first job? I donâ€™t really have a primary place Iâ€™m looking at currently, so any recommendations help. :)
