Can anybody send me the most up to date video on all of FNAF lore? When I was younger I was obsessed with the lore of FNAF and would watch any video I could find about the lore. I later lost interest and now remember that those games had a pretty interesting story. Does anyone know of a video that covers all of the lore of games 1- however many games there are now? I know this is a dumb request but I would really like to know.
