I decided I'm finally going to use my PC to do what I got it for and have been downloading and updating steam for the last hour and a half... I haven't used my PC for much because I needed the monitor and mouse in order to do online school with my laptop using dual monitors shortly after it was repaired for being in a bootloop scince a month after I got it. I got a new monitor for Christmas and decided to use my PC again but with 2 monitors (though I need a vga cable in order to do that because it has 1 hdmi output). Because my internet is so slow my pc has only downloaded 85,132 kb of the steam updates out of 192,000 in the last hour and a half and I'm probably going to be up until 3 am by the time it finishes and I can actually use it
