Day 14 of me eating and excersizing properly so I can stop being a fat fuck etc except it's day 15 (also this is sorta turning into my gay transguy updates as well so enjoy ig) Yes I know it's day 15. I just woke up.

I did my shit as usual yesterday, not much really happened. I kinda just went about my day, did what I needed to, then wasted my life watching LGBTQ+ tiktoks like the gay ass degenerate I am. 

Nothing much more to add, really.

I guess there's that I didn't get outed in English because a shelf fell on the teacher and she didn't collect in our books. Don't ask me if that situation was good or not because I'm not sure.

Otherwise I think that's all.

Stay safe out there!
