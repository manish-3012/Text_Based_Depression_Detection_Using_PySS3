I finally came out to my parents So I came out to my parents i didn't have a cute cake or sit them down for a chat nope I started crying in the fish and chips drive-thru line my parents are your average catholic Mexican trump supporters and I am not a trump supporter for obvious reasons so I usually talk to my parents about politics and today I asked how they could support him even though hes treating lgbt people so horrible and my dad started saying how he doesn't hate the lgbt community but he doesn't support them so i couldn't take it anymore and started crying obviously my parents were super confused until they put two and two together and my mom asked me if I was gay so I decided to come out as bi my dad was honestly super supportive once he realized what bi meant my mom asked me how I knew and told me that its probably just a phase but she also told me that she loved me and that I'm still their daughter so yeah I'm still shocked that that happened and I feel like this is just a dream and I'm going to wake up any second now but I'm so grateful that my parents are okay with this
