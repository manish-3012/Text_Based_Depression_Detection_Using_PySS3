In another episode of â€œmy sister making remarks on my self care expecting it to not hurst me â€œ Why do they think making fun of how I treat myself is gonna make me feel I deserve better ,they are gonna bring food home and I donâ€™t want to pick it and all because Iâ€™m in old clothes and stuff and she didnâ€™t even asked she just ordered me to do and even tho I was already angry for her not even attempting to making me agree she close it with a â€œ they are not gonna smell you â€œ I do take a very poor care of myself, my hair is chopped and tangled , I have a lot of bruises and stuff like that but I havenâ€™t fell that deep to just stink, does she really think that making fun of me is gonna make me feel better, my sister is my favorite person in the family the only one that sometimes treats me decent and it hurts I just feel disgusting, so disgusted of myself 

( she just came in my room and guilted me for not wanting go pick the food, she is always guiltripping me for everything and the thing that annoys me is she always makes me feel like I do nothing for her but I give anything to her , I cook when she asks I go pick her things I do everything and she stills mekes me feel so gross )
