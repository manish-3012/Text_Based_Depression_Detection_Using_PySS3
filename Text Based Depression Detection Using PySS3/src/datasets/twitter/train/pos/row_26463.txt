I dont know what to do Yesterday, I rolled a plan sheet of paper and lit it as a joke. But when no one was looking I just sucked some of it in. I didnt inhale it, I just kept it in my mouth. I want to try it again but I'm scared I'll do it again and again and I'll get addicted. What can I do to get my mind off it and forget it happened?
I'm 13 btw
