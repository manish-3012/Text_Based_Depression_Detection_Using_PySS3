I have an idea and I need your guyâ€™s support. I sincerely think itâ€™s worth the read. Iâ€™m not in anyway without friends thereâ€™s a lot of times Iâ€™ve been without anyone to talk to aitana problems so I kind of want to just send a snap to everyone I have added just seeing how you doing how are you feeling but I donâ€™t know how without sounding intrusive or nine, and thereâ€™s a lot of people who would just ignore something. I want to reach out to people just want to talk to someone just do my best to have a helpful conversation into them and maybe just makes him smile. Do you want to lose because I know thereâ€™s probably someone I know just want to talk to Someone because Iâ€™ve been there. I donâ€™t know if I should do this but nothing is I donâ€™t just want to do it and hope one person I want as many people are more in a make someoneâ€™s day to do it even if you canâ€™t antisocial because who knows you might just make a few friends and you donâ€™t have anything to lose by just trying to be friendly. 

If anyone has any ideas of how to do this in the best sounding way, leave them below and if you end up doing it please let me know.
