I need some help- can any trans (especially non-binary but binary trans people Iâ€™d appreciate input from aswell) whoâ€™ve come out fully publicly tell me about it? Iâ€™m not exactly asking for coming out tips- Iâ€™ve heard a lot of the same ones; donâ€™t rush yourself, respect your boundaries, practice coming out, what Iâ€™m asking is how do people even come out publicly. Did you just wear a pronoun pin one day? Did you tell all your teachers? Did you walk around the halls to spread the word to as many people as possible? Did you just talk to friends? And, if youâ€™ve come out, how well did it go? Do most people still just see you as your AGAB? Do people misgender you out of spite or because they never heard/forgot? It would really help to hear someoneâ€™s story.
