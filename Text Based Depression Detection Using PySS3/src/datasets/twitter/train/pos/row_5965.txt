Left her on read and I feel so liberated So Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for like a year now, a whole year of just cat and mouse. It feels like sheâ€™s been leading me on but I was too stupid to realize this until now

Sheâ€™d tell me things like â€œ I wish I had a boyfriend like youâ€ and â€œhow are you singleâ€ etc.   and I just gave in to her, I always felt like I was getting closer and closer to actually being her boyfriend but Iâ€™d always get set back with a â€œnooooo heâ€™s just a friendâ€ or a â€œhey bestieâ€.

But no more.

Iâ€™m tired of entertaining this girl, she knows I like her but everytime I try to speak on it she avoids the conversation and I know that sounds like an obvious sign to some of you but she always says things to keep me attached.

I got tired of waiting for something different to happen, so I left her good morning text on read and removed her from social media because I hate stereotypical gender roles.
