My teacher just gave me an A+ in animation class In our class, there's that one quarter of our year where technology class turns into animation class, and we're supposed to do it in Blender.

Because I didn't have Blender, and I didn't listen since I was playing TF2 everytime, I basically made medium-res models and made a 40-min video on SFM for our final project before it turns into networking class.

But the teacher said that anyome using NOT Blender will get a penalty. But I didn't care. I started the project anyways. November until yesterday, I worked on the project.

I finished the work yesterday, and with hard-work wasted, the teacher straight up said this to me:

"Animation takes skill, and you don't have one skill. But you got guts, kid. Your teammates are only looking on the side I gave them, but you looked in the other direction. I'm not going to give you a penalty, but I'm giving you an A+ for making my day.

- Sincerely, A Soldier main"

Bruh then the teacher wanted to play with me for a while and I did. 

Worth it.
