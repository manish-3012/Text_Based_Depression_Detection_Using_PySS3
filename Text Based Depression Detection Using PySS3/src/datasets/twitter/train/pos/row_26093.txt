difference between rubbing it in that your gay and just talking about it yea im just gunna talk about this feel free to add in your own opinions. 

a lot of people complane about gay people rubbing that fact that they are gay in their faces. the problem is is that they might just be talking about their experience, just came out of the closet, there is someone else there that is closeted. 

Being lgbt+ effects a lot more then who you love. It effects your friend groups, jobs, and family. Depending on where you are at it can add to stress due to homophobia. If a kid comes out to their parents there is a risk of being abuses, thrown out and more. So when they come out of the closet and their parents except it they might talk about it a lot and they might act on it a lot. 

also when they first figure it out they might be all about it because there is still a fear of am i really who i think i am? so they might act a lot like that to inshure them and the community that they are infact a part of it. 

if there is someone else that is closeted they might be talking a lot about it to let the other person know that is it ok. 

people also tend to notice when people talk about being lgbt+ then when they talk about being straight.
