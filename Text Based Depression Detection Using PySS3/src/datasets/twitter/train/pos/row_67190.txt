I donâ€™t necessarily know where to rant so ig Iâ€™ll rant here Mother fucking hell. Iâ€™ve never really been â€œdepressedâ€ before now. Sure I got sad sometimes but until quarantine I never felt the way I do now. Nothing has any fucking meaning anymore. Iâ€™ve lost all hope and even the fact that my school will be doing a hybrid in person thing isnâ€™t able to bring me out of it. This quarter I havenâ€™t done a fucking single assignment and itâ€™s going on three weeks tomorrow. I have Fs in all my classes because I just canâ€™t fucking do them. I have no motivation whatsoever. The only sliver of joy Iâ€™ve found in the past few weeks is playing minecraft on a realm me and all my friends started. But even with that, afterwards Iâ€™m just thrown into a depressive slump again. I know that some of you might be going through this as well and fuck man Iâ€™m sorry. 

The other day was the first time Iâ€™ve ever legitimately considered suicide. The next morning I immediately dropped it and though better, but that fact is that I thought about it and that fucking scares me. What if one day I donâ€™t shake it off? All these school assignments getting thrown at me have no value. None of the classes iâ€™m in right now are based on subjects iâ€™m interested in or want to make a career out of. And the one class I usually always really enjoy(history) has just lost all its charm. I canâ€™t fucking take this anymore.

And my parents donâ€™t help the situation either. Before quarantine I basically had free rane on my phone and how much I could talk to my friends and girlfriend. Then after quarantine my parents decided that it wasnâ€™t cool to do that so I had to start turning my phone in every night. Ever since theyâ€™ve been putting more and more restrictions on the only shit I like to do. Iâ€™ve talked to them about it and tried to work something out but they wonâ€™t fucking listen. I feel so isolated and alone because of them and what theyâ€™re doing. I wonâ€™t go into anymore detail on what theyâ€™ve done but yeah. 

So yeah thatâ€™s pretty much it. Iâ€™m at my fucking limit and I know some of you might be too. Just hmu if you need any fucking person to talk to. Ik how lonely this can all feel and I wanna help you and iâ€™m the process you can help me. Thank for listening to my ted talk.
