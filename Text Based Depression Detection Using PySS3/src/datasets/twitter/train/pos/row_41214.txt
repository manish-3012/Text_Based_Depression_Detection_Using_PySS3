I used to hate trans boys but now kinda like them Like I mostly have crushes on trans boys who are pre surgery and haven't been changed much by testosterone yet. Which is kinda wack. I'm a trans girl (questioning) and testosterone is just so disgusting to me, I hate it and it's ruined my body. 

If it makes someone else happy tho that's great. But it really depends if I'd date a trans guy like they'd still have to look feminine. Because even with cis guys I like fem looking ones.
