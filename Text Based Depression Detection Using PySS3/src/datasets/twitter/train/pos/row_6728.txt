You probably don't care but- You probably don't care but I just wanted to share this. I never told anyone this so this is why I'm doing it here anonymously, so here it goes. I have been feeling really bad lately, not depression vise, but I just, didn't like myself. But now, even though I still don't love myself I realized that I don't hate myself anymore. Again, you probably don't care but I'm just really happy about this.
