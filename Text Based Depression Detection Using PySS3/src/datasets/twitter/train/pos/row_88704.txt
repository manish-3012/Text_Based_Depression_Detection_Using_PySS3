Day 38 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. â™†: Sorry, I lied. But you should have known better.

â™†: You kids are trying so hard to be good.

â™†: And I guess I don't want you to.

â™†: Doesn't it feel unfair?

â™†: You're already good, so why do you have to try so hard to be good?

â™†: It makes me mad.

â™†: They want you to prove you're good. But you're already so good.

â™†: What is that? Why do they do that?

â™†: Why did they think I wouldn't notice that? That it should so obviously be me. That it should so obviously be you.

â™†: It makes me so, so mad.

â™†: I hate this place so much.

â™†: Why are either of you here?

â™†: Why do we have to be here?

â™ƒ: Please stop. Please. Please stop.

â™ƒ: Let's just. We don't. It doesn't.

â™†: God just stoppppp. Please. I hate this.

â™†: I am trying to fuck up Venus for the rest of his entire life and you too if you let me and if you want to stop that I guess there is a problem and you will have to kill me.

â™†: Does that kid look happy to you? Well I guess we have different opinions and you will have to stop me from making him into what he is trying very hard not to be.

â™†: And Jupiter I want to do the same to you so badly. So, so badly.

â™ƒ: Pleaseâ€”

â™†: No.

â™†: I don't want to be good ever.

â™†: And neither of you should want to be good either.
