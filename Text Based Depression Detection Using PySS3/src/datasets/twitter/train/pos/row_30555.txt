The problem with rejection It puts pressure on you. You get rejected by one girl, she is gonna live rent free in your head till you meet a better one and get rejected by her too. You are basically trapped with your rejections in your head and you cannot really do anything to escape it. It will haunt you forever. It teaches you nothing besides the fact that trying will lead to pain.
