Iâ€™m such a klutz I swear, sometimes I have two left feet, because I was walking down the stairs, and like three steps from the bottom, my foot caught on one of my youngest sisterâ€™s dumb toys and like my right leg kinda just twisted as my other leg went straight in front of me???

Donâ€™t worry, my legs not broken or anything. Iâ€™m just in a lot of pain :) 

Moral of the story: donâ€™t be a klutz like me. Also, clean your fucking stairs!!!!
