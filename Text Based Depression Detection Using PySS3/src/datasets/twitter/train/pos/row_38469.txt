I'm starting to miss Google clasroom.... So at first I thought it was cool to use the new thig edgenuity......its this thing there using at school.......if your behind it can tell you how long it would take to catch up.........I thought it was cool at first cause I could do two classes one day and two other classes the other,well I did that......now I'm gonna have to spend around 8 hours to catch up on the elective classes.......not even core classes.........makes sense
