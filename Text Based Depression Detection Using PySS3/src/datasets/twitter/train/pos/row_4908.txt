I fucked up bad and maybe ruined a relationship I went too far. I was talking to my friend on discord about a recent breakup and usually, when I take the piss he's fine. But I went too far this time, he left the comp match that we were playing and left the discord call without saying a word. I'm genuinely sorry, but idk how to make it up for him.
