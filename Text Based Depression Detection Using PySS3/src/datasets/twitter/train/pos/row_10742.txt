I have to take a 3 hour flight tomorrow and i must wake up at 4:00 am. I will lose 2 hours since timezone and daylight saving. Do i sleep earlier or sleep later to sleep on the flight? If i go to bed at 11:30 that will make it so i get just enough sleep by sleeping on plane

Otherwise I will be bored
