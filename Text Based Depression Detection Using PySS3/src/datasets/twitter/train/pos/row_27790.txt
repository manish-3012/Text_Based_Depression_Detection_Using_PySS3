The most humiliating moment of my life. So earlier this year, I was hanging out with my friend during lunch. It was just me and him at the table that day because the two other people who usually sat with us had to retake a test they missed. Anyways, my friend gets up from the table to get some more food from the cafeteria. So I was sitting by myself for a couple of minutes.

While he was gone, two of the hottest girls at the school ask me if they could sit with me. As you would expect, I get super nervous that this is actually happening. I have absolutely no idea why they're doing this, but man am I enjoying it.

They then both ask what my name is, what classes I'm in, the usual stuff. It's mostly the hotter girl of the two asking the questions though. At this point, my irrational thinking mind is thinking that she is about to become my girlfriend. So I start asking her what she does for fun and things of that sort. She tells me that she enjoys hiking a lot.

Before I can ask her anymore questions, my friend returns to the table. As he's walking back, the girl who was asking me all the questions says, "Damn, he's hot as fuck. Do you know him? I'd love to get his number."

I told them that I knew him, but didn't know his number. (I actually didn't yet, I'd only know him for a few weeks and only had his Snap) 

Both of the girls then left the table before my friend could talk to them. I then told my friend when he got back to table that I was feeling sick and needed to go to the bathroom. I stayed in there for the next 25 minutes until my next class with teary eyes.
