I GOT MY YEARLY COMPLIMENT So, I practiced my handwriting (which my neighbour teaches me). She had went out of house when I went to her house to show her what I had written. However, there was her daughter there (who is 2 years younger than me and we had some "things" between us and broke up).

And because she is also very experienced in the handwriting stuff 'cause of her mum, I asked her if what I had written looked good or not. She looked at it, smiled (which she rarely does while talking to me), and said in a soft but calming and satisfying voice,"It looks good". 

It genuinely made my day
