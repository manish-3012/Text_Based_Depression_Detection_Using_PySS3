I'm so full of hate and anger I think I'm unable to feel sad, love or any feeling really. I mean throughout my life I've have experienced that have reached me not to care about others, and I've gradually became more and more of a distant and cold dude. It's not like I feel bad or care. It's just something I wanted to share. I just can't feel other's pain. I can't feel what other feel. It's like a defense system I've gotten since no one cared about me.
