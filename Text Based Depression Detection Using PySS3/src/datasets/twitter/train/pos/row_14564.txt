my sibling (non binary) thinks im a nazi in training and brainwashed and racist and this and that because i use reddit i literally love reddit, i dont understand why people think its evil. its literally just people coming together, having discussions, sharing interests, having fun, and hanging out. i understand that theres dark and scary parts of the internet, and that reddit has been linked to them before, but not the entire platform is pedophilic drug dealing murderers. I feel pretty offended. my time on the internet is spent looking at guitar videos, disc golf, music, and memes. : /
