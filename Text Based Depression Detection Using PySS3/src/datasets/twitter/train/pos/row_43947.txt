What should I say? My crush sometimes tells me that she is ugly, and I tell her that she is wrong. But now she has started to say â€œThose guys where staring at me, maybe because I am so beautifulâ€

What does it mean, and what should I do/say? I donâ€™t feel any jealous, I just donâ€™t know what she wants me to do.
