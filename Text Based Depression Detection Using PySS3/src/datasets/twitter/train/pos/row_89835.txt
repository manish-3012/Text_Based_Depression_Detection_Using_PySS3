To everyone who is still single and trying to get a relationship: Donâ€™t try force yourself into a relationship, if you force it then youâ€™ll have a terrible relationship with someone who doesnâ€™t care about you.

Also, if you really like someone and you know for a fact that you like them, just ask them out. Honestly, if theyâ€™re a dick about it then they werenâ€™t the one anyway.
