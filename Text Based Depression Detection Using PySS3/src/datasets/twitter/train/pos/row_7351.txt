What are the best apps for school? Hey fellow teenagers,

with the school coming, and me being in an ipad class, I'm starting to get prepared.

I already done 2 years so I know the basic apps (drive, evertnote, google docs, photomath and so on)

I was wondering if you had any particular apps that can help studying or taking notes.

being my tablet an iPad they have to be for iOS tho :(

thanks in advance
