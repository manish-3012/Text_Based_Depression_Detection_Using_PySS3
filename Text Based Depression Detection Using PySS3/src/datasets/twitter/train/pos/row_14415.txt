I canâ€™t believe this shit This may sound like one of them cliche storyâ€™s but Iâ€™m am not lying.

Before I write this my dad basically has a massive family and his brother got up to a lot of stuff with many women.

This girl adds me on snap I know who she is vaguely (she goes to another school close to mine) and we actually chat for a few days sending full face pics and everything. She would always reply back really fast. I donâ€™t talk to many girls anymore and I was actually enjoying talking to her and possibly beginning to like her.


She then tells me we are related, I checked with my mum and dad and turns out we most definitely are. The first thing my dad said was she has my aunts face ( I never see her so I wouldnâ€™t know.) I am gutted and she apologised for just throwing it at me like that but man my fucking luck. This sucks
