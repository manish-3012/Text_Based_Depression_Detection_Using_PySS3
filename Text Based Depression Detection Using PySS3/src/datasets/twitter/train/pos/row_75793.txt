i love it when my friend texts to update me on the people sheâ€™s been talking to

after completely ignoring my previous texts

which were related to a conversation we were having 

from 3 days ago 


like if youâ€™re going to leave me on delivered for 3 days when we were in the middle of a conversation then donâ€™t get fucking butthurt when i respond with dry shit
