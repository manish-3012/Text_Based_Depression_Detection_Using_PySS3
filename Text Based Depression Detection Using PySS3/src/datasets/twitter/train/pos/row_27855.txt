So im supposed to be having a girl over in a few days. What are the chances sheâ€™ll flake on me? So this girl slid into my dms a few days ago, told me i was cute and all that shit. We started talking for a bit then i invited her to a group chat with me and my friends to play some games. We flirted and stuff, and then i said something and she told me to shut up (in a flirty way) and i was like make me, then she said â€œok bet let me know when ðŸ™ƒâ€, so then i was like if youâ€™re not busy next week ill let you know, she said bet.

I texted her solo an hour later and the conversation went exactly like this:

Me: what are you doing this weekend? Tryna come over and watch a movie or something?

Her: Yea... for sure

Me: Saturday then?

Her: yea

Me: bet

Then i was left on read. We talked a day later but it was minor stuff nothing much. But i have a feeling just from that response that sheâ€™s not really with it and im scared she just might not end up coming Saturday. Idk what do you guys think?
