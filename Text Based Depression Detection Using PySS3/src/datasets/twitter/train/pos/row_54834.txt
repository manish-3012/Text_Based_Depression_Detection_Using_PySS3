Wow I canâ€™t believe this I was telling my dad how the cops beat up a disabled black man in a wheelchair and his response is,â€ you think the cops arenâ€™t getting punished and if they get rid of the cops then who are you going to call when you need help?â€ So basically he completely disregarded the fact that the cops beat up a disabled black man in a fucking wheelchair. I swear to god where has humanity gone. And if the the cops were getting â€œpunishedâ€ then there would be no protesting and the protests wouldnâ€™t have gone on for the 50+ days thatâ€™s itâ€™s been going on. I swear trump followers are basically a cult at this point
