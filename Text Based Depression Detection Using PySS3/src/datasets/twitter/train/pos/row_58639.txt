I am failing school This might not be the right place to write this but I just kinda have to rant and I would really appreciate any advice/your stories if you went through the same thing. 

I was always considered to be the smart kid. I had good grades, I understood every subject almost instantly and learned stuff very quickly. I am in the first year of highschool now and we have had online school for almost the whole year. My grades are dropping drastically and I've lost every single bit of motivation I had for studying. I am almost failing my math class (I've always been good at maths) my biology class and many others. I've had many breakdowns because of school and it's only getting worse. I am also dealing with some mental health problems but I won't get into that. I came into a class full of smart kids that are getting A's in every subject and I pretty much feel like shit. 

The thing is that I know I could be doing so much better but I just can't. Every time I sit down to study I fall asleep after an hour even if it's 3 pm. I can barely do my homework on time and after that I feel so drained that I can't do anything else. There's so much information that my head can't comprehend. I feel so stupid all the time, I can't pay attention to what the teacher is saying because my brain feels like a black hole. I also partially don't want to study because if I do it makes me feel dumb because I didn't already understand the subject in class. I am very scared of dissapoiting my parents. This is supposed to be the easiest year of highschool and I'm here giving up.
