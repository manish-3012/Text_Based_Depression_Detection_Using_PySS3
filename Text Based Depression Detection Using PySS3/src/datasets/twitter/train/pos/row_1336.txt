i dont feel like i am boyfriend material. lets just open with the cliche, as the title says i dont feel like boyfriend material.

And i think this because: I just got out of my first relation and i am back to having to no friends again.

And during that relationship i had some trouble talking about some small problems we had.

Also i think i am very clingy because i didnt like her going around with other boys but since i am a very quiet person i didnt say anything about it.

Also i think that when i reach the age to have sex i dont think i can do like dirty talk and stuff. Maybe this is just something that has been fed to by porn but i dont know since i am only 14.

Also im a huge doubter and over thinker. Because every time my girlfriend acted off my  mind would start racing and shit.

Also dont think i can prioritize a girlfriend above my usual activities like gaming, consuming content on youtube and school.

Also i am sure that i am not attractive. yeah you can say: but you had a girlfriend, but i have to things against that: 1. Around a year ago we went on a school trip and on the way back some guys were asking some hot girl who she would date. And then they said my name. And she just like yelled: ewwwww. 2. The friends of my ex were ask her all the time how she could like me.

i will probably add some things later because i really need to some school work now
