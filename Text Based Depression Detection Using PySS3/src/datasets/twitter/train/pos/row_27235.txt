So I know this is gonna sound stupid but can you guys help me decide what I want for Christmas? My best friend is asking me what I want and I honestly don't know. I'm into nerdy things like D&amp;D, I'm into electronics (as in making the actual circuits), I'm into build computers, but I don't want to ask for computer parts as those can get expensive and I don't want her to spend too much money on me.

I'd ask her for Tasha's cauldron to everything, but one my friends is gonna try to get me that. I really suck to get gifts for because I typically don't know what I want that's not too expensive.
