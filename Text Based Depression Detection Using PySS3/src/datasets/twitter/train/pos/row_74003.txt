Does anyone wanna join our chill little discord server? Hey, we've had a small, yet active, discord server for over 2 years now, but we're looking for a few more people.  We have a bunch of stuff to do (including just regular chatting of course) such as a channel for programming help, a channel for talking about crypto trading, one for debating, politics, and philosophical discussions, and we also have semi regular jam seshes where we all just listen to music and vibe :).  If you're interested and will be able to remain at least somewhat active, send me a dm so I can send you the link to the server :).
