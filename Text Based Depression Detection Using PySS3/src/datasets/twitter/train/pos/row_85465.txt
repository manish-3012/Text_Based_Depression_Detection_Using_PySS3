Dnd concept character. Kobold oathbreaker Basically this kobold was the highest ranking paladin to his dragon. The dragon was evil and made him do horrible things. But since he was an oath to the crown and she was his queen, he did order without question.

One day on a quest for more valuables to add to her majesty's hoard, he stumbled into the feywild. Falling down a step cliff and into the river. Then flung off a water fall into a big lake. While unconconous he trips the fuck out and has vision. He wakes up on the bank coughing up water, and realised from the visions how evil his queen was. He stumbles as he gets up and face plants and passes out again. Later waking up in an unfamiliar cave only alittle in.

He now wanders the world in search of his new purpose with a hatred for evil dragons, and a heart filled with regret and sorrow
