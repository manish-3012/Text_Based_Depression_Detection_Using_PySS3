Please try to read this (if not, cool) Hi, Iâ€™ve been on this subreddit long enough to know that if you ask some help on how to get a girl to like you, that wonâ€™t happen. So, Iâ€™m asking people of experience for some help asking out a girl the I have liked for quite a long time. If you have any suggestions or ways to maybe help with boosting up my confidence, that would be great.

Thank you
