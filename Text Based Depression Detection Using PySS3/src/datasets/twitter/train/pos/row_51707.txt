Who else would say they donâ€™t feel as confident as they used to? Iâ€™m only 14 but I look back and cringe at some of the stuff I said when I was like 10-12 or whatever. I was having a shower thought and it made me realise that back then, Iâ€™d be saying whatever I want to say, to whoever I want and not really think about it. So I basically had the confidence to make jokes in front of the class, no matter how shit or cringey they were and how no one would laugh at them. But now I only really talk to my friends and not really anyone else. Iâ€™m not saying I have 0 confidence but since starting secondary school (basically high school we just call it different in UK) my confidence has definitely gone down.
