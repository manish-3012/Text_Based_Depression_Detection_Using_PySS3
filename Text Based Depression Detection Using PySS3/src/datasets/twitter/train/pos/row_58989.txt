I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY DREAMS ARE ANYMORE SVSVSGSGAV It started off ok; I was playing Minecraft and there were actually some Dreamteam members so I was really excited to play. 

Then all of a sudden I'm in my house, but it's March. I'm happy as that means my dog (who recently passed two weeks ago) is alive. So I pick him up and head outside of my house to see a car on the front lawn/gravely area AND A FLOATING RED FISH TRYING TO BREAK INTO IT.

Very confused, I go to Reddit only for someone to have posted about a fish trying to break into their car. I go back inside to grab my phone (even though I already had it?) to take a photo of the fish. I see it in the car, using its nose(?)/front to boop this touchscreen to change the settings in the car but it floats off before I could get a photo.

I'm then inside my house again, lying on my sofa. My mom can't find something (I think it was her phone but part of me thinks it was chicken nuggets??) i see it and shout for her. Turns out I also shouted irl and my dad came through to ask what was wrong. I vaguely remember saying "Moms..lost her..phone (/mcnuggets)".
