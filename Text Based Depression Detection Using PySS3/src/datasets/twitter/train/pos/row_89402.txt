I think that unnecessarily harsh/rude people arenâ€™t that funny Its not like it really... hurts anyone I guess? I think most people are definitely able to tell that theyâ€™re joking!


But it just seems a bit cringy. Like it always seems as though theyâ€™re tryin to be quirky. It seems like theyâ€™re trying too hard to have a defining trait. I just think its odd to blast people with insults to be funny. Does anyone else feel this way? Iâ€™m assuming so
