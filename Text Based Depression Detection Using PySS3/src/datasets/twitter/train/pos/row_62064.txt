Hi everyone sorting by new. Do you have any tips on making new friends.
Its not that I hate the 2 friends i have at the moment, its just that I'm very lonely (also a bit shy to talk with new people) and my friends never ask to do something together, it sometimes feels like nothing happened unless I'm the one to ask if they want to do something and that is starting to absolutely kill me with depression (because I'm not that good at asking if they want to do something, so I'm not that often hanging out with someone).

So any tips on getting new/more friends?

Sry if my English is bad, it's my second language.
