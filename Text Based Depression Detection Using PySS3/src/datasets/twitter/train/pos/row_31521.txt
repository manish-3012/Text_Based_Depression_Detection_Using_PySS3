Finally accepted that I am feeling suicidal and admitted it to my parents Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression for all of my teenage years, and today I finally admitted to myself that I think of suicide a lot and broke down to my parents. Just wanted to share this here because I know you all have your own struggles and maybe if we share them together then we can all feel a little less alone. Stay safe friends &lt;3
