I made a song. I made a song using nothing but garage band loops. It is called DeltaChill and is made by my music-making name, (Hazardous music). I haven't licensed it yet. I'll probably license it with NCS. But I thought I'd ask you guys if you want to hear a preview of it. This is a r/teenagers exclusive opportunity. Comment if you want to hear it.
