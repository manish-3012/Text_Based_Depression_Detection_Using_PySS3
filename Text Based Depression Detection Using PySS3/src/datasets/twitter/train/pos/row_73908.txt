Hahaha fake internet points go brrrrrrrrrr THANKS SO MUCH FOR GETTING ME NUMBER 1 ON HOT!!!!! Like seriously i did not expect my post to blow up. I was shocked to see it when I got on Reddit, and this is the first time I've reached hot on a sub like this. My fake internet points went up, so thanks homies. I'm not trying to be an internet points whore, but I've been having a pretty shitty week, and this actually made my day.

I've seen enough. I'm satisfied.
