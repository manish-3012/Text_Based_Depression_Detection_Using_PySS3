Who here rides horses? Any type of riding Western , English , Bareback or just fuckung around. Now what was your worst fall? Mine was a near concussion when I was 7. I was riding bareback no helmet , like fucking eijit , and I whip to hard on the pony and off she goes like a bullet and jumps over a2 drills of spuds, and I go flying. My friend had to drag me over to the creek. And to make it worse we weren't supposed to be riding there so I had to keep my gob shut.
