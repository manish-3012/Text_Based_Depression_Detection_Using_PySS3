Being alone for god knows why Hello there gamers and gamers without weens. 

I'm sorry if this is grammatically inaccurate because I'm  german and we don't learn that much in school lol. Anyways. Recently all my friends kinda left me and the only person that still listens and talks to me lives in 'murica.

Lets just call her "she". I love her and she tells me the same (No "she" isnt a 50 year old p-man looking for young children smh.). We already talked on Discord and are throwing snaps at each other the whole day. She's cute, loving and overall pretty gaming. My dreams are with and about her, I constantly think about her and really want to meet her irl.

Totally lost track there hehe. Back to the topic; my "friends" started playing games without me, setting their status on Discord and Steam to busy whenever I come online,  I got kicked from my favourite discord server for no reason at all and am basically alone now. Since "she" lives in the US we can't play and have a bad time talking over discord with cutting out mid-sentence. I don't know what to do now. How am I suppose to live like that? My mom is the only person I talk to irl and even thats just small talk about the day. Not saying I was the Popular guy in school but I was the guy everyone was okay with and I dont understand how everyone turns against me.
