Dogs arenâ€™t better than people, they are just easier to love Ok just to be clear I do have a dog and I love him to death so please donâ€™t be angry with me.
But itâ€™s been a common joke to say â€œdogs are better than peopleâ€ but Iâ€™m really starting to feel that some people believe it. I see where they are coming from; dogs will be your friend pretty much unconditionally and they will never say anything hurtful because they physically cannot. Loving a dog is just so easy, they are just so cute and friendly. But easier does not always mean better. People can be nearly impossible to love; they can say mean stuff, they can lie, and they arenâ€™t nearly as cute. But this makes it all the more rewarding when you meet someone fantastic, or when you find something good in someone who didnâ€™t seem so fantastic at first. The one hardest thing about loving people is when you love someone who probably doesnâ€™t deserve it, Iâ€™ve had friends whoâ€™ve verbally and physically abused me who I refused to give up on, even if they never apologized or even acknowledged what they did. People are just so complicated, if everyone was just 100% a jerk then it would actually be easier, but itâ€™s not all black and white; people can hurt you because you see someone who has great qualities be dragged down by one or two mean tendencies. No matter what though sometimes you do need time away from other humans, they can get tiring. For when that happens, dogs are perfect. Dogs are better for certain moments. But in the end, love for and from humans does feel much more real and earned.
