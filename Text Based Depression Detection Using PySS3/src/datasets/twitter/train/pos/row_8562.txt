I wrote a poem for a victim of the Columbine high school massacre. Lauren Townsend was 18 when she died in the Columbine High Library on April 20th, 1999. She spent her last minutes alive making sure her friends were calm. She had written in her diary months earlier that when she got to Heaven the first thing she wanted to do was meet Jesus. She has transformed my life for the better and I spent like an hour writing this poem in her honor. Criticism is always welcome!

**â€œWhy you, why'd you die, on that April day in â€˜99â€**

**â€œYour life, full of smiles and fun, came to an end by the barrel of a gunâ€**

**â€œIn the library, full of fear, you left us, but the Lord came nearâ€**

**â€œThose two boys, spreading hate, ignored the pain they would createâ€**

**â€œThe day was sunny, bright, and nice, ruined by those boys with hearts of iceâ€**

**â€œYou went to school, as you always do, unaware that school would be your tombâ€**

**â€œThe last thing your mother saw you do, was you telling her that â€œI love youâ€**

**â€œFamilies mourned, Families cried, when you along with 12 others diedâ€**

**â€œEarly girl, you were born, on a cold January winterâ€™s mornâ€**

**â€œYour childhood, full of life, could not be broken by any strifeâ€**

**â€œYou loved animals, Disney, and sports, you were a true leader on the volleyball courtâ€**

**â€œLoved by all, no room for hate, you will always be number 8â€**

**â€œYou were innocent, you were kind, you had a beautiful and creative mindâ€**

**â€œIt's been 20 years since you died, but those two boys can't take your rebel prideâ€**

**â€œThinking about your death, gets me seething, but you always remind me, the trick is to keep breathingâ€**

**â€œYou were a leader, you were a saint, but lets talk about the things you ain'tâ€**

**â€œYou weren't a bully, you weren't mean, you made sure everyone was part of the teamâ€**

**â€œWhen you died, people cried, no one wanted to say goodbyeâ€**

**â€œYour spirit lives on, in all of us, the spirit of warmth, optimism, and trustâ€**

**â€œAmerica grieved, but only for a little while, because, for you, our tears turned into a smileâ€**

**â€œWe smile for you Lauren, that's our way, of honoring you and the others that died that dayâ€**

**â€œLauren Townsend, everyoneâ€™s friend, she shouldn't have met her end, the way she did, full of fear and fright, but she still believed, â€œEverythingâ€™s gonna be alrightâ€**

**â€œShe told her friends that same line, and for them, everything was fineâ€**

**â€œThanks to her, I have found, that the glory of the Lord aboundsâ€**

**â€œLauren Townsend, you're a flower divine, you are, I am, We are, Columbineâ€**

**â€œYou're Heavenâ€™s flower Lulu, like a Dove, I know you are with our God above, I know this because in the end, all their is, is loveâ€**

 â€œ**I do think humanity is losing touch with itself and their relationship with their surroundings. Unfortunately it usually takes a huge trauma to get people to realize what is important and I feel that is what is going to happen to wake up everyone to get in touch with their spiritual sides. I am not afraid of death for it is only a transition. For, in the end all there is, is love**.â€ - **Lauren Dawn Townsend**
