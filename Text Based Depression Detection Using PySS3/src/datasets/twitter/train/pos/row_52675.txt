How do I turn my life around? Hello, 
I'm 16 and I've been struggling with my life for the past 3 years. This started with a horrible relationship I could not get out of and it almost led me to take my life. We're still friends, though I don't like meeting her whatsoever, but if I wanted to leave her alone I'd feel guilty.
My grades in school went down significantly. My teachers who were so surprised tried to help me by giving me many chances to correct my grades, but I could never get motivated enough to study, because of how depressed I was feeling. I never told anyone about my health. I kept it in myself and that's the worst decision of mine that year.
My friends. While I don't have many of them, the ones I have are the people I appreciate a lot. They are always there for me, but I just wish I had the will to trust and tell my feelings to more people.
In the beginning of this school year a lot of stuff happened I never expected. I tried leaving the girl I was in a horrible relationship and it ended in tears, which then led to me apologising instead of her. In offline school I was doing really good and almost all of my grades were As which felt amazing. I also got a new soulmate I could talk with. Playing the guitar made me feel great too. It almost felt like my life was slowly coming together.
Online school came and I'm doing horrible. Worst grades I've ever had, relationships all over the place, very few friends to talk with and I'm really close to committing suicide. It's getting harder to get out of bed every single day and I really need help.
The question is in the title. Please be nice in the comments.
