Some advice of mine for y'all Dear teens,

Life may be full of insecurities, injustice and difficulties, and what do i know, i'm 16, but i'm telling you: do not look at sadness as a negative feeling. Instead, try to imagine it as the other side of the coin. Both happiness and sadness exist for a reason. They balance out. The biggest error you can commit is thinking that our purpuose in life is to be happy. Sometimes, feeling real sad is what should make you feel alive.
