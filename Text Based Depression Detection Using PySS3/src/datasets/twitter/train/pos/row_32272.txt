My fat ass is going to be running track. A coach told my that I should, well he more phrased it like it wasn't an option. But he's not my coach so that don't really matter. But I'm still going to do it. I need the credit anyway. I better not lose too much muscle. I need to get faster and lose fat, not muscle.
