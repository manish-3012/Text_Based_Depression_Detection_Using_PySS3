I cant fucking compete with these people So im from a family thats decent well off, not talking about millions but still okay.

I mean like i know so many kids that can just go like, â€œmom i want these â‚¬400 jordans pleaseâ€ and they always get them as example. Also girls that expect me as the guy to buy expensive gifts.

I applied to a job and am still waiting but i feel fucking ashamed that i need to do that job for money and they can just ask their parents and always get what they want.

Am i jelous. Yes and no, they are lucky that they get everything they want but i just want to be the same.

Also, i am extremely insecure about my looks and needing money doesnt make it better.

I will do the job if possible, it earns around 200 a month but thats still not enough to stay on the same level as the other kids.

Maybe u find me spoiled and so, thats prob true but im just not happy, sorry if you feel offended.

I hope ill get and very good paying job in the future and then my problems are gone.

Bye.
