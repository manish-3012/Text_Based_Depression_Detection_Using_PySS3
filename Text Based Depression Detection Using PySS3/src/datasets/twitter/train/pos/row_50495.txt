I had the opportunity to not only meet Jonathan Groff; but also be part of the cast in a show that he was in.  

(This is mainly me hating on myself)

GOD DAMMIT.

When  I was younger, I had the opportunity to audition for a part in  Netflixâ€™s â€œMindhunterâ€, which was being filmed near my location. I  declined. Little did I know my future crush was given a part in the  show. FUCK YOU PAST OLIVER! I couldâ€™ve had an autograph of his! We  couldâ€™ve been friends! We couldâ€™ve had a friendship like Tony Stark and  Peter Parker! I couldâ€™ve had a little more money if I wouldâ€™ve  auditioned (like 6 other people auditioned) and got the part!!! You  fucking idiot!!! You couldâ€™ve had a career in acting but instead you  chose computers, an industry thatâ€™s already over saturated!!!!!!! YOU  COULDVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH KING GEORGE FOR CHRISTS SAKE!!!
