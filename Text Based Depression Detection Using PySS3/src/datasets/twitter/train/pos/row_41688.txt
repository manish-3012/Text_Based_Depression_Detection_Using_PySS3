So today went well.. After school today, I was meeting up with my friends, most of whom go to another school. There was a skatepark where we were meeting, so I decided to bring my skateboard along. When I got there, the skatepark was fine and not too busy. I see some other friends from school at the skatepark and have a chat with them. Then, my crush arrived with her friends. I think it took them by surprise that I was skateboarding because of the way I act at school (loud with my friends, but shy with other people). So, my crush and her friends came over and asked if they could take turns on my skateboard. Of course I said yes, so I sat down next to my friend whilst the had a go on my skateboard. Afterwards, we had a talk and I think it it went well. Since its now the weekend and I won't see her until Monday, is there anything I can do to, like, get closer? I was personally thinking teaching her a bit of skateboarding or something like that. If anyone has any other ideas, they will all be appreciated!
