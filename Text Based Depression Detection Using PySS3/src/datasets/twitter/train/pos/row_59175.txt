weird coincidence ok so one day while i was on youtube i found this cool youtube channel and subscribed, the next day i somehow find their reddit account through a subreddit even though their u/ is a little different from their youtube name

now i keep on seeing their username everywhere on reddit

like if i go click on someones profile they're just right there

how does this happen
