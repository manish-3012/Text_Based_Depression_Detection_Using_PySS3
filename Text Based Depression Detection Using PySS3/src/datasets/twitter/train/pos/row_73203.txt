How i control my farts............. Ok so basically if you want to fart loudly, you have to just let it go as fast as you can as soon as it comes. But if you want to fart silently then when it comes, just gently push it back a lil, then super super carefully bring it out. This is super useful in large groups when you dont want to be caught farting and blame it on someone else. This is also the first useful skill school taught me after years.
