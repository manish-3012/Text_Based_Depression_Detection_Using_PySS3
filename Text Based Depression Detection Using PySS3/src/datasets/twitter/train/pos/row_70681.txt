I bought Fall Guys again ðŸ˜­ basically I have 2 steam accounts and I was "family sharing" from my other account to this one, and I had most of my progress in the account it's shared with. But they just disabled sharing on the game so I'd rather keep my progress. $20 is nothing it is just kinda dumb. Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
