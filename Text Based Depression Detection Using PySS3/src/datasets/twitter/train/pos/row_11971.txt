I have a challange for you all... Type one word of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" but every word is a different language. You can use a translator if you want so it doesn't have to be a language you know. Your reply to the starting comment should look like this:

Never (English) 

Reply:

Marcha (Spanish)

Let's see if we can do it! I also understand that some stuff may get translated weridly but just get the closest word
