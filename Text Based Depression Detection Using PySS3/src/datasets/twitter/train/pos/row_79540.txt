A lot of teens are left or socialistic So where i live like 8/10 teens is left and the rest is right. I mean nothing wrong with it but do they even know how taxes, net worth, racism and more work.

I see eat the rich posts a lot, here if ur worth more than a million people already want ur money. Lets just say u can be worth more than a million but u cant spend that much. For example taxes, networth tax is calculated for the â€œdividentâ€ of ur networth u get each year. My parents told me that they never reach that amount and that its just too high. Ur net worth doesnt grow with 10k a year if u do nothing.

And a lot say to tax people more, have they heard of offshore accounts and rich people just simply moving away?. 

We cant end hunger we cant end homelessness. If everyone would be rich nobody would be rich. Capitalism isnt the best but socialism is way from good. 

Just go get the bread in life and quit crying about rich people so u maybe become one
