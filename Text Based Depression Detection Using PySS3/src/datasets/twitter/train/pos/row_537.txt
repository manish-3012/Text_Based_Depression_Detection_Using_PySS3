snapchat sucks this isnâ€™t really a Reddit moment. the only snaps I get from snapchat are streaks. is that actually the only thing people on snap do now? like I snap them some interesting stuff and they just have to send me back a big fat S?? are their expectations as high as the stratosphere or something? you literally accomplish nothing with a triple digit snap streak...

anyone else using snap in the same boat as me?
