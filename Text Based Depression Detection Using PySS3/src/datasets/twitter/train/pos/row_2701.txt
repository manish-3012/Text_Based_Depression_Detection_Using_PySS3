My girlfriend broke up with me Yes. On Christmas. She said she wanted a little time to herself a few days ago. I knew how this would end. At this point not only am I furious but Iâ€™m just sad and disappointed in her. She was really an amazing girlfriend. I was happier than I had ever been. Iâ€™d been really upset recently due to a multitude of things but then she came into my life and it seemed like everything was good when I was with her. And now she told me she needed space out of nowhere. And now sheâ€™s gone. On Christmas. This isnâ€™t like her. Part of me still thinks sheâ€™ll wake up tomorrow and beg me to come back. A large part of me is praying for it. It hasnâ€™t really hit me yet. That were done. I just canâ€™t accept that. Itâ€™s selfish yes but hey I think I deserve that excuse right now.
