okay can we all agree that some music is objectively bad, i've seen so many posts about how there's no such thing as "bad music" and that's just not true like, there are some artists that i don't personally like but i can recognize that they make good music, but some music is just poorly made. That's like saying there's no such thing as a bad movie because "it's all up to interpretation" and "everyone has different opinions". no, that's not how it works lmao. that's not to say you should shame people for listening to certain music, but some music is just bad
