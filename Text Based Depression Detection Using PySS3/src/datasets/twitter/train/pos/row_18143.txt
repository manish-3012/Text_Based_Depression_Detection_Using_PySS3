How Do I Sneak Out? Ok so my mom doesnâ€™t let me go out with friends she doesnâ€™t know their parents or whatever. in my opinion, itâ€™s a lil dumb. anyways, iâ€™m trying to go meet up with this guy and iâ€™d have to sneak out. my choices are either go to my best friends house and sneak out there but thatâ€™s not a totally safe bet. my mom doesnâ€™t go to sleep till probably four in the morning and my dad goes to work at one in the morning. she doesnâ€™t come in my room past probably two but idk. idk if sheâ€™d believe that iâ€™m trying to go hang out with a friend from school sheâ€™s never met nor heard of.
