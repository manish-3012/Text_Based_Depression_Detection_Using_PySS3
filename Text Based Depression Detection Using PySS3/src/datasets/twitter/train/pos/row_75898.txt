I took a stress test Today my health class started a new unit which was stress and everyone took a little test. The questions were for the last 12 months and various events were given different point values based on how serious they were. The more serious the event the the higher the point value. The highest you could get was 300 and up which was classified as a major life crisis. I got about 550.
