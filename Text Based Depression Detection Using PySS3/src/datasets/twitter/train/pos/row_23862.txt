since i can finally post, i need to rant for a bit about my friends and d r u g s i have this new friend at school, he's a super adorable trans boy calked alex and i hecking love him so much

basically, i asked him to hang out with me. his mum said no, and later that night, threatened to take him out of the school because of me wanting him to come out with me

hes a very over protected child, too. he doesn't smoke, drink, or do drugs, unlike most people at my school (its a very small school for autistic people, stoners, and dropouts)

so today, me and my other stoner friends invited him out with us, and we were gonna leave at lunch time. we begged his mum to go, and she still said no

now, another thing is, one of the methheads at my school, who is the ex bf of one of my best friends, is harassing everyone in the school, especially kids who know nothing about his drama thats going on rn

he harassed my baby alex this morning, and i was worried he was gonna do it again, so i wanted to take alex, especially because if we all left, he'd have NO protection from psycho bitchface

but me and my stoner friends left and said we'd come back to speak to alexs mum in person to see if he could come out. but a few hours later, alex called us, screaming and crying

apparently his mum said she'd take him out of the school, said that alex was a bad child (he really fucking isnt, and shes super lucky she had him as a child instead of ME or ANYONE ELSE IN MY ENTIRE SCHOOL), and misgendered my poor boy constantly

so now, i honestly wanna bash the shit outta his saggy tit 70yo looking plastic mother. ive been crying for most of the night since i got home, thinking about how hes probably gonna get hurt by his mum and how he might get taken out

after that, we haven't heard from him, and im worried asf about it

another thing, unrelated to alex: after we left school, we tried to accumulate $30 to get a bag of weed. it was pretty easy, and me and 3 others left to go to our beloved SeshBushâ„¢

one of them walks up to their dealers house, which lives around there. she gets the weed, and comes back. she starts going off about how its underweighed, and that the bag was only worth $15 when we paid for $30

so basically, we got fucking ripped off and the weed was gone in an hour because of how little there was, and now im pissed off
