Grandma's are fake So hear me out on this one fellows grandma's are just way too nice it gets a little suspicious sometimes huh well guess what they're a government spying tool to see if everyone is keeping 6 ft apart and utilizing their masks if granny sees your not doing 1 of those they will let them now whit that microchip in their forearms and they won't give you as much free money

Pls keep your mask on and keep your distance
