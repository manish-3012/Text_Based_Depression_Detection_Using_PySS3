If you have a bad case of acne remember to swap your pillowcase often. Recently i went to a Dis-chem because my sister was getting a bad case of acne so she went to get a face wash. One of the saleswomen there gave us this great piece of advice and she said "there's no use buying all these great products if you don't change your pillowcase because the same germs from your face stay there when you sleep and will get you back when you sleep the next day". Also if you can stop drinking juices and fizzy drinks and stick to drinking water for atleast a month, it helped me a ton.
