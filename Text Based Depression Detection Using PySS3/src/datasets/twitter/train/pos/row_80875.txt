i miss and also not miss having a life i miss public school but going is not realistic. i am too mentally ill and it is a struggle to get up. it is out of the question. but i do miss it. i miss having friend groups and people asking me sometimes even begging me to hang out with them. i felt so desired. i would clown around with my friends especially in my bio class lol it was the best. and blare my music and vibe. i miss the drama and talking dumb shit about people i disliked. i even went to school drunk once for fun and another time i brought a whole ass gallon of chocolate milk and people found it humorous. i used to get stopped and hugged in the hallway by my friends and we would stop and talk. this one boy liked me so much (his best friend did too, awkward) that he joined a club for me. he was a cute as fuckkk brunette with pretty eyes and nice ass teeth. Lol. i miss stuff like this idk. i dont miss the people i just miss doing stuff. 

i might be going to a halloween party with some acquaintances soon but idk. dumb idea.
