i dont know if my ex classmate is okay shes really worrying me. her status a couple days ago was something like "(unknown person's name) im sorry i disappointing you and your friends and my friends" so i texted her asking how she was. she said she was good. i never asked her about her status but now im worried about her new status. it says "can we call (name) please" so i texted her asking if she was okay an that i saw it. she hasnt texted me back and im just wondering if i should be worried. she was really quiet when i went to her school and nervous. i didnt know her very well, but i know she didnt have any friends. should i be worried?
