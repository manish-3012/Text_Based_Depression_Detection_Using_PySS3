You ever just be chilled out and then- you think it would be a good idea to listen to music and it just brings the mood right back down.. Like holy shit me you just can't let me feel not bad for 3 seconds, I was trying to stay calm for a bit and just watch videos but me knowing my mood just fucking drops much further with music and that I can't bring myself to turn it off puts the most depressing possible music on fuck yeahhhh
