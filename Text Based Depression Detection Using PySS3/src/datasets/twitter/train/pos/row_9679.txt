I woke up bf there was a weird noise outside Idk what it was but it was a constant sound almost like an alarm but Iâ€™m not sure what it was. The only thing I can think of was that it was my neighbors chickens but shiiiit that did not sound like a chicken. Oh well Iâ€™m about to fall back to sleep though
