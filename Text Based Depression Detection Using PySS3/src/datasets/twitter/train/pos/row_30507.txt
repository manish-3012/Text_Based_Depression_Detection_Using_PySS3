If anyone knows how to make a hickey fade it would be greatly appreciated Ok im not bragging about having a social life because i dont technically have a hickey, its just similar

So i have this little silicon finger right? And i was bored while i was studying so i pinched the middle and stuck it to my face so it suctioned. I thought it was kinda funny and when i took it off the mark was initially light but it got darker so now i have dark ass polka dots on my face. And the skin on ur face is super sensitive so getting a â€œhickeyâ€ is super easy.
