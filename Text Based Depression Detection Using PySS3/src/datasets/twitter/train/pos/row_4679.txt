Haha I'm gonna be evil to myself So I set my clock 5 hours later than what the actual time is so I think it's midday even though it's early in the morning. So then my brain goes "Oh shit oh fuck" and I'll instantly be awake.

Edit: I just realized my alarm was off from when I'm supposed to be up. Fuck time
