cheesy letter for a girl i had a pretty good idea why you wanted to talk to me that day.   


we sat in a park, six feet apart and talked about random shit for fifteen minutes.  


"i really like you." you said. "and i really want to date you, but we can't yet."  


"that's ok." i replied. "i just like being with you." it honestly didn't really matter to me, that we couldn't be together because of the virus.   


we talked about how frustrating the quarantine was, and how much we missed normal life. after an hour, we said goodbye and walked home in separate directions. i don't know how to describe what i was feeling. but it was amazing.  


every morning we dmed each other a simple "Gm" and then we would send each other pictures of ourselves using weird filters we found or maybe just our faces. i finally had something real to look forward to. i imagined watching a shitty movie with you in my arms, laughing even when there wasn't anything remotely funny. i put a lot of thought into what i was going to get you for your birthday, even though it wasn't for a good three months.   


we hung out again a week later. you skated over to my house. we walked around, and you told me about your really personal problems. i listened, and that was all you wanted. we tried to learn how to do a pop shove-it, but it was a lot harder than it looked in the video. oh well.  


three days later, you sent me a long text, and i knew it was over before i even started to read it. you talked about how we were too similar, and that a romantic relationship between us would never work, and it was something i could never change.   


i didn't realize how much joy you gave me until it all disappeared instantly. i will never know the feeling of holding you in my arms. i can see how fast you've already moved on when i look at your instagram. i know you won't have a problem finding someone new. and i know you won't miss me at all in a few weeks. and it kills me.
