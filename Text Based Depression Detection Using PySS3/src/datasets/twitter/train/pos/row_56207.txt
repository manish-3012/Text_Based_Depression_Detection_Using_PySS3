I feel depressed because I'm scared my life will be boring I'm only 14, and I've heard people say to me that I should be having the time of my life at this age but I'm not. I'm suddenly extremely afraid and almost depressed thinking I don't make a difference, and that whatever I do, I'm still going to die and my whole life will just be gone. I have so much stress on me aswell and I feel like it isn't even worth it to live this long just to die anyways. I almost can't seem to think straight, like I try to see what's good in life, some things come up but it's like there's fog in front of them so they don't really mean much. I don't know if I want to die, I don't know if I am happy or sad. I have also experienced some weird coincidences making my stupid anxious brain think that I'm in a simulation or some shit like that.
