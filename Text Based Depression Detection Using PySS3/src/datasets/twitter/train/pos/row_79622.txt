You guys wanna know a secret? I'm a male teenager with hair so long you could choke on it. If you've seen my posts you're probably like "no, no you do not" but I live in Florida and it's a little hot so my hair is constantly in a beanie. But I have extremely long hair. And I don't mean like regular long hair for a guy I mean hippie hair. Like when I go into the shower it freaks me out because I think there's a spider on my back but It's just my hair. I have hair so long you could make them into normal sized cornrow braids for girls.
