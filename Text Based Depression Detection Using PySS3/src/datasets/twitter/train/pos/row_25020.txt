Anyone else think that this reddit shouldnâ€™t do T-shirt merch and instead do phone cases and mugs or something. Cause I would buy a mug or phonecase.(it would be more useful and wonâ€™t get me beat up) I would use the phone case at home only though. Itâ€™s probaly just me. But if they do T-shirt merch donâ€™t just make it as simple as one word.
