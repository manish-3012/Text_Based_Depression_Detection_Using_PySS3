The Chronicles of Timâ€™s Beans So I wrote this in an English class group project with a girl I have a crush on (if you were in that group with me then know one of the 3 girls in the group I have a crush on).  We needed to use some vocab words in a paragraph, initially we wrote an incohesive paragraph with the last sentence saying weâ€™d converge them into a coherent storyline but we ran out of budget, (my idea as well) Mrs. D wasnâ€™t good with that so we adapted it into this bean themed story (which I came up with the initial theme of but everyone else really did a good job of bringing it together)


Timâ€™s bean company is looking for a new Vice President of the board.  Most companies hiring would rather not be affiliated with a high school student that has bad grades.  Sarah wanted to expunge all her bad grades so that she would be hired for the job.  Passing Mr. Zâ€™s (originally was name of our actual physics teacher, I switched it to just last initial here) physics would be a huge attainment for her job application.  However, Timothyâ€™s finite amount of Baked Beans is running low, which might prevent him from hiring anyone. Sarah wanted to ascertain the whereabouts of her resume but it had disappeared.  Sarah holds that one poem she can never remember the name of in high esteem; itâ€™s about Timâ€™s baked beans, she hopes.  Although Sarah is a very cogent writer, she couldnâ€™t convince the company to hire her as she write about corn rather than beans.  We had to disperse the acceptance letters before Timâ€™s  ran company ran out of bean workers.  The CEO of other bean company A said he would, â€œbequeath all my beans to Timothy so his company doesnâ€™t go under.  We would converge all out bean factories together, but we ran out of budget.â€

I hope you enjoyed this!
