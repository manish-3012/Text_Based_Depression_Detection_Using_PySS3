Sixth Formers Are Shit Iâ€™ve just started sixth form this year. Itâ€™s fun in an academic way. The freedom in research and the study periods to explore further stuff. But the social side is bad. Iâ€™ve been at an all boys school since yr 7 and now itâ€™s mixed for sixth form. When I started secondary, everyone already knew each other. So all throughout school, Iâ€™ve had 2 friends that I can rely on, everyone else mocks me. Same thing has happened this year. Canâ€™t make any new friends because they all already know each other. Iâ€™ve been rejected by girls when I havenâ€™t even asked, and still disliked by everyone else. I donâ€™t have anything against anyone, and yet they all seem to be against me. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to get closer to some of them and today I got added to a group chat of theirs. Turns out the purpose of the group chat was to attack me and finally tell me to kill myself. 

I donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m doing wrong or why no one likes me. And now, from today, Iâ€™m really hurt. Iâ€™m kinda used to it by now. But Iâ€™ve let my defences down when I got added to that group chat and I donâ€™t know what to do now. Iâ€™m just feeling lonely and sick of life. Just needed to vent
