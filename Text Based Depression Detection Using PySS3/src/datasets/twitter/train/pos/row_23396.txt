guys big story coming up so i was in my online lesson feeling all stressed and feeling sorry for myself, so i foolishly decided to drink away that sorrow, started off slowly, small glasses of kentucky bourbon, then bigger glasses, then started filling the glasses more and more, i just kept it going really 

next thing i know my weary eyes slowly opened despite feeling glued shut, my mouth was dry, lips even drier, face numb, I didnâ€™t have the energy to move or speak but i could see the nurses running around and my mother sat there looking at me, i was so ashamed, my sister found me in my room, puke on the floor and me in my bed having a seizure, not that i remember any of it, obviously my blood alcohol level was off the charts and i couldnâ€™t believe id let this happen, my parents, my best friends, my sister, the doctors and nurses were so supportive and i couldnâ€™t appreciate them more, im gonna get therapy for my emotions, and get a diagnosis cos i think i might be depressed 

anyways once the 7 hours i spent in hospital had gone and i was back home i figured id just shuffle my soothing playlist and sleep, after explaining everything to the friends that were there to help, first song on was â€œwasted timeâ€ by eagles, and it reduced me to tears, but calmed me down all the same but next up was â€œswimming poolsâ€ by kendrick lamar and holyyy shit that hit differently, i couldnâ€™t believe id let that happen so please 

please 

for your sake, and your family, donâ€™t be irresponsible with alcohol
