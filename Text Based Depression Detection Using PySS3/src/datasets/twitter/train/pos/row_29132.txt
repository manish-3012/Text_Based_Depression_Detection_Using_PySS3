Got any confession tips? Backstory: so me and this girl has been talking for 2 years now. We know each other irl and her family loves me, so my success rate is 80% rn. But im too much of a nervous wreck to confess. And the thing is, we go to different schools, (we meet in scouting, her brother does scouts) so im worried some other guy will get her before I do. So i have to do this quick. Also she likes me too but she is making me make the first move. So help a brother out will ya?
