I have seen a lot of very depressed people on here and I want to make sure you are all okay. âš ï¸ tw self harm âš ï¸ 

First of all, if you feel the need to self harm, talk someone first, my pms are always open and there are many people on reddit open to be talked to.

 Second of all, I just want to say that I do not want this to be a tutorial on how to cut. Just because you can do it safely doesnâ€™t mean that you should.  You should always find a different route and may this only be your very last resort.

 Apply downward pressure on it with a towel until the bleeding slows. Then wash it under running water until clean. You can use a mild soap. Then wipe it down with a saline solution, add your dressing (an antibiotic ointment) and then wrap it up with gauze and bandages.  DONT USE RUBBING ALCOHOL (or iodine/ hydrogen peroxide) it will kill healthy cells and make healing slower. Redress the wound every now and then and change the bandage and gauze. If the wound is larger or gaping, close it up with some wound closure strips or cut up medical tape.

(If the wound is large or deep, it would be best to see a doctor instead of home care)

As it heals, monitor it for an infection, if it starts getting very red and warm or any other signs, then go to the ER immediately. Infections can travel through the bloodstream and are very dangerous on larger wounds so do not disregard this. Especially monitor it if the knife was not disinfected.

My pms are always open ðŸ¥º

Making saline solution
â€¢ Get a clean storage container and mixing utensil. Either wash them in the dishwasher or boil them for 5 minutes.
â€¢ Use 1 quart (4 cups) of distilled water, or boil 1 quart of tap water for 5 minutes. Do not use well water or sea water.
â€¢ Add 2 teaspoons of table salt.
â€¢ Mix the water and salt well until the salt is
completely dissolved.
â€¢ Cool to room temperature before using.
â€¢ Saline solution can be stored at room temperature in a tightly covered glass or plastic bottle. You can keep it for up to one week. Always label it and include the date.
