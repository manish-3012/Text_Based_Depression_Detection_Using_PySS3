I miss you Landon. I know you are having the time of your life and I can only be happy for you. Just wished we could be playing the new Cold war Zombies map together right now, even though most the time we would spend reviving Sanchez I would still be having a great time. You know how things went down with my ex and how much that killed me on the inside. Honestly losing our friendship hurt more. I always thought we would be building games together and playing them. I know since you moved you cant see Madison in person so I will still keep up my end of the promise I made (you know what I mean kek) I know when you said you could give less fucks if I was in your life anymore means you really don't care about me but I just want you to know I will always be here for you if you have no one else. You know where to find me.
