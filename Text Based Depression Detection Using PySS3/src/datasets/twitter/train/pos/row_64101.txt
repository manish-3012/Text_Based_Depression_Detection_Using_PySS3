i feel like my online friends dont care anymore im starting to feel that they don't want me as a friend anymore but everytime i try to cut myself off they text hop on and i do. i feel like im in this infinite loop of bs. some examples on what they do is
1. whenever i say something one of them say "not funny"
2. always make fun of my appearance
3. (I dont take games seriously) they always call me trash
4. they dont care what i do and i feel like they don't even care about my health
5. nothing i do is good enough for them 

And i cant even talk to at least one of them because once one gets off they all do and im just tired of it and i can't escape it. idk if im just overthinking it and that's how they act or they genuinely hate me.
