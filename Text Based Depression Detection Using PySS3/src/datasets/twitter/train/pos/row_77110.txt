Heres some insight War is a sick thing and what comes out of it is body counts and veterans who are extremely unwell. And I it seems the countries who wage this war just because they cannot find a better way for the situation, just see a guy with a gun who will take orders without question. 

Bottom line is your enemy is the same person as you are, and you both seem to be fighting in this horrific thing just because you were told too, and these gruesome things are just everywhere all around you.

What comes out of it is just either death or an actual affliction that could lead to even darker pits, like alcoholism or even suicide and from where im standing, the government doesnt really give a shit who they send to the killing fields so long as they win, or what happens to them in war or after it.
