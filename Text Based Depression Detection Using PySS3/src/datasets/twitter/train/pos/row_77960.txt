Whatâ€™s the best way to quit procrastinating? Iâ€™m really a bad procrastinator and I have procrastinated on my AP hw over summer and now itâ€™s due in 2 days. I will still get it done, but not u til theist moment. I just canâ€™t find the motivation to work on stuff like this until I have to. If there are any tips please share them.
