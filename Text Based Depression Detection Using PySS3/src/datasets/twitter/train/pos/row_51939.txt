My dad rickrolls me everyday. So my dads ringtone is Rick Astleys never gonna give you up. Or more known as **The Rickroll.** He gets called everyday by some friends, family and work partners. His phone is on full volume too. My dad doesnt really know what a rickroll is. I explained it to him and he laughed. And that was it. I get rickrolled everyday. But i like the song its better than most music nowadays :)
