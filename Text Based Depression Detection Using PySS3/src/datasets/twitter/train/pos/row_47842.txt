I have taken the L So pretty a much about a year ago a girl had a crush on me and I liked her too (but never said) and I helped her get off her depression meds and after that I was going to ask her on a date. But her friends told her I was leading her on so we didn't speak. We are now talking again but she has said she doesn't like me anymore but I still like her. Sad times. Also I'm not looking for attention I just find it a relief sorta to get this off my chest. Also also, I blame myself for this mess I should have just been honest.
