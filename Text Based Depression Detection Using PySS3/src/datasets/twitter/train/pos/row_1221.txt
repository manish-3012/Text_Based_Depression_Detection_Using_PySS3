I got lead on and don't know how to feel So about a week ago I started to talking with an old friend. I invited her to my friends discord server and we started talking a bit. I developed a crush, and one night decide to ask if she wanted to go out. To my surprise she says yes, so we decide to start dating. We were going to meet up in a couple of days for our first date. But, two days before the date I get a text from her saying that she's not ready to be in a relationship and that we should go back to being friends. 

Im not really sure how to feel right now because I don't really know what happened. Did I fuck up, did she fuck up, did I just get unlucky. All I know is that Iâ€™m not very experienced with dating, and so this seems odd.  Iâ€™m really upset, so I turned here to to vent my issues and attempt to understand.
