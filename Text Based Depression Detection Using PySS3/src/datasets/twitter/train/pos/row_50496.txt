Snapchat - Somebody â€œopenedâ€ a message but I didnâ€™t send anything - glitch? Iâ€™m posting on this sub, because I might actually get a reply, 

3 weeks ago it was my birthday, a friend said happy birthday to me, I said thanks, they said no problem, and that was the end. 

I was just scrolling down, and it says â€œopenedâ€ implying I sent the last message, which I didnâ€™t. 

Is this a glitch?
