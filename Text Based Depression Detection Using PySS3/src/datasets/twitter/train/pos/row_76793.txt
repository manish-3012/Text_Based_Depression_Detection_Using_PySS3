so something really stupid happened to me today i was in ace hardware (cuz why not, i needed something for my skateboard) and after one of the employees helped me look for the part for my skateboard, which they didnâ€™t have, we went down the isle with all of the wrenches, my friends mom called him and i looked at my phone to see if i had any notifications. i then saw i did not, put my phone in my pocket and thought nothing of it.


no less than a minute i did that, the same  employee that helped with the part for my skateboard walked up to us and asked, â€œdo you need anything today?â€ 


we looked at him confused and said â€œnoâ€


he then looked at me and asked â€œso can you please give me the item you put in your pocket?â€ 


we both looked incrediblely confused and said â€œwhat item?â€


and he said â€œwe have you on cameras putting something in your pockets, please take it out and give it to meâ€


i then said â€œi have nothing in my pockets, you can search me or i could take out everything in my pockets.â€ so i took everything out of my pockets TWICE and proved there was nothing. he then left us alone, mind you, without saying sorry. 


so you may be wondering why iâ€™m writing about this. iâ€™ll tell you. i donâ€™t think it was a misunderstanding. look at it this way, iâ€™m a 15, almost 16 year old boy with a hat, baggy clothes and a skateboard. i think itâ€™s they thought i had actually stolen something earlier because they had to have seen my looking at my phone before i put it in my pocket, right? 


and if not, they could have re wound the tapes to see if i was. so i think itâ€™s that or some karen told the employees we looked sus and them seeing my put my phone in my pocket made them believe. 


this is nothing special, iâ€™ve been accused of shoplifting in the past when i did nothing. i just thought this was weird because i feel like they were profiling us or somethin. itâ€™s probably nothing to worry about:
