(weeb shit) might need therapy just finished bunny girl senpai, weathering with you, banana fish and hotarubi no mori e (yes the one with the mask who disappeared when this little bitch touched him) today.

banana fish mostly fucked me up 2day.bli swear to myself I'll kill tha-- the pain is real. i just finished anohana for the 100th time the other day and will watch violet evergarden and rewatch grave of the fireflies again. am planning to watch erased and finally finish Clannad tomorrow.

ahh im so in love with the pain. &lt;3
