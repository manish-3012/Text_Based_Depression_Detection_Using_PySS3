I hate how adults take the time factor of studying as the only Factor! If you didn't understand I mean that parents/guardians think that studying for long time means you have really studied although time is a factor but fffffffffs if someone concentrates to study 15 pages he/she will finish in like 7.5 minutes that is if they are concentrated but i am fed up i actually study for 45minutes in the day and my mom goes to bring bread every morning and goes out ofr an hour so when she comes back she sees me not studying and calls me ( a word similiar to lazy for studying like lazy and dumb wait i am  mad).
But my two sisters just out there books on the table then do what they want in 1 hour and when mom knocks the door they study and stay like for 15 minustes so they look like they are hard working and me i look lazy and unstudyful.

I hope one day she will trust how I study and i am not dumb I am pretty smart so i dont this ridiculous amount of studying oh and this for the morning then i have to study in afternoon and some time at 6pm to 8pm i was studying at 7pm at the time i was righting this 

This post will delete itself in 24 hours cuz you know anyways bye before they catch me
