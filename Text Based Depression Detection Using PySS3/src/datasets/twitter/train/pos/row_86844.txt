Looking for the positives. About 2 months ago I went through a really bad breakup. We were together for about 2 years and he really knew everything about me and my life....well our life lol. He moved on really quickly. Lead me on when relationships with other people didnâ€™t work just to have attention from someone. A few weeks ago he lead me to a hard spot in the road. He said make me love you again. Me, being oblivious to toxicness, openly said yes. I messaged him so many times. Trying to make him find those feelings again. The next day he says that he found someone else, really? That quickly? I messaged him about a week later he said that I really need to leave him alone. So that is what I have been doing. Leaving him alone...Leaving myself even more alone. Heâ€™s living the dream. I donâ€™t know how to move on because opening up to someone like that again scares me. It genuinely scares me and I feel like Iâ€™m going to just live my life without love, or someone to love. God apparently has other plans and I really hope he leads me to that person because I need help finding them. 

Since then Iâ€™ve started to diet. Losing some weight, I honestly donâ€™t need to lose any but it makes me feel better. I canâ€™t really walk or run right now because I had surgery but since the New Years has begun I have started to do a bunch of exercises. Started getting ABS! Doing my hair and makeup. Getting dressed in the morning. I have gotten so much taken from me these past few months and itâ€™s honestly seriously a struggle. I, however, am grateful to have gone through these. It hurts, a lot, but I have become a better, stronger person because of these challenges. Screw my ex because he is missing out on this. New and improved. Breakups are not the end of the world even if you think they are. I think it is but the thing about hitting rock bottom is thereâ€™s only one way to go.....up!
