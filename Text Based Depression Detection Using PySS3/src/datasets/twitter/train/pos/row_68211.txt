Generation Alpha's nickname So some generations have nicknames, like Gen Y, which is the Millienials, and the Baby Boomers and Silent Generation.

For those who don't know, Generation Alpha is the generation that comes after us, Gen Z.  So here's the thing:  If we can shorten Generation Z to Gen Z, that means we can shorten Generation Alpha to Gen Alpha.  Alpha can also be shortened to just the letter A, so now we have Gen A.

Say "Gen A" out loud and tell me why we shouldn't call them the Gump Generation.
