I confessed my feelings to my best friend who I fell in love with, it didn't go well Now I'm scared. She didn't exactly reply with what she was feeling, now I'm left afraid I've messed up, and I've lost her. I really regret it, it's not like anything can happen. She told me that I wasn't open with my feelings, but I think my feelings were too much. She definitely doesn't feel the same, she had loads of opportunities to tell me. I don't know where to go from here, our situation is complicated (if you want check my post history). Its the first time I've felt this way about someone, so I'm really clueless. Part of me wishes I never fell for her.
