I don't know why my sixth period teacher is a teacher She's not a bad teacher as far as teaching the curriculum but she's a shit human being. she uses popsicle sticks with our names on them to pick somebody to answer the question. she called 1 person and they didn't answer, she called a second person and they said they didn't know, then she picks me and I ask where the document we are working on is because I was looking for the online version since she didn't give me a physical one and she gets mad at the class for not paying attention. she also made me stay an hour after class because I didn't do today's assignment in class (doing it outside of class is better for me) and gives me this whole speech about respect and how I should have a conversation with her if I want to do it outside of class and she asked "if you don't have respect for me why do you even bother showing up to class". I tell her I only come to get the homework since my parents would be pissed if I failed a class.

thank you for coming tp my ted talk
