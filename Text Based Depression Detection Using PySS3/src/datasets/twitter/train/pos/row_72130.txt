Can you rumble your ears? If you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about, you probably canâ€™t. But for example, when you shut your eyes really tight (some people donâ€™t have to do that, it varies) do you hear a low rumbling sound in your ears? Youâ€™re moving a muscle in your ear that only some people can voluntarily move. 

Iâ€™m curious about the ratio of people that can and canâ€™t do it, since itâ€™s never been very clear.
