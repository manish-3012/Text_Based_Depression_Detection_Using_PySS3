I almost killed my self I had a really really bad day a few days ago and was just really down. I snuck out in the middle of the night to a bridge. I sat on the edge of that bridge, thinking. I nearly jumped. But two police officers showed up and stopped me. I was admitted to a hospital and I was released yesterday. I feel better, but not the best still. Just glad to be home with family and safe.
