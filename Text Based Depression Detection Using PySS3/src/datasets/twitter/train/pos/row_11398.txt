Healthy fighting Conflict- identity the problem 

Communication- IMPORTANT. Talk and listen to each other. Try to understand 

Resolve- If youâ€™re right, be humble, if youâ€™re wrong, take it kindly while saying, â€œwhateverâ€, and things like that. If you canâ€™t resolve, agree to disagree

Forgive- donâ€™t hold a grudge and donâ€™t use this against your partner later
