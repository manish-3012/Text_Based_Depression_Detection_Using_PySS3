I don't know what to do Ok so let me start off by saying, I was in an internet relationship. During the pandemic, I made lots of friends online and she was one of them. I know this wasn't smart but I never got conformation if she was actually a girl, like a vc or picture. She kept refusing or changing the topic whenever I asked her.

At this point I had kinda stopped trying to make new friends and I was mostly playing or chatting with her. Then, I took a break from the game that we both played together. When I came back, she had made a new friend group, but still chatted regularly with me on the game, but not as much outside of it (on discord). I think she felt kinda bad for ignoring me at this point bc she bought me a birthday present.

I felt guilty every time I asked her just for one simple vc. Eventually, I had enough of this and I told her that she would have to vc with me at least once or I was gonna stop talking to her (this was half a year after we met). She refused and I stayed by my word and removed her. I feel kinda bad looking back on it now but I don't feel like I coulda really done anything different.

Is it ok what I did? I feel lonely after this and I feel like it's all my fault.
