My pc won't work. What do I do? Today I attempted to build my first pc. I connected everything and when I turned it on the screen said "reboot and select proper boot divorce." What do I do? I tried for a while and nothing is working. If I tell my parents this they will flip out because they spent a lot of money on the parts. Please I am begging you.
Edit: nevermind I fixed it
