I ducked up I fucked up. I fucked up real hard. Ok, Iâ€™ll get into it.

So, it was Saturday. It was my friend, his parents, my parents. We were having a good time and my step mom made whiskey cupcakes. I, being the very totally adventurous person had one, and liked it. Now, the sugar to whiskey ratio was bad. The cupcake basically tasted like edible whiskey. And then to â€œtraumatizeâ€ me from trying it again they gave me a shot of whiskey. This worked for them as kids, so they thought no harm no foul. And then I liked it. And then I felt a bit off for the rest of night, nothing big just being more charismatic and felt good. And now we are in present day and I want some... I donâ€™t want to do it again because Iâ€™m afraid it will spiral out of control. So yeah! Big oof for me, wish it never happened. Might delete this sooner or later.
