Anyone who says California should fix its pollution problem clearly doesnâ€™t understand how wind works The Midwest needs to fix our problem, cuz what happens is a coal power plant or anything else in Nebraska or anywhere else West of the Mississippi pollutes the air, than that air gets blown by wind into one of Californiaâ€™s many valleys where it gets trapped, thus causing the worst air quality in the country 

Most of our pollution is coming from the midwest, not California. Iâ€™m not saying weâ€™re devoid of blame but weâ€™re the only ones actually trying to do anything about it
