Have you ever felt guilty/sympathy in taking away/saw someone take away a puppy away from its parents? So what happened a few weeks ago, near my house  a few street puppies were born. Sadly all of them died due to a truck  accident but one of them survived. He was very cute so one time we bought him home to play with him (we sent him back in the streets afterwards), his mom saw it tho. We kept him inside for about half an hour and outside for like 8 minutes his mother was crying because she didnâ€™t had her son. We gave him back.
One time his mum was sleeping so we quietly took him home and we decided that we would keep hi. I felt sad about its mother for that reason, but we gave him away because he was a street dog and could bring infections and diseases.
I recently came to know someone took him away, I felt sad especially since I saw his mum crying and felt sympathy and sad on him being separated from his mom. Do you feel the same as me, because at the end of the day if it was supposed to be a human no one would take it.
