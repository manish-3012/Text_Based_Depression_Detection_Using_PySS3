losing time do you ever feel like youâ€™re losing time? like one minute itâ€™s 8 am and the next thing you know itâ€™s 10 pm and youâ€™re back in bed. Iâ€™ve been feeling this for a few days now, i feel like iâ€™m losing myself and iâ€™m losing meaning to each day. itâ€™s just the same thing over and over again. does anyone know what this is called?
