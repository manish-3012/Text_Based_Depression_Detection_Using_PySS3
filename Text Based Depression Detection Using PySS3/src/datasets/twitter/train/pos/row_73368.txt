I'm having a sad period Yesterday was my birthday and it was the only happy day after 3rd October. I'm passing an unhappy period perhaps due to some reasons for my social life and my scholastic life (mostly the social one). In the last year, I started attending High School and, despite I thought I was passing a good period, I didn't pass it well: I didn't be able to socialize with my schoolmates and I became introverted and lightly social phobic. I'm not very integrated with my class. This year my friends started attending High School in the same school as me and some of them started socializing on the first day! I burned with envy and I felt wrong. I'm also so sad (on the First Day I cried after years I didn't cry) because I'm scared that my best friend will forget me due to too much friendship and in this days I suspected she is writing and considering me less than other periods. Despite this, I recently hugged her and this makes me happy and she told me that she loves me (I'd specify we aren't engaged we are only comfortable friends). This is the only thing that makes this situation nicely.
