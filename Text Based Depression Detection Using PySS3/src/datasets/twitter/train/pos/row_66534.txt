I have a pet turtle and she's ADORABLE So I have a pet turtle and her name is Ben (we thought she was a boy first but the vet confirmed she was a girl) and she's so curious it's adorable, she loves to climb stuff even if it's too high or too steep to climb. Recently she tried to climb a wall and got flipped upside down so I had to help her :p
