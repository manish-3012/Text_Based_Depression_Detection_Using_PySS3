Finding someone during COVID/quarantine 
Hello, I consider my self an introvert and have been stuck inside for months.I am a senior in high school and I have been thinking that my high school experience with girls has been pretty much non existent and Its kinda made me sad. I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s just me but finding someone is especially hard right now. The only time I leave the house is either for work or a bike ride. If anyone has tips in getting into a relationship for someone like me that would be cool.       :)
