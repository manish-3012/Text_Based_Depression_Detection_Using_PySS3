I don't think my school is going to stay open much longer. They aren't being careful AT ALL. One of the teachers was exposed to COVID and I haven't heard anything about her test results  (her son that lives with her tested positive.) And a lot more people in my town have been testing positive. To my knowledge no one at the school has tested positive yet.

One girl's parents had it but she came back to school because she was negative, but she still should have quarantined for 2 weeks. 

I highly doubt my school will still be opened by the end of the week.
