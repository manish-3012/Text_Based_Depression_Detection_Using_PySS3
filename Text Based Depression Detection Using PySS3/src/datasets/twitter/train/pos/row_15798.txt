wow iâ€™m a shit friend,i really am iâ€™m just figuring out i left my friend of three years to date a dude she liked for three years just for the dude to completely fuck me up mentally. iâ€™m a shit person and i didnâ€™t realize till now i apologize to her on instagram and iâ€™m gonna see if she wants to go for a walk tomorrow. she doesnâ€™t have to except my apology or go for the walk but i had to say sorry. people never leave your friend for a girl or boy unless itâ€™s for a very very very good reason. those girls and boys who you are dating will probably leave a lot quicker than the friends. those girls and boys will use you and lie to you but the friends will stay by your side. please donâ€™t hurt your friends you need them. i know i sure need mines right now,hug all your friends,tell them you care. i didnâ€™t realize how shit i was till i lost the dude and my friend than it hit me. i broke the girl code for a shitty dude. please donâ€™t be like me they are other shitty dudes or girls,ones that your friends didnâ€™t have a crush on for three years.
