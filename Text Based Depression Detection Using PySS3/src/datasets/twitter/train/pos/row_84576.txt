I think my mom found out about my self harm. With no context she decided to share with me a quote by Freud she found on the internet: "Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways", and just left it at that. If it's really just a random quote she liked, then it's one heck of a coincidence. 

If she really did notice the marks on my arm, I must say props to her, that's a nice way of saying "I'm here to talk if you need me" without getting too personal.

P.S: I know some of you will tell me to talk to her, but please spare me that, it's due to gender dysphoria and I believe she's quite LGBTphobic.
