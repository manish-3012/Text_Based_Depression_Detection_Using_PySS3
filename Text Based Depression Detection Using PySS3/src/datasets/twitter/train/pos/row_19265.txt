Guys help I have a problem and I dont know if this is the right place to post it but I know some people know this subject a lot more then me.
 So we purchased something on a site called 'Naughty night boutiques' and im just scared that it was kind of a fake site. Does anyone know this site ? If its ok, official or anything ? I saw some of their products were also on amazon with their name in the title but im still scared since its been almost 2 months since we ordered and the perso that answered me throught text seemed a bit weird. 
Any way I hope any of you can help me, thanks in advance ?
