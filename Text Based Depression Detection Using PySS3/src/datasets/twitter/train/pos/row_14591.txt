Can Someone Artistic Unlike Myself Diss My Friend For Me? His name is Denis He is Russian/Canadian he plays Minecraft 24/7 and has never had a girlfriend and has at least two concurrent crushes that are almost always never interested in him, and if they are he ruins it. For example, he replied to his crushed snap of her face with a picture of his potato farm on Minecraft saying "on that Minecraft grind" he is also sending people like other friends including me the Mario sonic kissing gif, and it's annoying and unfunny. Also, he games on a Mac instead of a pc so we make fun of him for that. Thank you to anyone who makes a diss for me, if you need any more information on him ask me!
