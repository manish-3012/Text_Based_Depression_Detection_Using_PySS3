Some thoughts Iâ€™ve been having recently. Hello there, my name is u/ZacksPocketChange and I am a sanitizer man. I go around the country buying industrial property that I can convert it to factories to produce hand sanitizer. The factories produce the hand sanitizer and then it is dumped into a large container of the stuff where it gets cleaned if any impurities. I then have the sanitizer pumped through a pipeline to a a bottling plant where it gets bottled, packaged, and shipped out to store.

Now, letâ€™s say that you and I both have our own bottles of hand sanitizer respectively. But, I have an extra long pump and tube that goes across the room and into your bottle where it pumps yours out. Do you get it? I pump your hand soap. I PUMP YOUR HAND SOAP!  I PUMP IT OUT!

DID YOU REALLY THINK THAT YOUR SONG AND DANCE AND SUPERSTITION WOULD HELP YOU?! I AM THE THIRD REVELATION! I AM WHO THE LORD HAS CHOSEN! Iâ€™M SMARTER THAN YOU! Iâ€™M OLDER! AND YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A FALSE PROPHET! YOU SNIVELING CHILD! I AM THE THIRD REVELATION! I AM THE THIRD REVELATION! I TOLD YOU I WOULD EAT YOU! I TOLD YOU I WOULD EAT YOU UP! 

THATS IT THATS IT!
