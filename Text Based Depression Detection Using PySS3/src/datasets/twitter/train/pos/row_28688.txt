Did I ever mention that my little brother pissed on my face before. Obviously not his fault, he was a toddler still in diapers but it just happens to fall off when he's standing on my pillow, above my head, holding onto the bed's headboard. I ran out of my room saying: he pissed on my face! Not a joke. This is the go to funny story every time I meet little kids. 

This brother is the third child, the silly, angry, impulsive and aggressive one. He falls down the stairs all the time. Slowly becoming an ipad kid and addicted to minecraft.
