I hope to keep my virginity until marriage. (Feel Free to Make Fun of Me :D) There's no real reason why I can't loose my virginity before, I just want to be committed to one Woman (Or Man) and that person only. Chances are, I'm not going to loose my virginity as a teen anyway, because I'm ugly as hell, and not attractive whatsoever. So that's my rant on being a virgin.
