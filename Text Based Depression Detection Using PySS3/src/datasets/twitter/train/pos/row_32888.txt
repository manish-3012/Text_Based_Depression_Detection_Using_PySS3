Online schooling is the best I don't have video conferences and we just have a place, where the teachers drop exercises. Today there is only one task, that we have to return next month. Usually 60% or 70% percent of the school day, I can just do my own things. This school is also ridiculously easy. Barely any tests and no homework at all. Now I will shut up.
