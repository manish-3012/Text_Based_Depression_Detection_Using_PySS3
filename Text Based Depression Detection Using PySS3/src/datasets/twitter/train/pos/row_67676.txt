I think Iâ€™m just a crybaby I am 13, female. I am an introvert, and I think I have social anxiety of some sort (not sure tho). I hate hormones. My brother (16) opened my door without asking, and forcefully made me have a heated conversation with him about my paint. He wanted art supplies. He then said â€œu better lose ur attitude. Iâ€™m getting tired of itâ€ like what a parent says to a child. Itâ€™s always me who has to obey him. After he said that, he left. I locked the door. My dad said something that I didnâ€™t respond to. I felt bad about that. And then I started crying. I hate hormones. But why canâ€™t he just not talk to me? Thatâ€™s the best solution. If he doesnâ€™t talk to me, and I donâ€™t talk to him, then we wonâ€™t have any conflicts and bad feelings. He needs to be aware of whatâ€™s happening to me right now. Hormones, I think, cause me to act like this. This is not an excuse. And yesterday me and my friend argued, and it was horrible. I hate arguing. And I still have a lot of schoolwork thatâ€™s due. Everything is stressing me out, so I watched YouTube. YouTube calmed me down, and took me out of this world for a while. And then he interrupted this delicate peace, making it horrible again. He needs to observe, and think, â€œwhy is she acting this way? Maybe something is wrong with ME (him)â€. Or we could just both ignore each other, which I think is the best solution. And I hate it when he acts like heâ€™s better than me, and like Iâ€™m a lesser person. He always talks down to me. And my first reaction is to always cry, and I donâ€™t know why, but it just sucks. Hearing his voice and looking at his face makes me wanna kick him in the balls and scream and cry.
