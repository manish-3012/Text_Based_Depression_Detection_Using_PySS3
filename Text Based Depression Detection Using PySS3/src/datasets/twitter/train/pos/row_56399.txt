I have dyslexia, but I also have autocorrect. Thanks grammarly, autocorrect and other grammar correcting stuff. Thank you teachers thank you brother, thank you everyone for listening to my TedTalk. Actually nvm, but the reason I donâ€™t make spelling mistakes is cuz of this class I had to go to, I had to remember the base of the words, until it was tattooed onto my brain. But comprehending words is just a pain. This is why I usually use audiobooks. Also also, yes the words do flip and dance around.
