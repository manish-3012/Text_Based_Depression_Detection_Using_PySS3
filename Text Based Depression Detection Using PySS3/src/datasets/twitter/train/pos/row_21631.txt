Backhanded compliments are not cool So I was on TikTok and there was this guy doing some sort of challenge. This guy is a black dude but has vitiligo so part of his face is a different colour. All the comments are 

"Your so hot"

 "You could be a model"

"Your cute I'm so jealous"

"I wish I was like you"

No the fuck you don't. Your forcing this "your beautiful" shit because of his skin. That's a backhanded compliment, and that's not cool. Your saying this because of his skin problem, not because you genuinely think he's attractive. Your treating him like a dog. Your treating him like a pet. It's wrong, it's weird and your really just insulting him
