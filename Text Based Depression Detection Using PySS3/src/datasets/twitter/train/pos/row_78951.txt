My grandfather's dog died today due to not having the proper vaccines We hear a lot of times that vaccines are really important and save lives but very rarely we hear the impact that they have on pets lifes too. Please do not commit the same mistake that my grandfather made (although he didn't have much money to do it he didn't accept my help with it) nor the mistake that I made of not insisting enough.

Always cherish the moments you have with your pets because you never know when they are the last.
