I finally got into a relationship Iâ€™m 18 and I finally got my first girlfriend. And damn, does it feel good! Weâ€™ve recently got into  and cuddling and when we do that, I just feel happy. Itâ€™s just so nice and warm to feel another personâ€™s affection towards you ðŸ˜Š. I feel like I would give her the world if I could. Thatâ€™s pretty much all, not looking for any answers, just felt like sharing my happiness to the internet
