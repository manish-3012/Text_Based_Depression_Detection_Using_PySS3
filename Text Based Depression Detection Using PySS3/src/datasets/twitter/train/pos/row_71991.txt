I hate myself a year or so back this girl who's my friend asked me out but I said no like the fucking idiot I am and now I've started to get really strong feelings for her and I asked her out and it was basically she's questioning her sexuality n shit so she said mabye but I'm taking it as a no

we're really good friends but I can't get over her and I don't get why I've started to get feelings for her now why am I such a fucking idiot
