I'm tired I can't even keep myself distracted with the things I loved. I don't enjoy cooking, I don't enjoy sewing, I don't enjoy drawing since it always ends up shit, I can't enjoy music.

I'm tired living with my family I'm done with arguments everyday and being blamed. I feel tired everyday even when I take a nap. I feel worthless . I wish I didn't have to go through an existential crisis everytime. 

I feel useless or worthless everytime I don't do something but if I can't enjoy doing it what's the point in doing it?

I'm tired I just want to be unbothered. I was doing just fine before I was born I was unbothered.
