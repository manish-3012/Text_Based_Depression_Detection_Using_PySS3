Im 17! Can you guys fulfil my birthday wish for me? Id love it if you could do just one of the things below in my list. 


Go hug your friend, dad, mum, grandmother, grandfather, and tell them you love them.

If you have a dream, chase it and donâ€™t stop until you get what you want. 

Take care of yourself by drinking a glass of water or taking a shower.

Tell yourself you matter and remember to love yourself too.

Do something nice for someone, be kind to one another and help turn this shitty planet into a better place.

Go for that run, your health is important.

Study hard and donâ€™t give up no matter how hard it is.

Donâ€™t recklessly spend and remember to save your money. You cant rely on your parents forever

Donâ€™t wait to tell him or her you like them. If you keep waiting for something to happen, nothing will. And that applies to many many things, go for that job interview, ask for help from your teacher. Donâ€™t sit around waiting or youâ€™ll be waiting your whole life you elephant &gt;:(

Theres probably a lot of things ive missed out, but i can just wish for them again next year. Let me know if you did any of them and tell me how it goes! Imma be on my pc for another 10 hours wasting my life away. But you guys bloody shouldnâ€™t.

Have a great kickass day you beautiful motherfuckers
