I am a fish. So if you search "true map of Louisiana, you will find [a](https://www.google.com/search?q=true+map+of+louisiana&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS932US944&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=IqsZ19lRLbLOnM%252CkLKqG0FMVFsuvM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRDL9Yc1Xbp-an4OS5O7DMVr9yewA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjR_brU5OTvAhUtB50JHb4OAogQ9QF6BAgHEAE&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=625#imgrc=IqsZ19lRLbLOnM) map of Louisiana showing lost coastline. Now search up a map of Louisiana, and you can see New Orleans is right under the estuary, Lake Pontchartrain, so the "true map" or Louisiana has made New Orleans along with a bunch of other cities part of The Gulf of Mexico. So therefore everyone living in these places live underwater and are fish.
