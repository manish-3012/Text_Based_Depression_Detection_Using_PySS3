donâ€™t get too connected to ur internet friends fr it never turns out good for me (ik lots of people have great friendships that they made over discord)

example: me and this girl we used to talk so much and we had some things in common like both trying to stop self harming other things so we talked A LOT but as i should have expected it ends terrible for me but she just moves on to someone else

pretty much everyone i considered a great friend said that they got tired of me which hurts and i canâ€™t figure out what i did wrong, i guess i wasnâ€™t online enough.  one guy from switzerland (iâ€™m from england) met on discord and we woke on snap , friends enough for me to be doing his english homework for him. but again one day he starts getting toxic and now heâ€™s blocked me 

tldr: everyone i considered a friend on the internet left me confused and hurt
