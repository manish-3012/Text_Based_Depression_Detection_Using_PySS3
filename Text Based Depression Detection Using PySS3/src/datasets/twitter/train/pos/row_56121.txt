The underlying transphobia and anti-enby attitudes in teenagers online I'll keep it brief. (DON'T AWARD THIS POST - I'M NOT WRITING THIS FOR KARMA. IT NEEDS TO BE SAID)

As a transmale (Also Ace and Panromantic...) who's still pretty young, I (and many other trans/enby people) can't be on this sub anymore. It's much too toxic. 

You're not funny because you called the '"""blue-haired girl""" a fucking printer or some shit.

You're not funny because you called another enby person an attack helicopter (I KNOW that "joke" is old. It's sad that I saw it yesterday)

Please don't use gay as an insult. It's just weird...

It angers me the amount of people who think that anything that isn't either straight, gay, or bi is a mental disorder. You're fucking up a bunch of other teenagers that just want to be in the community. Understand that those kids don't really have anywhere else to go.

Before I knew I was part of the LGBTQ+ Community, I thought those jokes were funny. Now, I realize they're repetitive and detrimental.

Teenagers in the LGBTQ+ want to belong here. I know that this community isn't the worst by far, but it would be better if you understand that some jokes don't need to be said. You can still make jokes with the LGBTQ community, but you shouldn't make them the butt of it. 

Thank you for reading, peace and love
