I need a helping hand Hey guys and girls! like i said i need a helping hand. my bestfriend is truning 18 in may and i need help with a gift, in my counrty truning 18 is a big deal because it means you're an adult. He is a great dude, a good friend and made me fall in love with hiphop, especially 50cent. he is a big fan and has every album on cd except the "power of the dollar'' mixtape. 

could you guys help me find the cd? i tried to find it myself and dont know where to look anymore, maybe you guys know a little bit more than me.

thanks :)!
