Iâ€™m sad and insecure about what to do with my gf So, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m advance if my grammar isnâ€™t the best, as Iâ€™m auto dictated in English. Well, going strait to the point, Iâ€™m currently in a 2 year long relationship, with a girl that I admire for her beauty and kindness and etc etc. Well, Iâ€™m have some problems like depression and anxiety, for over 4 years now (since I was 13), and I donâ€™t know if what Iâ€™m feeling is affected by this problems, because nothing changed in my relationship with her Iâ€™m the last 6 months. Like, I asked her today if I could take some time off to think about my life and us, because after these 2 years, I realized that Iâ€™m never going to experience some â€œone night hookupsâ€ and some other single crazy shit. Iâ€™m confused, because although I think sometimes Iâ€™m not in love with her anymore, just seeing her cry, or thinking about how sad she was, it literally broken me to pieces, so I donâ€™t know if I love her or not, do anyone here had any experience like this? 
Thanks for the attention, and keep safe.
