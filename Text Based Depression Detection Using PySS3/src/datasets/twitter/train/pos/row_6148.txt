What a loss. Canon EOS M200, we were meant to be together, but you were too far away. next summer i promise to come see you. there's a Canon EOS M200 camera in sale in a store but they're all sold out in the stores near me and my mom does not trust post to be able to deliver it safely. This was my only chance to get a good camera for a seriously great price. EOS M200 is all I've ever wanted in a camera but i guess it was never meant to be after all. I have to get a job for summer because i can no longer live in peace knowing a camera of that quality, versatility and price exists out of my hands.


 The sale will be over and forgotten by summer, but Canon EOS M200, I will never forget you.
