Proud of myself for standing up to a maskless idiot So earlier today, I went to the tennis courts with my best friend to get back to playing after having not touched a racket for over two months. As I am walking to reserve a court and to wait for my friend a girl a little older than me (iâ€™m 14) cuts right past me to get a court but all the courts are full. I was a little pissed she was not wearing a mask in a small area of at least 10 people close together. She then mutters to herself something like, â€œShoot the courts are full, might have to try another placeâ€ and leaves, leaving me the next person to grab a court. She walks halfway to the parking lot and meets her dad and they talk for a minute and in that time a court opens up. I go to grab it but they come back and demand I give it to them. Well, her dad is also not wearing a mask and now I really get mad and snapped. I yelled at him saying I have every right to take this court and that he has no right to even talk to me without a mask. I then told him to shut up and get out since I was now really really mad and I know people who have died to COVID. After yelling at me a little he left with his daughter and another coach on a nearby court applauded me. It honestly felt really good to stand up for myself especially to a person like that.
