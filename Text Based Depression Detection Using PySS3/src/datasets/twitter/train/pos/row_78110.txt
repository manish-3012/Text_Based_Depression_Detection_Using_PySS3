Girls really say â€œkill all menâ€ mainly referring to straight white men Until they saw a straight white man kill himself in a video. They donâ€™t understand that no oneâ€™s problems are invalid. The pain that man went through and the fact that he wasnâ€™t even scared broke my heart to pieces. This is how men are different from women, â€œKAMâ€ girls. Men commit suicide 3-4x more than women do. Donâ€™t ever invalidate their pain ever again. Yâ€™all were quick to see that until you got raw evidence of what actually goes on in real life. You guys are horrid.
