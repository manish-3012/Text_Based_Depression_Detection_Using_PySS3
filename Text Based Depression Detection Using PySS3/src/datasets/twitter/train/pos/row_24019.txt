I know no one cares and no one asked however I have lost several kilograms recently and now sit at 97kg

I havenâ€™t given in to my milk addiction in a few weeks and may have even beaten it (I am sorry r/neverbrokeabone)

I have almost completely cut sweets out of my diet

I only take fast food when hanging out

I have learned to eat more moderately

I feel pretty proud of myself not gonna lie, all I need is to exercise a bit more often. Oh and donâ€™t worry I am not starving myself or anything
