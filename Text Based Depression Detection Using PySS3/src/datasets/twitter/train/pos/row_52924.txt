am i really transphobic due to the fact I wouldnâ€™t date a M to F? This is a serious question, please donâ€™t downvote me to oblivion, now I wouldnâ€™t date a person who was born a man but now identifies as a female, even if they had all the female parts, it just does not sit right with me, now I donâ€™t have anything wrong with gay people or trans people to each itâ€™s own but to call me transphobic because I wouldnâ€™t date a trans person seem kind of out of line, so does it actually make me transphobic or is it just trans being upset?
