My Drawing Got Into a Museum *Screaming Intensifies* So for my school, I did an art assignment (obviously lol). Just today my parents got an email that my art had been chosen to be put in an art gallery in a museum; I've had a few field trips to said museum in the past (for both history and art). The gallery lasts about a month long, but still, it's really cool-- I'm not sure how to feel, Im so confused yet excited aaaAAAAAAAA
