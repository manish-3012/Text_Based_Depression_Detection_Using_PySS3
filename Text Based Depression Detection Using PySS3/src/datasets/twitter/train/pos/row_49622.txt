You are not allowed to have a reason to be mad as a teenager This is seriously getting to me, 

ever since I became 14 about a year ago every time I get mad, instead of my parents considering that maybe I have a reason, itâ€™s â€œbEcAuSe iM 15â€

No, just because I am a teenager does not me I cannot be mad for a legitimate reason, nope because Iâ€™m a teenager I can only be mad for the one reason that is that I am a teenager therefor I shall be angry,

And because Iâ€™ve seen how disgusting my brother was (and still is) to everyone for nothing, Iâ€™ve made a promise to myself I will not be that stereotypical teenager, 

And yet after making sure that my reasons for getting mad are legitimate and not throwing tantrums over nothing, the moment I turned 14 I canâ€™t be mad with a reason.
