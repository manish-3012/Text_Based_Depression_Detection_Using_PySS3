EshHesh it's me thiccums from Skirbbl.io On November 11, at about 10:30 - 11:00 pm PST, I was on [Skribbl.io](https://Skribbl.io) playing a match as I usually do, EshHesh and I were competing pretty evenly and I thought "Hey this guy seems pretty cool, I think I'll give them my discord" so after asking them if they had discord I went to go see what the number thing was for my discord was. Right as I got back for some reason my browser refreshed and kicked me from the game before I was able to give them my discord. EshHesh if you are out there hit me up bro.
