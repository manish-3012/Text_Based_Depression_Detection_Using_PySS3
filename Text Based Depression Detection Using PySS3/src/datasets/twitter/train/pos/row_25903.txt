Every book I remember being required to read at school badly summed up in 10 words or less (spoilers) part 1 The Giver - old man teaches kid about feelings

City of Ember - an underground city has problems being underground

Secret Life of Bees - girl runs away and becomes one with the bees

Of Mice and Men - Lenny does not earn the bunny rabbits

1984 - society doubleplusungood

Death of a Salesman - the salesman dies at the end


Please let me know of more books you were forced to read in English, I'll do that for Part 2 if I have read them ;)
