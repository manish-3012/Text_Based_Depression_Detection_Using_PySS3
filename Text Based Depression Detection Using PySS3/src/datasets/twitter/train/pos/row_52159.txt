What do you think of organs from the 3d printer? [Help: please read the first block] [In my country it is customary in high school to write a so-called 'technical paper' or Facharbeit. This claims a scientific approach. This question is my own contribution. I will collect the opinions and present them in statistics. I look forward to every contribution from you.]

I am engaged in the construction of prostheses from the 3d printer. A few years ago the University of Twente (Netherlands) managed to print living cells.
It is only a matter of time before artificial organs can be produced which will later become mass-produced.
