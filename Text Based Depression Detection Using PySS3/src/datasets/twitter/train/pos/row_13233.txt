Fuck racists and sexists This has probably been said before, but racists and sexists have absolutely no place in this world. I will never understand why people are treated differently just because they are a different gender or that the amount of melatonin in their skin is different. It just makes no sense. They are both cliche, old ideals that, for SOME REASON, people still like to stick to.

Sexism, against anyone, is horrible. It doesn't matter who the target is. It's fucking horrible. Telling a girl to go to the kitchen because that's so-called "where she belongs" is so fucking old and there's no reason it should still be a thing. 

However, women are not the only victims of sexism. Many men face the same problem everyday as well. Just because one man does something wrong, it doesn't mean the entire gender is some sort of evil spirit that only exist to catcall women and other bullshit like that. **Some of us may do that, but 99% of us are not like that.** 

Same thing goes with racism. It's dumb, hurtful, and way past its time. Just because someone has a darker skin tone than you it doesn't mean that they should be treated differently. Before telling someone to "go back to their own country" just remember where your ancestors came from. Your ancestors probably weren't from America either. How do you think that makes them feel?

That's all I gotta say. Thank you for reading. Please be kind to each other no matter what. And if you're racist or sexist, then you gotta fix yourself. That's all I'm gonna say.
