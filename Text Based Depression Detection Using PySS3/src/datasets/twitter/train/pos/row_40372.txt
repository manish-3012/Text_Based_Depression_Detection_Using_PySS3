My dad just got mad at me My dad got mad at me for stopping my stepbrother from letting the dog outside. The issue is that the stepbrother doesnâ€™t like the dog and we were eating. My stepbrother tried to let the dog out through the sliding door and I put my hand on it to stop it. The little brat gave me a death glare and my dad is making me apologize to brat and his mom. Yeah, Iâ€™ll apologize to them but the brat can go shove a brick shit
