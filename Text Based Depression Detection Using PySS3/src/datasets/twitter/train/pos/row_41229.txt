My crush have no feelings for my and told me in the face She's my neighbor, and I saw her a long time and after 10 years of watching her, walking across the road, I took the courage to talk to her. She told me, that she was waiting for me to make the first step. So we startet dating, and after 5 dates and 2 bouquets of flowers, she told me, that we should be friends. I think my failure was, that I was too nice and old fashioned to her. I thought everything will turn into a happy end, but now we don't talk to each other, 'cause I can't have a platonic friendship with her without wanting more. Meanwhile idk if I should change and don't me too nice and old fashioned to girls again.
