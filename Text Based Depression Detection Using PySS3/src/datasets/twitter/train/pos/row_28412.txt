Mental health 

Self esteem and mental health are really important. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I want to cry. I hate everything about myself. These thoughts are too much and sometimes I feel like ripping my hair out.

What sucks the most is that I'm a guy. I don't believe in the, "Boys don't cry" bs but the people around me do. And I hate it. I just want cry in a pillow or have someone hold me whilst I cry and vent about all my insecurities. But my mindset isn't in the place to be mocked by the people around me. I feel like I've lost all my friends too and its always the people I care about the most who end up hurting me the most. Whenever I try to tell people about my problems they just complain about me being annoying and I should stop joking around and be serious for once. They never try to understand.

My opinion are always being shut out too. People just ignore me and talk to someone else. Never replying to my messages etc. And if I don't text first then there won't be a conversation in the first place. I used to be so extroverted as a kid but I was always getting bullied because of the way I looked. Not just by people in my class or my year group but older people too. Just coming up to me at lunch and insulting or sometimes hitting me. The teachers just shout at them and say it won't happen again but it always does. I'm tired of everything.

Anyways, enough about me. Hope everything's going well for you.
