Last night's dream was particularly strange. I needed a date to my dad's wedding (a third marriage I was not particularly happy about.) So I threw on a purple, long sleeved, sequined dress and some black heels, and I pulled out my phone to look for a date. For some reason, I had Nick Jonas's number. (And this is weird because I have never liked the Jonas Brothers, or Nick Jonas.) So I called him and asked if he'd be my date to the wedding, to which he said "Why wouldn't I be, I'm your boyfriend." So I called and made reservations at this super fancy restaurant that overlooks the beach. I called him when I got there, and he said he was on his way. The waiter led me to a private room and seated me. After a bit, a woman came out of a door I had not noticed, and sat down. She told me Nick Jonas was not coming because he went to go save "our" baby and died in a fire. She told me that I needed to go save the baby, instead. So I went to the burning house, I stepped over Nick Jonas's dead body and scooped up a baby, and saved it. Only it turned out to be a baby doll, and the real baby was still in the house.
