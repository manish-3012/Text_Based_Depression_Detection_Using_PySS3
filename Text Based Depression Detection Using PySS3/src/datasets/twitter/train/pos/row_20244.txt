I really need help with this. Please So my friend (let's call her Mindy) has spread rumors about multiple people even as far as saying that my other friend (We'll call him Dylan) put his hand under her top while taking pictures even though she was uncomfortable.
She even doesn't hangout with us very much and has done some annoying sh*t but whenever she was there, she  has been a good friend to me except a couple times, but even I am not great friend.

Now I and Dylan and two of my other friends one day had a discussion and decided that we will stop communicating with Mindy. After a while I felt guilty and missed her a little so I apologized. We agreed to meet but she didnt read my text. Now when Dylan and the other two friends found about it they felt betrayed and asked me why I did it.

Now I want to end things with Mindy but I can't. Should I even do it cause she hasn't been terrible to me much. In fact I think I am the bad guy by sending mixed signals to both Mindy and Dylan.
