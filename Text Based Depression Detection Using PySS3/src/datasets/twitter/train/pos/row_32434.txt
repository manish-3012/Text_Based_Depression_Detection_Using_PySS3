my family never listens to anything i say and i feel so put down all the time iâ€™m the second born/youngest and i live with both of my parents and my brother. anytime i talk iâ€™m always talked over or interrupted. if i say something about it then my parents put me down and my dad gets mad at me for â€œhaving an attitudeâ€. my brother is off and on with this girl and every time theyâ€™re together he yells at me because i breathe too loud or other things like that. if i say something they donâ€™t agree with they put me down. and after they make me upset i clearly donâ€™t want to talk (which iâ€™m really quiet outside of my house as it is) and they get mad at me because iâ€™m crabby. then they say â€œwhy are you crabbyâ€ and if i tell them they get mad and if i donâ€™t they still get mad. iâ€™m always in my room by myself because iâ€™m scared to go downstairs and talk because i think theyâ€™ll get mad. 

thanks for coming to my ted talk
