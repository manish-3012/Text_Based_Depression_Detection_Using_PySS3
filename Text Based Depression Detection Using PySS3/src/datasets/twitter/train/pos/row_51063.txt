"...And I'd rather you shave your head and learn interesting cuisines and lose yourself in international sojourns to come back tan, tough, and wise -- than to just shut a door you'll never open again and go pale and cold." I took this from a comment somewhere, one that I made. I like how I put it, admitting also that this may be a little selfish to say so. But! I also was sad that the full comment's half-hour of effort never earned any readers. So I figured I'd lift it up here. 


If you agree that attempting a wild life or living in radical changes is BETTER than ending your life altogether, even if by a very small net value: please raise your hand with me.
