Ok PSA time ***possible trigger warning***: The whole "Boys in Skirts" thing didn't make you gay out of nowhere. Unless that was your thing already, obviously. Your brain got tricked into thinking they were women. Your horny brain went "OOOHHH thats a MATE!!!!!!!1!"

Or maybe it did somehow, idk. But that's my take on it.

I'll mention again: **THIS ONLY APPLIES TO STRAIGHT PEOPLE**
