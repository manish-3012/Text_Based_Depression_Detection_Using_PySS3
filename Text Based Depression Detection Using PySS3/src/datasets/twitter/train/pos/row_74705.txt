My friend's girl friend I was with my friend Tobias we were going to visit his girlfriend. Tobias told me that he had insects in his stomach, because he loved her so much. When we arrived she sat down in a very beautiful house with a lot of cool lamps. "This is exciting Simone, for twenty euros she always falls in love with me!" Exciting Simone laughed at us with her dry lips. "Come we go the ATM," when we were back at the house were the curtains closed and Tobias started to cry and rant and probably his stomach still hurt. "No, no, now is that other man probably here..." When I looked up I saw the man coming out of the house and said: "Don't worry Tobias. It's just my dad and he already has a wife!" :)
