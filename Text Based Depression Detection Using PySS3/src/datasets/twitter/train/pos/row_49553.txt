Itâ€™s currently 1am, I have my hand shoved in a bowl of slightly cold water, because I accidentally burnt the whole entire palm of my hand with boiling water because I was trying to make ramen noodles in the dark, and thatâ€™s the only thing making it feel slightly okay I also love how nobody in my house was concerned about hearing someone yell â€œFUCKâ€ from the kitchen
