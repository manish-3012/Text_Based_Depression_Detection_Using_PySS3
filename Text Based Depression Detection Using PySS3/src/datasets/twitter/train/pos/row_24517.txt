I hate it when people are disappointed in me but Iâ€™m always such a disappointment For me thereâ€™s seriously no worse feeling on earth than someone being disappointed in me or angry at me for something I did wrong, but the problem is I literally cannot live up to expectations because I suck at everything.
And so when I inevitably disappoint someone I can never look at them the same or truly feel close to them, like I either canâ€™t forgive myself or I canâ€™t forgive them.
And then I end up disliking them in my mind, and the thought of them makes me angry, even though I know itâ€™s me whoâ€™s in the wrong. But thatâ€™s the only way I know how to cope with it. Even when I do forgive myself for messing up or doing something poorly, then I canâ€™t forgive the other person for being angry at me. So Iâ€™m just constantly angry at them in my mind, or I force myself to look down on them. I know itâ€™s messed up but itâ€™s just what I do.
