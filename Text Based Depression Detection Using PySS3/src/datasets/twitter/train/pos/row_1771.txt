Why did a guy lied to me about having a girlfriend when he had a crush on me? This took place a year ago and I'm suddenly remembering it for some reason

I had a guy friend who announced to me (and our mutual friends) that he had a girlfriend. I said, "congrats" to him and didn't give much thought to it.

Until when he started saying cheesy/flirty things to me
and initiated to hang out together which I usually respond with, "don't you have a girlfriend to do that with?" 

and sometimes he would tell me that he's going to blah blah place with his girlfriend and even tell me what they would be doing there, and i would be like, "alright, that's cool ðŸ‘" 

and then this continued along with our daily, random conversations until one day, he admitted that he has a crush on me and he never had a girlfriend to begin with. i told him that i have always seen him as a friend and he said he knows.

then we drifted and never talked again ðŸ˜ƒ

but now I'm just wondering why did he go such lengths to create an imaginary girlfriend when he had a crush on me??
