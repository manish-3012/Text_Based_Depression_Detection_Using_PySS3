Guys, some dude went to the principals office earlier. So, he started a fight between 2 blind kids and whilst they were frantically wrestling on the ground, he yelled â€œHES GOT A FUCKING KNIFE!â€ And they both scrambled up and took off, running into each other and other random obstacles. After coming back from that principal visit, later in another class, he told a deaf kid to hear him out. After that principle visit, he told a kid with a speech impediment to just say what he was trying to say when he wouldnâ€™t stop stuttering. He got sent home for the rest of the day.
