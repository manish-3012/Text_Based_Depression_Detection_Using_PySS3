Should i apologize? Every day during online class my mom comes into my room and tells me to unmute my mic and talk to the teacher even when we have nothing to talk about, she says she does it to "boost my confidence" but it bothers me because i answer all the questions the teachers ask me and try to be attentive in class but it's hard to do it when she is standing over me and constantly telling me to unmute so for the last 6 months i've had online classes i have calmly been telling her that she should stop doing that but she doesn't listen so a few days ago i got mad and yelled at her and left online class and now she hasn't talked to me in 2 days and keeps telling my sisters to tell me to apologize but i am not going to apologize because it's not my fault atleast that's what i think, do you think it's my fault?
