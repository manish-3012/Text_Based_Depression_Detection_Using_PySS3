I have a rant for you all. (Read or don't, I don't care, I just have to right it out.) So I joined a mock trial club a few months back. Thought it would be fun, broaden my horizons. It was fun at first, it was interesting, but then the assignments started rolling in. I realized I had no idea what the fuck i was doing and pretty soon the main thing I had to write was a week past due. I basically just ghosted the team and tried to come up with something for my main closing argument, and then I managed to pull something together that was passable, I guess. next thing I know, the competition is tomorrow, I haven't gone to a meeting in weeks, and the team has no idea what happened to me. the team captain said if you dont show up to todays meeting, your can't compete. I start feeling conflicted, cause i know im gonna be a burden but if i bail their gonna have to find a replacement for me. keep in mind the comp is tomorrow. so write out this huge rambling email about how i fucked up, essentially. now my nerves are all on edge waiting for a reply, so yeah. thank you for letting me waist your time.
