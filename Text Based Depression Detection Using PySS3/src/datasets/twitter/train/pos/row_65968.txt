You have the same good circle of friends for long enough There are going to be certain stories you will share that are never to be repeated within earshot Of certain individuals that may or may not be sworn to enforce certain ordinances agreed upon by most of civilization.

By that of course I'm talking about civil engineers..lol

 You would never want to tell a "civil engineer"....  Things like what happened in Miami the summer before last...  Or howor why  I hid in a shed for 2 days in Rome,  Why Maddox  Got kicked out of  Lithuanian  The day after his 18th,  For what happened in Alaska our senior year.

 Those are just some stories that can never be repeated around civil engineers or certain people's parents ...
 When you have a group of good friends for long enough you everyone in that circle has at least one story about them that is never to be repeated unless you know..
