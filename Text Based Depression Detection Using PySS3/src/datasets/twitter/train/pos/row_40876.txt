I want y'all's opinion on smth So before i ask the question i want to wrap up some things.

Im a 16-year-old bisexual boy and I love listening to Billie Eillish

My friends really think that that is abnormal and quite weird 

And honestly im starting to doubt it myself

Do you think that i should stop?
