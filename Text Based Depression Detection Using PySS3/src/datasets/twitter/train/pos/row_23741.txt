I need to vent Im not happy with my body, my nan tells me and my sister to suck in our stomachs, my friends mom talks about me to her and to add onto that her mom yelled at me for using to much salt, saying i eat to much, and sometimes i cant understand anything, i fucking hate my school, i hate my house, my house is only three rooms, mine and my sisters room, living room/my parents room, and the bathroom, its so small and cramped, all i hear is my sisters 24/7, they are so loud and it makes my head spin, i dont like loud noises.... loud noises scare me... i dont like loud noises.... i feel trapped... like im stuck in a cage...
