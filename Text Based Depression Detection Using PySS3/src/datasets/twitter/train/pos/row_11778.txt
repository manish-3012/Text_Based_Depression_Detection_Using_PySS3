Question for relationships Question, if someone is a one grade lower and a year younger, would it be weird to date or am I just stupid? 

I do have a crush on a boy ( the year younger and Iâ€™m a year older than him ) but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s be weird if we like started dating? Iâ€™m not sure what my friends would think (I met the boy through a friend and probably a couple would think itâ€™s ok) or my classmates. 

Iâ€™m also 80% he likes me too so, yay(?)
