To the Trans and the Superstraight First of all i want to start off by saying superstraight is  very stupid
Coming from a Straight person 

Superstraight can come off as very offensive to trans people as basicaly the whole community is transphobic
That being said

Not dating trans people because they are trans is not transphobic
And yall need to stop saying that
For example
I would only date cisgender women

Does that mean I hate trans people? 
No, it just means i wouldnt be in a relationship with trans women or trans men thats it
If ur a trans woman i respect u as a woman
If ur a trans man i respect u as a man

But AGAIN im only attracted to cisgender women



I dont get why so many people r pushing the (not dating trans people because they are trans is transphobic) shit becuase its simply not



I only made this post because i have some people always telling me this to the point where its like they want to force me into dating a trans person
