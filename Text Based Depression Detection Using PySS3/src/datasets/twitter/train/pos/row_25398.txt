Class of 2021 Reviving an old advice column I did a few years back called "class of 2019" If I learned it and it didn't land me in the can overnight, well then y'all can keep it

Now after graduation, you're gonna lose touch with a lot of close people in your life over a very short period of time. Sucks, yeah. 

Remind people you care about them with a year subscription to thrasher magazine. It's just under $18 for the full year, and they get a thrasher t with their first issue. This is not a paid endorsement, I am not affiliated with thrasher in any way shape or form beyond a published letter that I sent from my time in county jail.

They will not renew your subscription, so don't worry about getting caught up paying someone's shit every year, and Beverly's always been cool about switching the sending location whenever you need, just send thrasher an email and they'll have it done by the end of the day.

Thrasher is also allowed in any state or federal correctional facility, as well as inpatient mental facility.

I started doing this when my cousin went down on a RICO and I do it every time my friend gets hemmed up or wants to change their life in a positive way. 

It also happens to be the greatest magazine since lowrider monthly, or maybe the pinup editions of inked. (All of which are also allowed in prison) 

Happy Holidays out there, be safe, and remember
Be good to yourself, and eachother.
