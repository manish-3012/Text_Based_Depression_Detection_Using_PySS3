Why are some parents so obsessed with acne?  I mean my mom is so obsessed with it that she thinks me having acne will â€œembarrassâ€ me at school. Despite the fact that literally nobody at school cares and wouldnâ€™t care at all as lots of them also have acne problems. Why do you think there like this?
