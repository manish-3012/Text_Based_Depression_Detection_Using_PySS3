I need some serious advice So I've been talking to my fried. I like to jokingly flirt with him occasionally because its fun. But like I've noticed both of our reactions have changed recently. Even going as far as him kissing me on the cheek once. (Note he was wearing a mask and I was in a gp-5 soviet gas mask). Tonight I sent him a paragraph talking a little bit about it. "Listen idfk how but this has kept me up, ig I just need to know how you feel. So homiesexual meaning  a friendship with a little gay. I have always flirted with you in a homisexual way although there have been times when it was sort of nice to get a response back, like the smile you get when someone you like responds to you. Those times confuse me because when I flirt its normally just bullshit friend stuff but idk sometimes its great and idk man. I'm not asking you out I guess I just need closure or something LMAO who woulda thought, me needing closure from you, the guy I normally flirt with as a joke.." for this paragraph tl;dr I've sort of thought of some of the non serious flirting getting more serious.

He responded "I think its nice" and I honestly hot weird vibes from that. Because Normally wheb i talk about something serious his responses are a little longer than that. Idk why I'm coming to reddit for this. I guess I just needed some advice or maybe someone outside of the friend group to talk about it.
