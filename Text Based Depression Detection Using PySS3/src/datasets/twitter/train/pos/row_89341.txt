I have a bit of a dilemma on my hands Ok so my situation is that Iâ€™m basically a mega virgin (unlike most people on this subreddit Iâ€™m sure). I havenâ€™t had my first kiss or a girlfriend. Last night I was on the phone with two of my friends who are girls, and one of them was like â€œI need a FWBâ€ and the other one was like â€œWhat about IRex1010â€ and I was just there sitting in silence. The rest of the conversation basically went that both of these friends want a FWB relationship, and now they want a three way kind of FWB relationship with me. Except thereâ€™d be no sex, it would just be making out. Now I donâ€™t know what to do. On one hand Iâ€™d like to have a girlfriend, because Iâ€™d want to have my first kiss with someone I really care about and who I have romantic feelings towards. Also, idk if hookups are my thing and it feels like Iâ€™m diving into the deep end here. On the other hand, Iâ€™m horny and maybe having experience with kissing and stuff will make things better when I do eventually get a girlfriend. I canâ€™t talk to any of my irl friends about this, because most of them know the two girls and they want to keep it a secret so I donâ€™t know what to do.
