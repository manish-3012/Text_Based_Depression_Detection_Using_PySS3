Everyday is the fucking same. And i dont even know how to feel about it Its like life is a mess
But a mess that repeats itself over and over
This was real even before quarantine and shit, i dont really do anything interesting, i will probably feel this way forever but idk im not like sad or something, im just.... i dont feel much anymore, i dont feel really happy or sad, i feel numb, its hard to get out of bed.

Music is the only thing that made me go trough this boring ass life, sometimes i have just, scary thoughts and sometimes i think about ending it all, music kinda silences this thought
