How can I make conversations flow a little easier There have been times where I talk to someone and there arenâ€™t that many awkward silences but that doesnâ€™t happen that much tbh. I just donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s me or the other person thatâ€™s making it awkward. Like well just stop talking and weâ€™ll have no idea what to say to each other. I REALLY hate when that happens. It also annoys me when the other person doesnâ€™t give me the opportunity to speak. I have a friend that I really like talking to but I gotta admit she talks so much about her own ideas and her own life, she doesnâ€™t really give me the opportunity to speak. Every time I try to talk I have to interrupt to get a word in, itâ€™s exhausting. Then sheâ€™ll ask me why I donâ€™t talk much. The opposite is kind of annoying too(I know I get annoyed easily.) Someone who just expects me to take control of the conversation puts too much pressure on me. It has to be even both ways if that makes sense. 

Iâ€™d like to know if you have any ideas how I can be better at talking to people. I realized that I try the conversation moving too fast so I just donâ€™t really understand what the other person is saying that much. I finish other peoples words for them which probably isnâ€™t a good thing. I accidentally interrupt them and Iâ€™ve been called annoying before so I really donâ€™t want to come off that way. At the same time, I donâ€™t want to be shy because Iâ€™ve been called that too. I wish I could just talk to people better
