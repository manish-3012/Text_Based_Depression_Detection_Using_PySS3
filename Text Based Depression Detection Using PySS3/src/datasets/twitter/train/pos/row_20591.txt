In a sea of humans uncharted I trail behind my warden on a lead made of manipulation and authority.

This is the day humankind rushes stores, paying though the nose for little nothings they'll never need.

This is the day I have been chosen to help relieve the strain of worthless temptations from the shoulders of a parent.

A sting of cold glass as the shoving match of the cattle behind consumes the last smidgen of personal space I'd taken for granted

A wide-eyed victim creeps towards the stores lock, a thin transparent shield the only thing saving him from the suddenly surging mass.

Click, slam, screams, shove, stumble. Crunch, agony, pressure. Bombardment, crashing feet, utter frenzy.

The feet of a thousand shoes flattens the air of my lungs, the contents of my stomach. Thick wine flows from my limbs. 

No one noticed the knees they crushed. No one noticed the juice of eyeballs popping onto their sneakers. No one noticed the steady beat of a head slamming against concrete.

No one cares.
