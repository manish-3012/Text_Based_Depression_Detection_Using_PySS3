As I was rummaging through my fridge I realized I wasn't hungry... I was just depressed, looking for something new to happen. Something other than dealing with online school, having a mental breakdown, getting yelled at by my parents and watching YouTube as I sit in my room... I'm looking for something new, something exciting. I wanna go out and be somebody but my mom won't let me go out, I have no IRL friends, no computer. Sometimes I feel like strangers and randos on the internet are more.. exciting than any body in my town. I come on here and see ppl jumping off cliffs in the caribbean, streamers getting recognized in public, and grandparents seeing there grandchildren. And then there's me. Some senior rando who's stuck with his family and can't get a job. Stuck in a dark room because the electric is getting too high, in 106Â° weather. I don't know. I always sing [Always Look On The Bright Side](https://youtu.be/SJUhlRoBL8M) but maybe I'm not doing that as of recently.. maybe I'm being hypocritical. I mean, yes I'm living under a roof with a smartphone, in my own room.. maybe I'm just a first world complainer where I complain about the little things and make them look humongous. But I would just like some spice with my potatoes. Y'know? Boiled potatoes is okay but it's not ideal. Again IDK. Maybe I'm being hypocritical. That'd be nothing new unfortunately.

Sorry for the long post, I did not mean for this to turn into a 12 page essay of a rant. I just blanked out for 30 min and my mind said "SPEAK"... again I'm so sorry I'll put a tl;dr

#TL;DR I want something different and exciting to happen with my life
