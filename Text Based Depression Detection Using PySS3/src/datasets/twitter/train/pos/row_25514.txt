For people who need it So I was walking today, and stopped on a bridge for whatever reason. I was having some thinky thoughts about things and such, when I noticed someone had written on a metal beam. I will now paste it here: "Its not fair for you to use a cheat code to finish your game early and leave the rest of us here to finish the hardest levels with one less player... rip KCL" so if anyone is feeling sad, that's something to think about
