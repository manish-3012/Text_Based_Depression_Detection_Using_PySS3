I'm kinda bummed out my crush and I couldn't hang out yesterday. I asked her if she wanted to do something yesterday because it was the last warm sunny day of summer. Now the forecast is just rain and thunder for a loooong time and it would have been nice to do something with her before the shit weather kicks in. She had a lot of homework and other school stuff so that's why we couldn't hang. Sure it's not like we can't do stuff when it's raining but you know. Bad weather is not fun
