Help needed. Guys, recently our city has been hit hard with the second wave of covid (its a rural city so its a bit late) . All the schools around has shut down except ours. The management is adamant about conducting exams. The students have tried to reach out to the school but they have been ignored/left on seen by the management. This petition is our last resort as students. If you have the time i would really appreciate a sign
