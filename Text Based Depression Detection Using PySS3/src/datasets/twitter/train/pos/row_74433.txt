I played among us with my p.e. teacher Right aftrr the class someone asked in the meeting if people wanted to play and some people said yes then someone jokingly asked the teacher if he wanted to play and he actually did! We did 2games and him and the quiet kid were the impostors both time. It was actually fun and he was kinda lost but clearly found it fun (i think)
