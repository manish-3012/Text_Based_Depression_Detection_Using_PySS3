Second post on teenagers today very important I swear I just saw someone say their crush confessed on reddit. My crush definitely likes me, but if I tell him then it might ruin our friendship, also I think he has a gf. But once he said they broke up but sometimes she calls him her "soulmate" and I don't want her to think i'm trying to seperate them. Should I ask if he's dating or should I just confess? I think he sees me as annoying, though nothing has really bothered him, we both have the same sense of humor. I never dated before, and he is my biggest crush. Am I shooting for too much?
