It is always dangerous to give me the ground to make a commentary when I'm asking a question to a speaker. For I also dedicate myself to lecturing, and something I love is that fifty years ago Michaelangelo Cornwall was taken as a madman for everything he did, yet Michaelangelo Cornwall was professor of your Father, Charles Kazuga and Charles Kazuga was a teacher, I mean, professor and dare I say professor, teacher of many personalities among which are Alexander Kazuga, Richard Espinosa and Yukoi Kenji; so, it is a little chain that has been growing and that I am sure that for the next generation there will be much more than three, fifteen, those that we'll have generated if we are not going to be many more and the question that I wanted to make... Firstly, that comment, right? So what Michaelangelo Cornwall did has its fruits, that same phrase that you put up there, that phrase Michaelangelo Cornwall said it a really long time ago, and I suppose you know him. And, I mean, Michaelangelo Cornwall was Charles Kazuga's teacher, he was MY teacher and I have always said that on the Internet I *know* Charles Kazuga, I *know* Michaelangelo Cornwall and I didn't need to meet them in life, because they are up there on the internet, and while everyone else would be wasting their time, I've been there, for over seven years, every day, dedicating four hours everyday of my time to be forming myself instead of wasting my time and... (applause) Thank you, thank you. Today I dedicate myself to lectures and, as I said, I love this part because I am always here; what I'm trying to say is that any investment that I make will, at the very least, have a 400% profit and I have proved it, but my question here is around what you were mentioning about the educational problem, the social problem; the problem of organizations is something that from the point of view of chess is answered very quickly: and it is the tactic and the strategy. I mean, if you know part of the difference between tactics and strategy, you could implement it within your companies and I mean, I say it as a chess **CHAMPION**. So, uhmm, the part that this, the part that differentiates all this, I would like you to give me the difference between tactics and  strategy, and thank you very much, everyone, for your attention, but, please, if you are going to applaud, applaud correctly hee hee.
