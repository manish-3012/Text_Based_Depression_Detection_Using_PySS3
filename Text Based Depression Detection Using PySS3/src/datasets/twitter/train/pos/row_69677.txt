Thereâ€™s a bot following me and I would like some advice I know I shouldnâ€™t post this here, but my post in r/help got removed. I got a message in my inbox that said that someone started following me. I checked the account and noticed it was a bot. I noticed it posted a link to a porn site. I obviously didnâ€™t open it because I donâ€™t trust in bots or people I donâ€™t know. I already blocked the account, but I wanted to know if I could report it or something. Iâ€™m sorry for posting this here but I need some advice from people my age.
