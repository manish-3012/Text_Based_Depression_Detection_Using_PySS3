I hate that henry danger was on air longer than icarly Fucking what? I've been looking up nick sitcoms from when i was in elementary school, and i was surprised to find out that henry danger only ended on march 31st if this year. That is too long. The show wasn't even good.



Also, sam and cat only got 1 season.
