Iâ€™m getting myself very confused. So like, when I manage to talk with my girlfriend (cuz sheâ€™s busy most of the time) itâ€™s just like, one or two nicknames a goodnight small love you etc etc.

But when I talk with my homie itâ€™s just shit tok of nicknames non stop i love you non stop compliments non stop saying good morning and goodnight and just acting more like a couple than I do with my gf.

So Iâ€™m not sure whether is it because i donâ€™t talk to my gf as much cuz she has school and my homie has online school and we talk all day and I generally vent to her more because my girlfriend has strong anxiety and I donâ€™t want to weigh her down with my trauma baggage and shit or what the fuck is it.

And before someone asks yes I talked to my girlfriend about it and she doesnâ€™t mind me venting to my homie and shit like that cuz she isnâ€™t too good at handling that.

It might be also because both me and my homie have very strong signs of a few disorders (anxiety, impostor syndrome, I might have adhd and she might have add, depression) and shit like that so idk, and my homie is the therapist friend in the group except there is no friend group cuz sheâ€™s my only friend.
