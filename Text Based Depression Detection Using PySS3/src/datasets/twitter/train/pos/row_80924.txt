So my choice of clothing I like to dress simple a long sleeve shirt probably solid color. Blue or black jeans. And I have one thing out of the ordinary. I know itâ€™s too hot. I know I look dumb. And people donâ€™t like long coats.**But I fucking love my parka**. Yes I know long coats really arenâ€™t something you should wear(especially when your some fucking white guy) but I barely give a fuck. Look I want to be buried in this thing. Something of a theifâ€™s pride. I somehow ended up with a highschool swim parka *that probably should have been returned* but oh well. Donâ€™t tag me a fucking school shooter cause Iâ€™m wearing an oversized blanket. (Plus itâ€™s water resistant so I can use it in rain)
