Hey girls and guys, I have a question What clothes look 

1. cute/cuddly  
2. hot  
3. good 

on people of your preferred gender? I am a straight guy, and these are what I think.  
   
1. Sweaters/sweat shirts, sweatpants, loose jeans, some shorts  
2. Sweat shirts, T shirts, some long sleeves, turtlenecks, skinny jeans, yoga pants, loose/tight shorts  
3. T shirts, (3 button button downs are really nice looking) jeans, some long sleeves, long/short skirts look good on a lot of girls  


Glasses can also fit in each category.   


Now hair

I'd say my favorite hair style on girls is long and slightly wavy hair, second favorite is neck length soft hair but not necessarily smooth and straight. My favorite natural hair color is brown. My favorite dye hair color is actually just brown to bleached fade, with bleached being the ends. orange hair is also sometimes cute.
