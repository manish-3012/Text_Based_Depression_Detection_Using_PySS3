Iâ€™m scared for my LDR. So, my SO and I, live in different countries. Him being in the US, and me in Canada. Iâ€™m going to university sometime in 2021, and Iâ€™m unsure of whether we can be together at that point or not. You see, heâ€™s 15, and Iâ€™m 17. Iâ€™m old enough to start going off on my own. Him...? Not so much. He had super strict parents. Iâ€™m not ready to live in an apartment on my own, so I think Iâ€™m going to live on-campus. The only affordable residence on-campus is a double room. Which, Iâ€™m okay with... if it didnâ€™t mean less privacy, and less of a chance of me being able to video call my SO every night like I normally do. Iâ€™m really worried about us losing touch due to an even harder weight on our distance. Weâ€™re both nervous and sad after I brought it up to him. I donâ€™t think weâ€™ll end up breaking up, but Iâ€™m just so worried. In order for him to move out at a certain age, Iâ€™d have to have my own apartment. Itâ€™s just... a mess. I donâ€™t know if any of this makes sense, I just need some sort of reassurance, advice, or similar situations. Any other LDR survivors out there??
