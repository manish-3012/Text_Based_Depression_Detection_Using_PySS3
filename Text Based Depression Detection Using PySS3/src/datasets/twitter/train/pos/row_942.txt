I should probably pace myself since this is like the 3rd time I've uploaded in 24 hours, but heres an acoustic cover of Pompeji by Deftones that I just did. https://youtu.be/dGoYoWWuqR4



I'm actually really happy with how this sounds on an acoustic, especially cause the song originally uses an 8 string guitar. Plus I learned it mostly by ear so I'm kinda proud of that. Enjoy!
