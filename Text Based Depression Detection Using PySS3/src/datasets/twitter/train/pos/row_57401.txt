The middle child is worse than the oldest child, change my mind. The oldest child always complain how they are getting no love and shit. But being the middle child is 10x worse, so how it works is if something happens the parent will of course start to find someone to blame. They start by thinking that the youngest child is too innocent and precious to do it. And then the oldest child is too responsible and smart to do it. This is especially worse if the age gap between the youngest-middle and middle-oldest is big (Example: 7 - 13 -19). One of the most frustrating things is being compared to your big brother/sister over the smallest things making you look like a dumbass. But of course, every child has their own advantages but the middle child is somewhat worse.
