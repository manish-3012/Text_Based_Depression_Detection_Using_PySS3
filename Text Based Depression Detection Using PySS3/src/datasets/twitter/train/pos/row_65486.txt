Girls I need advice. Her brother called her flat, she pushed him over and she came to me and I just didnâ€™t know what to say? Do I say â€œyouâ€™re not flatâ€ which is true but like I donâ€™t wanna objectify her. I just said â€œidk what to say right nowâ€ and she said â€œyou donâ€™t need to say anythingâ€ but she seemed sad. I probably should of said something like â€œyouâ€™re perfectâ€ which yet again is true, but Iâ€™m just not sure how girls feel about their tits. What should I have said?
