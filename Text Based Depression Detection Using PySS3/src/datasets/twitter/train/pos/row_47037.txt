anyone else laugh and smile excessively when theyâ€™re nervous or uncomfortable Idk Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m a person that smiles a lot and usually itâ€™s because I donâ€™t feel good in that situation. Once I was telling this story and I couldnâ€™t stop laughing but the story wasnâ€™t even funny but someone told me itâ€™s not even funny so why am I laughing. I was just really anxious talking in front of so many people and itâ€™s like my automatic reaction. I also think it makes me seem really weird
