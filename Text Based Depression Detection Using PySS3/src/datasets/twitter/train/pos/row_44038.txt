sad life:( NOTE: my english isn't that much good so i hope so y'all understand

so I really didn't feel any depression or never really cared about others who are going through depression but today I fakin felt how hard is depression, depression is really a pure shit it was something like i gotta cry multiple times until my eyes goes dry. If anyone of y'all are going through depression, i beg you all please, please, please find someone to talk about with your problems. that's all..
