I have been internalizing all of my rage for the past 2-3 weeks and today, I have had it. if I don't do something about it, I will simply cease. (possible TW? I talk about my mom yelling at me and briefly explain what exactly she was saying.) Ok, so where to start. how about with the fact that for the record, I know my mom is stressed do hell and back. but so is everyone else. I am, my sister is, and if she ever took a moment to pay attention to the emotions of others around her, she'd realize that we all have our own god damned issues. I'm trying to cram my entire high school career into a single year and *I'm pretty sure I'm gonna fuck that up.* so yea***.*** sorry if I don't always have the time or energy to do the dishes. even ignoring the fact that *there isn't even a full sink yet.* and I really am sorry***.*** I do the best I can every day and that's just not a lot sometimes. and I know the cat boxes need to be taken out. it honestly slipped my mind today. it doesn't make me an irresponsible person. she never takes her head out of her ass long enough to realize that she yells *all the time****.*** she just *does it* with no care for how my day was or how I've been feeling. And last week, I realized I'm not crying because I've just gone at least partially numb. I just, *leak tears* after what I would have *used* to consider a traumatic experience. it's not a lot of tears but at least I've noticed something happening. and I really make an effort. I rarely yell and I do my best to be understanding of how she's feeling. and because my sister doesn't do anything all day besides sit around and watch the same shows over and over again I can't even just be home alone and scream for a while. *which is something I used to do.* like at least once a week. now, I can't do *anything* to destress for myself besides beat off. and that isn't something that exactly helps with infuriating, skull-shattering, rage. I have had it up to ***HERE*** with the *yelling*, and the *screaming*, and the drama of just... *living here*. like, I swear to god. Tomorrow, I'm just going to wake up, do my chores, and do my morning class, and just walk to the highway and back. screaming my god damn lungs out half of the way there.(edited)I haven't been able to sit in my own living room with mom home for more than 20 minutes before she finds something to yell at me about. I feel sick to my stomach now. no clue why. that's probably not good. *anyway,* my sister rarely does *anything.* she is 25. she goes *days* without doing anything. not even folding laundry. and mom never yells at her for not doing anything. even when it's something *I* would lose my fucking eardrums for. it's completely unfair. and when I point this out to mom, she tells me how my sister does nothing way less often. she completely ignores the fact that she never yells at her, even when I point it out and just says I'm trying to pin something on my sister, and I get yelled at *more!* and then***,*** there's ***today******.*** today, she needed to find some proof she paid my shitty dad for a month of my brother's social security or whatever. the money doesn't matter she just couldn't find any bank records, emails, or pictures of checks to use as proof. so you know, she's extra stressed. ***wonderful.*** so she starts just ***going*** ***off*** on how I didn't do shit today. which I didn't. I'm mentally tired. I am this close to collapsing, only to get immediately back up and scream for four hours straight. I needed a day to just, *sit.* sit, draw, and play a little sonic 2 on my 3ds. but all of that was for naught because she came home and damn near immediately started yelling about the dishes. so she finishes what she has to say, I apologize and tell her I'll do them tomorrow. there is no longer any point in explaining myself. she will just call my completely valid reason an excuse and just yell some more. anyway***,*** then she had me and my sister make our own dinner. we did so. And after, I asked mom if she was too busy to watch a show. she didn't respond. which is normal whenever she's on her phone. so I ask again. and before I can even finish my sentence she tells me that the fact that she's ignoring me should've been a clue. I tell her she literally always ignores us when she's on her phone. she then starts yelling again. at this point, I've had enough. I tell her she doesn't need to be an asshole and go sit on the couch. she basically talks to herself for another 2 minutes and I'm completely ignoring what she's saying. I have ***completely*** had it by this point. and then after a while, she gets done with whatever she's doing and I'm sitting in the middle room on my laptop. she asks me to come watch a show as if nothing happened and everything is fine until we get done. because she found that the cat shit somewhere she shouldn't. she started yelling again and I again, immediately walked away. again, completely done. then, instead of cleaning it up herself, you know, like a normal person, she just gets in the shower and expects me to clean it up. she was literally right there and didn't do anything about it. mind you, I was already on the other end of the house. I thought she cleaned it up. I didn't pay any more mind to it. which apparently, ***was my final mistake as a mortal being.*** so I get my various chargers and go to my room. and sit down. I then first messaged you to talk about my shit. and then all hell broke loose! because she expected me to clean up something that she found and had access to all the tools to clean up and deal with much more easily than I. and before she may have yelled, but then, she was ***screaming*** dude. she just went off about how I never do anything and how I don't even take care of my own animals and how hard *her own* life is***.*** Like***,*** really? wow. I had no idea exactly what you're going through on a daily basis. I've never literally currently right now dealt with the exact same thing all the time at the same time as you are. never ever***.*** ***OH WAIT*** YES I FUCKING HAVE. But she doesn't see it that way at all does she? not even a bit. nobody else has ever had as hard of a life as her. she's the only one who's ever right, and she has no reason to listen to anyone else. and so she gets done, and I don't even respond. I have nothing to say. I have no words that could possibly express how fucking ***done*** I am in that moment. I wait for her to go to her room, I sit with my other cat for a while on my bed, and then I started venting to my friend. I refuse to speak to mom tomorrow I swear to god. 

anyway I initially sent this to a friend. I removed names and decided to post it here. maybe I could've made sure the cat shit was cleaned up but mind you, I was completely done with existing at that point. and regardless, her reaction was completely uncalled for.

k I'mma sleep soon. feel free to ask questions or whatever. I'll probably be up for a little while so whatevs
