I honestly fucking hate my classmates. I honestly can't express how fucking angry I am at these idiots, I am crying right now and  and wish I could beat every single one of them into a fucking pulp.
Here's what happened:  when we entered the room for our last subject during online school some of my classmates had fake names such as "webex supprt", the teacher see this and kindly asks for them to get out, change their names and get back in, but they didn't listen and the were just saying random things like "this is webex support how can we help you" with an indian like accent.This continued until it got boring and when the teacher decided to to share her screen with all the paintings she wanted to show us and all of a sudden these mother fuckers started yelling "press alt and f4" or "is that a black guy over there". Unfortunately she messed up because of them and closed fer folder accidentaly and started worrying.Honestly the look in her eyes and everyone laughing just filled filled me with anger. After all that she kinda got tired and just said "I thought you were a good class" and "noone has caused me as much trouble as you". Honeslty when she opened the folder again she seemed so done her happy mood turned into fatigue and wanna know the worst part? THESE FUCKS DIDN'T EVEN STOP, like honestly how can you feel such little remorse for someone who didn't do anything to you. Honestly seeing her being taken advantage of just shows me how immature most of my classmates are.

Sorry if I look like a drama queen but I really wanted to get this out.
