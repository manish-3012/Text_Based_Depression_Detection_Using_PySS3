A 10 year old called me racist. Me and my friend were just talking, about nothing really, probably about like throwing a baby out of a car at 55 mph (if you want context Iâ€™ll let you know), and this 10 year old kid called me racist. He didnâ€™t hear our conversation and he just left after saying that. After he walked away me and my friend just burst out in laughter. I told my friend, â€œitâ€™s true, but what does that have to do with everything?â€ Memory now forever engraved on my mind.
