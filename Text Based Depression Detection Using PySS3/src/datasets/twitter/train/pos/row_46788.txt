I almost fucking died today I honestly donâ€™t know anymore I feel like any day now something is gonna happen and Iâ€™m gonna die I have anxiety and somewhat depression but itâ€™s not consistent Iâ€™m not suicidal in any way but I just feel like something is gonna happen. One moment Iâ€™m having a blast then one minute Iâ€™m depressed and in my feels. But anyways I was checking my dads gun because I was checking if one of the mags I bought today would fit fine in it. our family is big into guns all safe and everything but I just wasnâ€™t thinking and when I set the rifle in the corner with a loaded mag in it and it bumped against the action and went off with the barrel pointed at my head... i just stood there and almost passed out thinking what my parents would have to go through coming into there room wondering why a gun went off and just seeing.... well you know. It was a very surreal feeling and I donâ€™t know why but by the grace of God Iâ€™m still alive. Thatâ€™s just one of things that have happened to me recently but maybe Iâ€™m just lucky/unlucky idk if anyone will even see this but everyone stay safe and hang in there.
