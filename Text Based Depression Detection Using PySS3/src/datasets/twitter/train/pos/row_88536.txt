So I accidentally got a girlfriend and I'm not mad So basically, I have this group chat with a bunch of friends. I had a fake marriage with his dude and divorced him and some how it turned into me and this girl running away to hawaii, painting on the beach and living our dream life. (Started as jokes) And now she texted me "are we actually dating?" I said "if you want to, I won't mind" and she went "up too you I don't mind too" and I said "okay guess we're dating for real then". She really nice so it's great :)
