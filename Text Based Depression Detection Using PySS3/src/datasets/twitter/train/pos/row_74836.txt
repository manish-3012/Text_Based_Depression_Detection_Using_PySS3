I really hate my body  my older bro used an online calculator to measure how much I should eat, he said I should eat 230 calories a day (since I'm not that active), &amp; I kinda believed him for a while, but then my mom started getting mad at me for not eating enough. I try to be more active so that I can eat more, but my brother keeps telling me that it's not gonna work cuz the "workout" that I do isn't that intense. My mom keeps telling me that I'm thin &amp; that I shouldn't lose more weight, but he disagrees &amp; honestly so do I. I'm just so sick of this whole thing &amp; idk what to do, I'm really unhappy abt my body &amp; even though I barely ate for a while I haven't lost weight yet.
