Listen to my theory I think I just blew my own fucking mind

All living organisms have a drive to live and not be dead, right? Well why is this? We know the answer to this, itâ€™s because death is beneficial to all living species, it allows a need for replicating/bearing offspring, eventually over time the organisms keep becoming  more and more optimized and better at surviving/inhabiting the world.. so what if the reason there is an innate drive to bear offspring and continually become more and more optimized, is because there will come a time where all life eventually produces one singular perfect organism that will be virtually immortal, thus being god..
