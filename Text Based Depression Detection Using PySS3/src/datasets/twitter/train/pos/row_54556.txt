17(M), looking for friends, skater/hippie/alt vibes and fashion :) 17(M), looking for friends, skater/hippie/alt vibes and fashion :)
Hey o, so Iâ€™m 17 (almost 18) and I have longish brown super curly hair, with amber coloured eyes, and a semi fit build, I have essentially no sense of fashion sense I like to wear essentially everything(wavy and free clothes are peak tho), and I like to occasionally play games(ps5 and switch), I spend a lot of time seeing my friends and doing dumb and dangerous things with a skate board or whatever else, I do quite like the city life and find that vibe to be really appealing, I also just like to spend a lot of time just listening to music and vibing, but it would be cool to find someone to chill and chat with as friends, definitely in my age bracket and itâ€™s definitely a huge bonus if you have snap :)
