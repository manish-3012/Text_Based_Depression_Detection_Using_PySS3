Anyone up for a bit of a chat? Iâ€™m here, and as you can probably tell, Iâ€™m quite bored. 

About me? Well what can I say, Iâ€™m amazing in every aspect with a long list of achievements to prove it. And Iâ€™m most definitely not single and alone, *definitely*. 

In all seriousness Iâ€™d appreciate the company to fill the subsuming vortex that corrodes the very fibre of my being. To distract me from the fact that entropy is unavoidable, that this universe embraces callous and casual destruction, that we are all just insolent, shouting beings clinging to a giant blue ball drifting through space, where we will someday arrive at our inevitable and cruel heat death.

Anyways, my dms are already lubed if anyone wants to slide in, your company would be deeply appreciated. (17M)
