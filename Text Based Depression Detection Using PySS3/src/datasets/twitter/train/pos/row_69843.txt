I've straight up been using Head &amp; Shoulders for body wash for years thinking it was a shampoo-body-wash blend. No wonder I get super raw and irritated every time I take a shower, how the fuck did I not stop and think, "I should use something different for body wash". I'm so disappointed in myself.
