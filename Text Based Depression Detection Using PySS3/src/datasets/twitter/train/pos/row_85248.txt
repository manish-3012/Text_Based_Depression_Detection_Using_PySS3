Iâ€™ve been dating my girlfriend for about 3 months, and I have a question. At what point on our relationship could I kiss her? The most we have done so far is just hug each other. Then again, the two times Iâ€™ve been over to her house has just about been her laying on top of me while we watch TV or something. So basically a constant hug, but should I kiss her sometime soon?
