I need help for my friend I need some advice because Iâ€™m taking my friend whoâ€™s in a not so good mental state out and treating her for the day. Basically all I have planned is to just buying her some candy and stuff and going for a walk and I need help knowing what I should do to brighten her day. I care about her a lot and wish for her to feel happier in general, so please give me some ideas.
