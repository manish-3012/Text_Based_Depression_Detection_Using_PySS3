Anyone wanna chat? DM me :)))) P. edulis is a perennial vine; tendrils are borne in leaf axils, and have a red or purple hue when young. There are two main varieties: a purple-fruited type, P. edulis f. edulis, and the yellow-fruited P. edulis f. flavicarpa.[3][4]

Usually the vine produces a single flower 5â€“7.5 cm wide at each node.[1][5] The flower has 5 oblong, green sepals and 5 white petals.[6] The sepals and petals are 4-6mm in length and form a fringe.[6] The base of the flower is a rich purple with 5 stamens, an ovary, and a branched style.[1] The styles bend backward and the anthers, which are located on top of the styles, have a very distinct head.[6]

The fruit produced is entirely fleshy (making it botanically a berry), and is spherical to ovoid.[3] The outside color of the berry ranges from dark-purple with fine white specks to light yellow.[1] The fruit is 4â€”7.5 cm in diameter; purple fruits are smaller, weighing around 35 grams, while yellow fruits are closer to 80 grams.[3] The smooth, leathery rind is 9â€“13 mm thick, including a thick layer of pith.[1][3] Within the berry, there are typically 250 black seeds, each 2.4 mm in length.[6] Each seed is surrounded by a membranous sac filled with pulpy juice.[1] The flavor of the juice is slightly acidic and musky.[1] The passion fruit's flavor can be compared to the guava fruit.[1]
