The sad thing about Wii music 1. I hate it being used so much
2. I bet the majority of teens now haven't ever heard it in the wild. E.g on an actual Wii

Man I fucking hate Wii music now. It was fun before but it has been so overused it's cringe now. I remember watching a video which I thought was fairly serious and then Wii music strats playing. Killed the whole mood.
