Does anybody else like being made fun of? When I do something dumb I feel it's 100x better for someone to joke about it and mock me than it is for them to be awkwardly quiet and try not to address it. I'm socially awkward so that makes it worse too. Nobody wants to bully a quiet person lol, but I thrive off of it tbh.
