What has actually happened I have no idea. So when I was in middle school I was extremely nervous while talking to people (mostly girls) but I figured out a girl actually liked me and I flipped out as I thought it was impossible. I was already nervous before but now I was really nervous. I was also in band with said girl and all of her friends where also in band. I acted extremely weird constantly and made a fool of myself. All the girls took it as me being a creep and they all sent me notes telling me how much of a creep I was when in reality I was just nervous. I was pretty screwed up for a solid 4-5 months after that but I got over it. Jump forward to high school and all the girls in my band had left (probably because of me) and I ended up being the 1st trombone because of that. Yeah... It's pretty weird and I'm still trying to piece together what happened
