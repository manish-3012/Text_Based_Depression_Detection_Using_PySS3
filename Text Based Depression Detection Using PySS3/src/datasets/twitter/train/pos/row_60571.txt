The Bible is immoral for condoning and encouraging slavery. To start off I totally understand that we are applying todayâ€™s moral standards to an ancient text. With that being said the Bible considers itself the â€œword of Godâ€. I understand there is a spectrum for Christianity and some believers donâ€™t think the Bible is inerrant or even the word of God. This post is directed at fundamentalists.

The Bible has so many passages that directly encourage and endorses slavery. Here are some of the most horrible and morally reprehensible verses that I know of (but there are dozens more).

â€œHowever, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.â€ (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)

Iâ€™m sorry but buying and selling humans like livestock is evil. An all knowing God should know better. We are more moral that this evil â€œGodâ€.

â€œIf you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, â€˜I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.â€™  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.â€ (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

Ah yes, slavey by keeping somebodyâ€™s family hostage. Sounds very John 3:16 of God here...

â€œWhen a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property.â€(Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)

Beating a slave is only ok if they survive the beating? Pure evil here. Again, we are more moral than this God.

â€œSlaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.â€ (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)

This little gem is for those of you that think it was only the Old Testament that was immoral and outdated. There are dozens of these â€œobey your masterâ€ verses. No you shouldnâ€™t obey your master, you shouldnâ€™t have a master in the first place.

â€œThe servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  â€œBut people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.â€ (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)

This one is for those of you that think it wasnâ€™t â€œGodâ€ making these evil commands...

To finish my argument. I think itâ€™s totally valid to apply todayâ€™s morals to a 2,000 year old text if Christians still use this book to morally bludgeon the rest of the world with. Maybe Christians should take some time to actually read the Bible before telling others how to behave. Considering their holy book literally allows and encourages slavery to continue. So much for being a holy and perfect book.
