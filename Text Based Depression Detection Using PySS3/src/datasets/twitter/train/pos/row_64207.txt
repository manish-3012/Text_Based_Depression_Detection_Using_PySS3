Sweet 16 Itâ€™s 12:35 am on Jan 22nd and I have super saddos cuz Iâ€™ve been planning on my 2 friends coming over for over a month, but now it seems like that ainâ€™t happening.

One friend canâ€™t come over because dad was skeptical of me going over to his house on Sunday, therefore spiraling out into him and mom getting in a 4 hour long argument, him taking my phone, going through al the texts between him and I, and also finding a special fucking toy I had to top it all off the next day. My dad says I canâ€™t talk to him anymore and I told him, so we agreed he would block me for a month until shit died down.

Now my other friend canâ€™t come over because sheâ€™s an hour away at the moment and her dadâ€™s a bit of a butt, even though my mom agreed to drive out to pick her up.

Long story short: another lonely birthday, go me
