I want to share a hillarious story So one day me and my friend were talking about something, i dont remember what we were talking about but i can remember that i was just listening while he was telling something. 1 meter behind him was a girl(she is the type of girl that would be offended by the smallest of things). After he was done talking he walked backwards for a short distance and turned around and bumped into the girl. I thought she was gonna yell at him for "touching her" or even "raping her" (she was known for saying shit like this). But she didnt say either of these things but starred at him for 2 seconds, punched him and yelled "ARE YOU GAY??". I couldnt stop laughing because he is now "gay" for touching a girl. You cant make this shit up!
