oh jesus, i just looked into my type of cancer and im so fucking lucky I have Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis on bone tissue, it occured twice. First in my left upper arm bone (idk what its called), then on my hip.

Basically it like weakens the bone i think and of course hurts a lot. When the first one in my arm occured we didnt think much of it and thought it was just a regular ache. We went to the doctor after it continued to hurt for 2 weeks, they did surgery on my arm and removed the bone tissue that was affected and replaced it.

Now because it weakens the bone, it becomes much easier to break said bone. Because we had it before when it happened a second time we got to the doctor almost 1 day later. To not let it occur again the doctors decided to use chemotherapy.

Here's the scary part. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis on bone tissue usually occurs on the skull (apparently) and because you cant operate on the skull that easily, they would have gone for chemotherapy again but until it fully healed it would still have a higher chance to break. And you can guess what that means. 

tldr: i got cancer on not as common but better places

I still did go through cancer tho, that wasnt fun (mainly the chemotherapy wasnt fun).
