Joyfriend is so damn cute Joyfriend being the term that people use when they're in a relationship with someone who identifies as nonbinary, or gender queer. 

I LOVE that term, "joyfriend" its so cute. Like introducing your partner to others as "hey this is my joyfriend" or talking about them like "oh my joyfriend did this last night-"

THATS SO CUTE, I love that sm.
