Reminder: Check up on your bros today Hi guys, I just wanted to post a reminder to check up on your bros (and grils) today. 

Boys and men are less likely to reach out to their fellow peers when theyâ€™re struggling with depression or other issues. Some of your friends may even be going through a rough patch that you donâ€™t know about, and theyâ€™re afraid to admit it. Itâ€™s important that we reach out to them instead and make sure theyâ€™re heard and cared for!

So go ahead and send a text to your bros, especially the ones who have been noticeably struggling today. It can mean the entire world to them :)
