Weâ€™re did the Redditors go Iâ€™m doing some assignment on the effects of social media on teens, and there was some chart on which media was used the most, and Reddit wasnâ€™t on the list. The Number 1 most used media is Facebook, FACEBOOK! The media of 40 year olds and minion memes, BEAT REDDIT! Then there was Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr, which is fair. But where did Reddit go?
