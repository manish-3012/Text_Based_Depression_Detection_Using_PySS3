The story about our teacher We had an amazing teacher - Andrey Urievich (We donâ€™t call teachers Mr. Smth in Russia, we use their first name and the middle name, Iâ€™ll call him AU for convenience). AU was an incredible math and algebra teacher, a strict one, but everyone loved him. He brought up and taught many generations. His methods were strict, but powerful. Once, a mom of one of the students came to him and said: â€œcould you please change 3 (or C) that my son got? 3 - is not our grade.â€ He said â€œno problemâ€ and changed it to 2 (or D). He was great. Until well...

An incident happened. It was summer holiday, and there was an annual trip to Georgia, â€œthe math summer campâ€. AU was the main guy and the responsible for everything that happened there. It was not obligatory, but many people were interested and went there every year. But this time it was different. For some reason, some girls had no drinking water. Wanting to drink, they approached the kitchen sink... and then it all went downhill. Due to bacteria in the water they were poisoned, and suffered a major damage for their immune system - even the flu could kill them. That was terrifying. My close friend was among them too. But it didnâ€™t stop there. Some people, mostly parents, started blaming AU for this - and they were partially right, because he was the one responsible. But the girls who suffered from this, and we, their classmates - we didnâ€™t blame him. It wasnâ€™t his fault. It was a misfortunate turn of events.

Unfortunately, AU got fired after that. Or, rather, he forcefully resigned. We have a good teacher now as well, but losing him... that was sad.
