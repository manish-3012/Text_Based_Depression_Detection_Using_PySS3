So I like someone I (M14) really like this girl, she makes me laugh and I make her laugh, we used to hang out every break time in school and walk to the bus stop together. The annoying thing is I never got her phone number, so Iâ€™ve had no way of talking to her. Schools back in a few weeks and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m in the same classes as her. Iâ€™m afraid if Iâ€™m not we wonâ€™t talk as much, I want to ask her out but not sure if weâ€™re at that stage yet. I know I should just ask but confessing your feelings is damn hard.
