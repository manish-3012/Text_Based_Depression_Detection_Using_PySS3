Teachers make or break the class Like idk if itâ€™s the same for you guys. There was this one teacher who chose students and basically showed favoritism towards them and I wasnâ€™t one of those students. Basically at the end of the year her favorites all received A+â€™s and the whole class ended up with Câ€™s. That was the first C ive ever gotten in my life. Iâ€™m generally an A and B student. Also I had to switch out of a class that gave college credit, cpr certification, and volunteer hours all because the teacher was a fucking bully. Iâ€™m still so mad about that.
