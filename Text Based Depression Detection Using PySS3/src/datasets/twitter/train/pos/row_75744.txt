I just realized 2020 is the year of toxicity After the pandemic started many people are showing theyâ€™re true colors and i met some people who are overly insensitive and fake  and here in the internet and i know some of u disagree with me calling a person sensitive and weak isnâ€™t funny what makes u even toxic that u donâ€™t effing care about peopleâ€™s feelings or u donâ€™t wanna be friends with âœ¨NON FAMOUS PEOPLEâœ¨ or u donâ€™t wanna get teased or bully by people whoâ€™s already wannabe cool kids for me I donâ€™t forgive bullies and even if ur a stranger but u bullied someone in ur school pr social media I wonâ€™t forgive u :) even u change or not but i wanna say shame on u and pls educate urself just to be nice and humble to people who care about u not making fun of him/her just to get attention and people will laugh at them for what u did to them i hope some of u guys will get karma and youâ€™ll understand what the society went toxic because of u and some toxic people and btw what triggers me is that some of the people around the world saying offensive jokes which isnâ€™t funny to me :) and mostly some 1st world countries had an bad attitude and uneducated and disgusting mind set what makes me even offended that youâ€™ll make fun with people like me as an asian girl i do 
get bullied here in the internet like come on really cause of my serious attitude did u even know how hard being sexual or getting teased so badly... and yes this is why I donâ€™t have friends cause of ur filthy mindset and u donâ€™t care :) so this upcoming i hope everyone will understand what makes the world even worse now.
