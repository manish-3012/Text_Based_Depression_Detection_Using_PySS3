I have a crush... Guys Idk what to do!!!!! I have a crush on this guy in my class, he's super cute, he's a little quiet and shy but he's definitely my type! But my bet friend likes him.. even tho typically she's attracted to.. well hillbilly's. He is not a hillbilly by any means. I haven't had the courage to talk to him, and I don't want my friend to get mad at me. Idk how to talk to him!



There's also another guy, I've liked for like two years but I feel like I don't have a shot with him, cuz he's definitely more country, and popular. Idk ðŸ˜. My friend also liked him and he's always talking to her, they're friends, and she keeps telling me things like "he's told me alot of stuff, but I can't tell you" even though I'm her best friend. Typically I'm the more empathic person, but people ignore me and judge me, and they like her. 


Then there's a girl. She had a crush on me before I came out to myself. Soooo I freaked out. People say she still likes me, and I kinda like her to! We used to be friends but she stopped hanging out with us cuz my friend doesn't really like LGBTQ people. She kinda runs away whenever I'm near her or tries to talk to her, and she gets embarrassed easily but idk how to talk to her either!
