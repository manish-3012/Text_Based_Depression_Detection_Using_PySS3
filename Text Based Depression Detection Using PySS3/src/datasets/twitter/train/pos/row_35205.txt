How do I convince my parents to let me choose when I go to bed? So this may sound stupid (and it is, at least from my perspective) but my parents are strict and treat me like Iâ€™m 8 even though Iâ€™m 14. They say I have to go to bed at a certain time on weekdays, and all my friends are still up at 11 pm on school nights, talking about â€œwho wants to vc on discordâ€ and shit like that. Whatâ€™s a way that I can tell my parents I donâ€™t give a flying fuck about how much sleep I get, and that I can stay up as late as I want (this sounds extremely childish but itâ€™s my parents fault for putting these dumbass rules in place)
