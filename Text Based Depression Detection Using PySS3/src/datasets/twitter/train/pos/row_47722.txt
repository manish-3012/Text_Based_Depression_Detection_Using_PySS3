Wyd if shit with your crush is going too fast? I mean it's pretty clear that we both like each other but we've been talking extensively wayy too little, besides we still haven't met irl but have mutual friends. However she is already sending heart emojis and compliments and its melting my heart but I'm not ready for it to go so fast quite yet.
