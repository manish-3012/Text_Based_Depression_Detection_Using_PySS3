I passed my AutoCAD certification!!! I'm so happy, it was honestly so stressful that even after I found out I passed I still wanted to puke because of the residual stress.  That's all though.  Have a good day everyone! Just wanted to announce that 
P.S. my best friend just got his first girlfriend so if y'all could wish him congrats via this post, just comment, anyways sorry for the long post, thanks for reading and have a great day!
