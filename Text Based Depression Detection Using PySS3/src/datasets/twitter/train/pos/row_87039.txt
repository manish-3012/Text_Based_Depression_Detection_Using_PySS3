I need some help This is a long story and idk how to explain it. So basically my friend(f14)  made a groupchat on ig and there was this guy ive never spoken to before. He dmed me and we started talking. at first everything seemed normal he was a chill guy but then he asked me to send him thigh pics at first i thought he was joking and brushed it off. After that everything went normal but then i stopped texting i ghosted him for 3 days and after that my friend who added him to the groupchat said that i should block him. so apperantly he was threatning my friend that he would share her thigh pics if she didnt send nudes. U might be wondering how he got thight pics, well she didnt send any he just had a pic of her in an outfit that showed her thights so my friend just blocked the guy and reported him i did too.

So today my sister walkes up to me and says that some random dude has been texting her and hes claming that my friend send him nudes which is a lie hes now texting other ppl that idk what elses hes going to do. My friend is really worried i blocked both of his acs and made my sister and my friend to post on thayr storys to block that guy idk what else i can do abt this so im asking for help. 


P.S sry for the spelling im trying to be as fast as possible so he doesnt do anything worse
