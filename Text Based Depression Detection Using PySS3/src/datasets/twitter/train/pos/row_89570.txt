Boys ( and girls ig), I just had my first kiss!!     Okay, so Iâ€™m at my friends house rn, and my gf is best friends with my friends sister so she was here too. It was like 3 in the morning and our friends were asleep, so it was just me and my gf on the couch together. I turned on a movie because I got bored, and we watched it together for about twenty minutes. Then, out of nowhere, she sat up, crawled on top of me, and we started making out. Keep in mind, we had only been dating two months, and I had never kissed anyone before. We kept going for about twenty minutes till she pulled away. We did that ten more times that night. HOLY SHIT WTF JUST HAPPENED!!!! My adrenaline is pumping like crazy!!
