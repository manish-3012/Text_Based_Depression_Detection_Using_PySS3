Did breaking bad change me, I'm really serious I really find myself a lot in Walter and i would be up to do sacrifices but I'm scared a bit now because i question myself and i don't want to do shit in my life. With the years I've gotten to a lvl where i don't care about anymore i guess acne and how i got humiliated is what makes me to find myself in this character.  I just wish i had the life I've never had. I feel lowkey desensitized but at the same time if you know how  to "hit" me you got trough me
