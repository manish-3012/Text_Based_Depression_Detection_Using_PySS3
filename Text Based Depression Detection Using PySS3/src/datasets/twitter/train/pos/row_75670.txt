I canâ€˜t take this shit anymore Like wtf covid is hitting hard here where i live, i suck at everything i do, school is stressing me out and i donâ€™t understand in general why i keep getting up everyday. I donâ€™t get any sleep, itâ€™s so fucking cold in school that im catching one cold after another and the sun is gone because of winter. I honestly donâ€™t know how i am supposed to survive this year. I canâ€™t speak to people due to social anxiety and the few friends i have donâ€˜t really care about me.
