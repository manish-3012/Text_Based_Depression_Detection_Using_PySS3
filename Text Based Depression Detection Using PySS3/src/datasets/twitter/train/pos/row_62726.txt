why the duck does my crush always have to be there for the most embarrassing things fr yesterday i was walking up to a closed door and he opened it for me and as i awkwardly said thanks i TRIPPED over his foot and fell into his arm. the same thing happened once last year as well. and also when i was like a cringy 11 year old i had a fan account and today i decided to open it for the first time in 3 years and he follows me and i follow him back. i didnâ€™t even know who tf he was when i last used that fan account at 12 and the stuff on there is CRINGY. what if he knows it used to be my account. idk how tf we even followed each other either

and honestly thatâ€™s not even it. thereâ€™s just so much more but like whyyyy ?
