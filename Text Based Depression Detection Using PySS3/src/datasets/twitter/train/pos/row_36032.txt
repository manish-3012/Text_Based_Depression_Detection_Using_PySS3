I donâ€™t know how to even title this I think in going through sone kind of crisis. Im 16, i only have 2 years left until im an adult and life as i know it changes permanently. Its only 2 years until i lose contact with most of my friends, and only 2 years of just my normal day to day stuff. I am literally losing tens of hours of sleep per week over this for the past few months and i just donâ€™t know why its bothering me so much. I donâ€™t know whats going on, i just dont want to lose what i have i guess
