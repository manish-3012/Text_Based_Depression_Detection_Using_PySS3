Does anyone feel like the world is broken and no one is trying to fix it? Whenever I look at the news, I feel real upset. There's so much suffering in the world. Things are on fire, people are dying, everything is terrible. What's worse, is that there's this whole election thing going on, yet not of the problems plaguing our society are being fixed! I get so upset every time I hear about what's going on in the world. It's like nobody cares when the world is a mess. Come on, these problems might be hard to fix. It's going to take sacrifice from everyone to try to fix the mess of society that we have right now. But people are so unwilling to give up a little bit so the world can improve a lot. It's depressing to think about how unbelievably selfish the average person is.
