Im done with my teacher! (Rant) Last year i was in photography, with this teacher who im gonna call S, this year im in technology/ computer class with S. You think that in photography we would photograph things, but NO we had to fricken write a newspaper and same thing in tech class! Im done with S and im pretty sure the school doesn't give her that to teach. She makes up stupid reasons why we write news papers when i know PLENTY of people who would join a newspaper team! I would be fine with it if it was an English class but nooo it had to be classes that were completely different from that. And that teacher is the whole reason i play cello again cause i hated that class so much. Damn. Okay im done ranting, thanks for reading if you did.
