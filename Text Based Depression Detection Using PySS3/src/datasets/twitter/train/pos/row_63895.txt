I'm embarrassed... Last year, when I was in 8th grade, I made "free nut pass(es)" for the boys in my class. I remember making them as a joke with my friends but then seconds later, my guy friend is asking for one. He went to his friends and showed them the piece of paper. Minutes later, they're all asking for one. I am so embarrassed... (I'm a girl btw so uh ok)
