The boomers might be right... So my friend and I were sitting in art class and somebody left their school picture forms on the desk, and we were looking at them and he was making fun of the little kids on the front for some reason. At some point he pointed to a really small picture of a girl and he was like, â€œomg look at this one itâ€™s ugly!â€ (Lmfao what), but he DEADASS tried to DOUBLE TAP THE PICTURE AND DRAG IT OUT TO ZOOM IN ON IT AND I WAS LITERALLY DYING

I wish I had gotten a video of it bc Iâ€™m so mad I donâ€™t have proof
