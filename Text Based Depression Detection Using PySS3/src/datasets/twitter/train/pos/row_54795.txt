Can you please stop using our identities as an excuse to everything? So it all started from the problems with Kristen Gray, particularly in Bali. So she came to Indonesia, and her visa is expired (she used a visa that only allows her to stay, but not work or make money). As she makes money, by selling books that encourage other tourists to take advantage of Bali's low cost of living, she should pay taxes according to Indonesia's law, but she did not. And also, telling other tourists to find a "sanctuary" in Bali while the entire Indonesia is suffering from COVID-19 problems.

Of course, the locals didn't like this and wanted her out.

Now when she gets a backlash, she claims that Indonesia is a homophobic racist country for not liking her. The truth is, we don't care if she's white or black or brown or blue or green or whatever, she cheated the system and it's illegal. Heck, even more black americans supported her and started calling us dog-eaters, and having restaurants that serve dogs as food. (Who's the racist one now?)

My point is, I'm fine with you being queer, trans, lesbian, black, or anything, but just don't use it as an excuse for anything.

Like for example, if you are a trans person, and you punched someone, don't call them transphobic when they punch you back.

Like when you're gay and you yell at someone, dont call them homophobic when they tell you to stop screaming at them.

When you're a black person who dislikes anime but i like anime you call me a racist trump supporter or something.

TL;DR: You don't get extra priveliges nor always being right just because you are a minority.
