Posting everyday until I get a girlfriend. Day: 69 Nice.


Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ve failed yâ€™all. I wasnâ€™t able to get a GF today. 

But back to seriousness: Iâ€™m so scared that Iâ€™ll never love someone again. Be as happy with someone as I was with her. Iâ€™m scared that the thought of her will always keep me from being genuinely happy with someone else.
