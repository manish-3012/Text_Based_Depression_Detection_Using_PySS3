I once again shall talk about my life So past few years Iâ€™ve been a tad bit depressed. I felt even worse during quarantine due to life and social problems. Well anyway I used to know this girl and her brother, usually saw them every summer but around my freshmen year at high school I stopped seeing her. She lives out of town so the only reason I see her is because a relative of hers lives next door. Today I finally went over to see her. Now Iâ€™m gonna be real I used have the feels for her when I was a young lad but now idk. Now Iâ€™m going to be honest Iâ€™m going to ask for her and her brotherâ€™s numbers tomorrow now that we have phones lol so atleast I can keep in contact. Iâ€™m not asking for advice or anything but I just feel kinda happy for once after all these years. Knowing me I probably got deep feelings for her I have yet to discover but itâ€™s nice seeing childhood friends tho. Been so long she practically looks older than me came out to see her with make up which probably shocked me and my mom lol. Iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s only being in town for another 2 days so hopefully I can feel happy or atleast decent for a week.
