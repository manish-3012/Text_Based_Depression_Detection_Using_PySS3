What does this mean The other day i was playing basketball with some friends and my crush was there. I was wearing a christmas hat and we were joking about me being santa, all of a sudden my crush says " damn, why is santa here and why is he built like a dor frame" idk i took that as a compliment bc i am VERY skinny. Idk can someone tell me if that is a compliment or a roast.
