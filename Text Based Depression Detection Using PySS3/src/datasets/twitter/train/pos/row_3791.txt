I need to vent Last year, I was thirteen, coming out of depression that almost killed me, my mom was being a lot nicer than usual, my dad had just been 5 months sober (opiates) . Everything had been going good.

2 months later, I had found out my dad had relapsed.
My mom had a new boyfriend who is mentally abusive, to me and my brother, my mom would not see anything wrong.
But I had made new friends and started hanging out with them, a new for me. Not all bad.

Jump cut 6-ish months, its lockdown, My mom's boyfriend, justin, had moved in, and brought in one of his kids, forcing me out of my nice, warm, and cozy room, To an unfinished, moldy, cold basement room, I've never been closer to suicide.

Last month, Justin's other kid moved in, they're moving her into the basement too, building her a room infact, refusing to even acknowledge that I'm living in squalor,

I'm so fucking tired, tired of being passed over, forgotten, ignored, bullied BY FUCKING ADULTS, I have no one to share my emotions to, it's so fucking lonely.
