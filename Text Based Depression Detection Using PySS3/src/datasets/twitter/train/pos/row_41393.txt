So Iâ€™ve been trying to learn Japanese... ...and a while back I decided to use duolingo. I went on every once and a while and did shit cuz I did them in month increments. Then they offered me this one offer. Use it for 7 days and weâ€™ll double the XP. The XP meant nothing to me but I took the challenge anyways and guess what? Iâ€™m actually effectively learning Japanese.
