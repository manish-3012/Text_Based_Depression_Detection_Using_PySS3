The youngest arenâ€™t always the favorite I am the youngest in the family, the stereotype of the youngest in the family is always the favorite is wrong, Iâ€™m constantly being picked and always being yelled at, I was given dinner and a $7 dollar record on my birthday, my brothers getting over $200 worth of stuff for his birthday, I get yelled at for being in my room too long, my brother only comes out of his room for food and bathroom, if I complain about my brother or sister being mean I get yelled at and told â€œjust to ignore themâ€ but when my brother says something mean about me my parent laugh at say â€œstop while laughingâ€. My brother pushed me for walking too slow and I almost hit my mon, I was yelled at and told to walked faster or Iâ€™m grounded
