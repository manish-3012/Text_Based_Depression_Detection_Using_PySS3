I posted a song everyday becuase why not, for 139 days. Thanks to everyone who followed along the way as I created a playlist for all of you right here in the r/teenagers subreddit. Songs were posted daily here since October and added to a playlist over on Spotify. I added songs from my personal library, daily discoveries and your suggestions. I have made my favourite playlist with a story.

I have decided to end the daily songs. It has no longer become a fun goal to do every day and become a chore before I go to bed. I am finding it harder to find daily music that deserves my playlist. I will be leaving the playlist in itâ€™s current state but have one song to add today. 

This is my goodbye for now. Thanks to everyone that came along the way I wish you all the best.
