Do you want to know something that bugs me? I don't feel all too loved with my father, it's the fact that he doesn't try. Never tries to go out with us to get something to eat, I always have to text him first and then, he wouldn't even try to get into stuff I enjoy. This is the prime example;

So, I have about 12 teddies that I hold dear to my heart, right? They're like my first loves, (oh god, that sounded awful) they're good because they have helped me through 2020 and simply put. I really care about them. Just bare with me, if you can't comprehend what I'm feeling, imagine this is your pet or girlfriend (That's worst). Anyway he doesn't want much to do with them. I know I sound bloody crazy so the next thing is that when it comes to playing games, he never asks me, I always have to ask him. (on phone btw, living with me mum and my dad living by himself) I have to ask to spend time with me, he's also very easily beaten. So, he's not trying there.

One time, I told my dad, "Sometimes I feel that you love yourself more then you love me."  
He said, "I do."
