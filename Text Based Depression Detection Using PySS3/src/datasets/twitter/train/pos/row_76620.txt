Why canâ€™t people on Facebook market place look at the description ðŸ˜’ Like 3 people already have asked my what size is the jacket Iâ€™m selling and Iâ€™m like bruh, itâ€™s in the description. (I didnâ€™t actually reply with that, Iâ€™m not that big of an asshole). Iâ€™m just wondering why donâ€™t people read the description when buying things.
