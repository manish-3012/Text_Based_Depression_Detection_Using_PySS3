Ideas. But it's not what you'd think!  Hey, I'm a Dm and I had a group of noobs to Dm for. So I made them their own little country where they could learn the rules of the game. We had so much fun that we couldn't abandon our land so I tried my best to expand the world, creating the rest of the world, the underworld, dungeons, underwater civilization, cloud kingdoms, etc... I've been running out of ideas and the players are still wanting more content. What I really need are some suggestions for quests and side quests. Adventures. Curses, Characters, Kingdoms, Items, anything that could help me out. And it doesn't have to be original either. Per example, I recently adapted the Fiery Grog Tavern and the Rat King and placed it into the story and the world. Any ideas will help me and surely anyone else who happens to stumble on this post. So please, anything you can think of or that you know of could help!
