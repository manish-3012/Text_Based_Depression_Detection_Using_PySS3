Something people might need to hear. Hey you! Yes, YOU! If you genuinely like something, go do it. Finding something you care about and enjoy is kinda rare, so OBSESS! There are far more harmful things in life than caring about something. It does not matter what that thing is, whether it is weird, nerdy, cringey, etc. Start a fan account! Talk about it with random people! Scream really loud! Being passionate about stuff is a good thing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
