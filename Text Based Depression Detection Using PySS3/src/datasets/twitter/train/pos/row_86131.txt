Come on, just make fun of me for caring about this! I'm not trying to look cool by being depressed, I'm just sick of this bullshit!
There are people much much worse then me, and the amount of love that they receive is much much more then the amount of love that I get... I just can't understand it... just why?!
Yeah I know I'm not perfect at all but nobody is perfect, right? So what is the deal? Am I don't deserve to be loved? Is that it?

Ugh... I'm FUCKIN SICK OF IT!
