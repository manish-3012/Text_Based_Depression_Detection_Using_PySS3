Does anyone else just never speak to their parents &amp; have nothing in common with them? (18 M) First off, let me just apologize cuz Iâ€™m about to rant hard. This has been on my mind so much lately and Iâ€™ve really been stressing about it. Ok, so I just recently turned 18. Iâ€™ve always been kind of a bad kid, because I was overprotected my entire life. As a kid I was never allowed to play M-rated games, listen to explicit music (I did anyways), and never watched an R-rated movie with parents until a couple months ago. I hide everything from my parents. They donâ€™t know what music I listen to. (If they found out, theyâ€™d hate it because all they listen to is classic rock and Christian music.) They donâ€™t know my real personality at all because Iâ€™m wearing this fake mask whenever Iâ€™m with them. Now, a lot of my friends parents... Iâ€™m SO FUCKING JEALOUS. Iâ€™ll go over there, my friends can just swear around their parents like normal people. My mom yelled at me the other day for jokingly calling my friend a â€œbitchâ€ and I havenâ€™t sworn in front of her since. All these people have been allowed to have M games and R movies theyâ€™re whole life. Shit, some of my friendâ€™s parents let them smoke weed at their house. My parents on the other hand (probably) still think weed kills people, even though they drink alcohol every weekend. Every time I come home from work it goes like: â€œheyâ€ how was work â€œgoodâ€ and thatâ€™s it. I go straight to my room and spend the rest of the night on the internet. Now I love my parents to death for sure. Theyâ€™ve provided me everything. And Iâ€™m not complaining, I love my life. I just donâ€™t understand and I feel like Iâ€™m the only one with parents THIS strict. And it makes me sad that I canâ€™t have fun with my parents simply because of how strict they are.
