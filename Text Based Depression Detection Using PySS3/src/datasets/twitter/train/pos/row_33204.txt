Am I in a bad position for colleges? Here are my extracurriculars (I'm in 10th grade, and have a 4.0 GPA so far for this year):

-Started a youth activist org over the summer with two friends from school. We planned protests and were on television a few times, but things have been slowing down lately due to bad air quality in my area and of course school.
-We are trying to start a youth activist club at our school but I'm worried that people won't join since we'll be online
-Girls Inc
-Black Student Union - our pres graduated so I'll run for pres or vice pres this year, am working on bringing our club back online
-National Honor Society, am now a club member
-Track, was doing xc but have Student Gov in the same time slot sooo it's kinda like "bruh"
-NAACP, am one of the original members in my city since it started over the summer
-Mayor is starting a Youth Advisory Council for us
-Will be helping prep an Ethnic Studies program at local high schools and colleges
-Friend started a "Love from Heart" team to help cancer patients. I am our Social Reporter (i.e. I write emails to different hospitals requesting donations.) I want to do more tho
