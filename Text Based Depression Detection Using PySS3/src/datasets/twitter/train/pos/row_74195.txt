I just don't know what to do One of my online friends killed himself, he was really the only one i kept in major contact with and i don't have friends IRL so i was really close to him i just don't know what to do ive never lost someone that i have a strong connection with i just wish he had messaged me instead i wish i had messaged him that night. It all feels so preventable but i wasn't there to prevent it.
