No matter how good something becomes, or bad it eventually becomes, what was never seems as good as what is This applies to nearly every single thing. But for us sad teenagers, it applies so much to friendships and relationships. 

Even if the relationship doesnt end up breaking apart and actually keeps going and getting better, if you have old texts, or other memories, you almost certainly could look back at them and miss what was. 

Something as simple as conversations you used to have but dont anymore, ways you used to talk or text them, and maybe now things are even just *slightly* different, and so much more.

Its as simple as things change with time. And it really is usually not fun at all.

Thats all. Thanks for coming to the ted talk.
