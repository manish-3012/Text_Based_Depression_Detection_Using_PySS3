Talking about random stuff: Day 92 Man, it's been little over a year since a joined Reddit.

Sadly, the first thing I did on Reddit was join r/PewdiepieSubmissions. As many of you know, it's just full of stupid circlejerks and reposts. I left it a while ago, and I glad I did.

Felix himself is not a bad guy, he's rational and self-aware. But his fanbase is fucking annoying, especially his subreddit. For example,   there was this stupid Twitter drama over his Spotify playlist, and some artist tweeted that he didn't want Pewdiepie to listen to his music. It was a shitty thing to say, but Felix blurred his name and said he didn't want anyone to go after him. 

I'm not on Twitter, but in the youtube comments, people were asking for his name and going after him, contrary to what Felix wanted. 

Well, half of the subreddit are actual nine-year olds, so I can understand all the circlejerking. Little kids do what they see, what they think is cool, and you can't blame really blame them.
