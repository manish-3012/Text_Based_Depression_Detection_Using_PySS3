I wrote a poem! We just started our poetry unit in my creative writing class, and I love how this one came out and wanted to share!

â€œCrushâ€

Her beauty is the Earth

So wonderful to behold

Yet so vast that my timeÂ 

Is too short to see it all



I watch her walk by

Like a dog watching youÂ 

Carry food away

Admiring



She looks at me

And all the thoughtsÂ 

In my head

Walk away and leave me alone



From here I can smell her perfume

From here I can hear her dangly earrings clinging together with the 
turn of her head

I can feel the blush in my cheeks growing darker, until my face is as red as her tall, tall heels

I see her beauty and I am in love, falling, and falling swiftly



She doesnâ€™t notice my stare

And walks away

I will never see her again

I do not know her name
