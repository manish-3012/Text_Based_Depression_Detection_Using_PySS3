Boys playing lots of minecraft again for lime 2-3 years finally pays off Guys at my school are hosting a server with like uhc's, minigames, and probably like bed wars and sky wars, and probably are gonna have some kind of tournaments, and even tho I'm ok/decent on hypixel, when I was playing on most polish servers it was like comparing playing football/soccer against Real Madrid, and then transitioning to playing against some random club u-15 club from the USA
