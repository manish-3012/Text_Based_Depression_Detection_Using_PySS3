I need help with my science fair project I need to pick a topic for my science fair project by tomorrow. My assigned group are literal sloths that won't do anything, so I'm completely alone in this. Plus, I'm the group leader so my teacher's gonna get mad at me if we don't have a topic by tomorrow.

I need something that's easy, with a low cost, but can also be related to all three science subjects (bio, chem, and physics).

Please save me from getting in trouble.

I'm in 10th grade btw so plz give me some ideas appropriate to my grade level.
