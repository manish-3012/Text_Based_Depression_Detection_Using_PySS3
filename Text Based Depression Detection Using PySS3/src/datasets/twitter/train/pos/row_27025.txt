Lazer-focused while in irl school environment, but unable to pay attention on zoom/at home Has anyone else felt the same way? 

I was a near-perfect student with a 3.9something unweighted GPA w/APs in irl school, perfect attendance, whatever, but now I am cramming months of assignments into days right before itâ€™s due with adderall-induced allnighters

I hope that this is just me, cause fuck, my sleep schedule would make most parents of newborns jealous

Itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve gotten some type of seasonal affective disorder/clinical depression based solely on the fact that school is online
