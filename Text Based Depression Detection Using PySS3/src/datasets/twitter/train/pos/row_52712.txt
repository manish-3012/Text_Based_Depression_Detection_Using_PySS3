my mom (almost certainly) has bpd, and want to move to dad's house over the past 2 years my mom's mental state has been declining. she verbally abuses me and herself and makes me feel guilty for why she feels this way. i can't take her shit anymore. these things have been going on for 5 years now. i'm trying to move to my dad's house, and moving won't be a problem. i have a small drawer full of stuff, some videogames, a tv, and clothes that will all fit in his sedan. but how will i break the news to my mom? will she go full psycho on me and bar me from leaving? i'm thinking i should sneak out and go to my dads when she's asleep. but i have no clue how this would go. my brother is supporting me 100%, as he said it. i am almost absolutely sure i want to leave, but i'm prone to think that she will go into a depression, manic state, or even commit suicide. i don't know what the right thing to do is. would it be morally right to leave someone, even if it would destroy them, if it was for an important cause, to save one's own life from tyranny? or would i just be a dickhead risking my mother's own life, just to make mine easier? when people say words hurt harder than injury, i would know. i grew up being injured almost always, and i would recover merely 20 minutes later. with words, they affect me, but in 20 minutes i am alright again. this applies to my situation, but the mental pain is adding up, and soon i won't be able to take it anymore. i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a long time, and now im at about a 30% chance of killing myself, because my only options are painful. less painful ways, like a gun, raise my chances up to about 50.
