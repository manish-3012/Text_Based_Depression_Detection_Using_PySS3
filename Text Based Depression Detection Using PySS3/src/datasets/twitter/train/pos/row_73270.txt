Just want to be given some more responsibility around time management, how can I convince my dad to give that to me? My dad has a 1-1.5 hour time limit on my pc and I bought it with my money earned entirely through guitar performances (busking). He is well versed in tech and overall a good parent but the last time I bypassed the limit (which was just after i moved to pc after years of work, making me quite eager to play with my long waiting friends) i spent 7 hours on Valorant trying to make up for what felt like lost time. He promptly took my admin permissions on MY pc so I cant even change to daylight savings time without a password, and said if I ever exploit the limit again he would sell it on eBay for any price and give me the money, but not let me get any gaming hardware again.
