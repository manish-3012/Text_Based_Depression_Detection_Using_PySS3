Finally started taking my meds again This is a little thing, but ever since school got cancelled because of covid(mid march) I haven't taken my ADHD meds once, and have been paying the price. I have been so disorganized, ditsy for the past 5 months. Well that ends now, as I start back on a tight schedule, and start taking my meds again!
