I dont know what to name this but I need help I found this subreddit because I need somewhere to find help with teenage drama.. So I recently slept over at my friends house and left a small bracelet there. It may be small but it means the world to me because it was a symbol of my friendship with someone who was my only friend for about 5 years. I texted her about it and she's getting all mad at me because I'm bugging her but I'm literally crying and she doesn't even care. Me and my best friend both think she took it but she'll get mad at me if I tell her, what should i do?
