Should I confess to the girl I like - update 1 In my last post I asked if I should tell the girl I like that I like her, and all the answers were that I should. She lives in a different city (about 1h15m of cycling away) so its hard to meet her but we've made plans to meet in about 1.5 weeks, she thinks its just to hang out and talk, and she has no clue (I think). The biggest fear I had about it is that I don't dare to do it when I'm there, so I wrote it in a lettter (took me three tries and about two hours) which I'm planning to give her or leave somewhere she'll find it. I promised I would give y'all an update so here you go. I'll give another update once I did it.
