theres this girl i havent talked to in 3 weeks, should i check up on her? for context, idek know if we re friends at this point. she always makes excuses to why she never texts first, or why she takes 1943583535368 hours to respond to something. at this point i think she might be lying tbh. the last message i sent to her was "wanna watch that movie on halloween also why u sleep so much lol" and she left me read. now the reason i wanna check up on her is that she has been really quiet on social media. for those 3 weeks. she doesnt really post anything at all, i just wanna know if she is doing alright. however, idk if she even deserves it cuz i always give her attention but she doesnt seem to care
