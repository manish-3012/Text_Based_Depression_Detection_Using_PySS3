That time I was "choked" There was this time probably when I was around 9 or 10 I guess I did something bad or whatever. And my Dad was extremely pissed at me for whatever reason and pinned me on the bed with his hands around my neck while screaming 2 inches away from my face. At the time I could barely breathe probably from insane panic. I've had my share of physical punishment from spanking to being kicked in the leg by my cousin, to being forced to eat dish soap by my other mentally unstable cousin to being punched in the head to being bitchslapped in the face. I didn't bring this up until about 2-4 years later to my school as probably revenge for being lied to about my suspicions of drug abuse that turned out to be true, I found that out myself and no one admits a single wrongdoing. DCS got involved with the choking thing and my sister said she saw the whole fight. No charges ever came up and the whole thing was forgotten about. Me and my Dad did have a sort-of abusive relationship, but eventually straightened it out, which He only got to see about a year of until he passed. I don't get into physical fights anymore but I do still have serious issues.
