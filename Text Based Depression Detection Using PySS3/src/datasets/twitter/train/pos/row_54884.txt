As we are approaching the six-month anniversary of my best friend's death, I have been granted a near total relapse of grief, along with a constant headache and dizziness for the past two days, but no one believes me since it happened 'so long ago', so I should apparently be over it. This is why I had a deeper connection with him than anyone else I ever knew.
