Why do teachers think that school is all it matters when we are in a middle of a pandemic that is fucking with every person alive and dead Just why. Instead of relaxing and staying safe I have to stress 24/7 and do hw until I die and then they still force me to show up in that hell at 8 am every morning (excluding Saturday and Sunday which they also ruin with hella tons of work)
