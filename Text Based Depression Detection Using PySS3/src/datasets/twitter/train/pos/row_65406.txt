What states have you been to? Hereâ€™s mine in order:

Massachusetts (2003)

New Hampshire (2005)

Maine (2005)

Vermont (2008)

Rhode Island (2010)

North Carolina (2015)

Illinois (2016)

Utah (2016)

Colorado (2019)

Connecticut (2019)

New York (2019)

New Jersey (2020)

I got 12/50 but if weâ€™re only counting the states I stayed in than take out Illinois and New Jersey.

The dates I listed for the New England states besides Massachusetts are all the absolute latest I would have gone to them. Like for example I doubt that the first time I went to Connecticut was when I was almost 16 I just donâ€™t remember going there before then. Everything else I definitely have right.
