Posting something I am greatful for for 7 days day 2 I  greatful for the things I have that help me live, the food I have, the clothes I have, The shelter I have, the water I have and, the fresh air I have. Most of the time people (and myself included) overlook these things most of the time. It is very important to focus on things like these that support you in some way.
