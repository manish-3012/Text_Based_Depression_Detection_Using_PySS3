I have no idea how, but a slipper of mine fixed itself Yesterday I was walking around in my favourite slippers. I tripped and tore a hole in one (they're croched so the stiches were visibly torn). I remember thinking about sewing them back when I got to sleep, but when I woke up the tear was never there. They weren't stiched back, they looked like it never happened. No one was in my room when I was sleeping and my dad came to wake me up when I was already awake.

I don't have an explanation for this. I know for a fact that tearing them wasn't a dream because I remember it and I even felt the cold after and so on... so what happened?
