I'm worried you know the person from the post of the dog who died? on the post she said "mommy will be there soon" (or something like that) and that made a lot of people worried.
she also posted something on r/suicidewatch saying that she might kill herself.
I sent a message to her but she didn't answered, and she didn't posted or replied to something in almost a day. 
I'm worried about her and if anyone knows about anything please tell me.
