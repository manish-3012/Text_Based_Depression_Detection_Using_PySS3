Hello everyone, I have come to the conclusion that maybe, just maybe, 2020 aint that bad &amp;#x200B;

Except for (almost) world war 3, forestfires in australia, a worldwide pandemic, protests about racial injustice, people taking advantage of the protests, a massive drop in world economy, a halt to everything normal happening in the world due to someone eating a bat, the death of a basketball legend, an explosion in lebanon, and Trump fucking up multiple times along the year(gotta thank the blessed meme format we got along though), the year has been fine.

&amp;#x200B;

(there was a ship wreck also, couple hundred metres from the coast of my country, and nothing was done bout by our government until 2 days later, when thousand of tons of oil was getting spilled in the sea, causing irreversible damage, and being the cause of the death of 10 dolphins couple weeks later. The shit was WAAAY off the allowed zone of our little island, and coast guards, etc, just didnt intervene about the ship. it was the general public that forced the government into acting against the unfortunate event\[which could have been avoided, if it wasnt for the prime minister's negligence\])
