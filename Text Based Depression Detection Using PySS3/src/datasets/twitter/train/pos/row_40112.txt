Help needed! So, I've been at my girl's place for the first time ever, so new everything. Usually i have a great visual memory and space awareness so learning new surroundings isn't hard for me. Long story short my girlfriend is claiming that we have been on a walk during the time period of 12:15 - 13:15, and she continues to tell me all the details that I was on a swing so on (consider that this happens today while we where walking through that area where I've been supposedly been already, but i felt like I see it for the first time). It's driving me crazy that I forgot an hour or so of the day that happend 2 days ago. My solution was that if I can see my GPS history tracking in last 2 days so I can see if she's right or I'm getting  alzheimer's. Any other suggestions are welcome!
