Celebrate Day 1 (81) 2021, 1/365. 

We have stepped in. We have stepped into the **GREATEST** year of our lives. 2020 was for constant lessons and evolving. 2021 is for constant lessons and miracles. Hold **Faith &amp; Trust.**

I hope you wrote things down that you want to accomplish; "goals", "resolutions", if you have been waiting to start them when the New Year flipped over, **WELL,** here we are. **GET TO IT.**

There are no more excuses. We have all been shown how life can change very quickly, how we must focus on what we love to do &amp; who we want to surround ourselves with, day to day. This year is the year to focus on that business, focus on painting, focus on music, focus on writing that book, focus on your identity, sexuality, meditation, healing, focusing on whatever it is that **YOU** are passionate about**.** Our lives are all so precious and what should be realized is perspective; how precious every morning that we are allowed to wake up is a blessing, every moment we are allowed to breathe and be one with God/Mother Earth is a blessing.

Try. Taste. Realize its not for you, then go and try something else. There are 1000's and 1000's of different areas to improve upon, from creative to personal self, to entrepreneurship, to self awareness, empathy &amp; compassion. It is truly beautiful how abundant this world is, how there is truly a limitless source of opportunities, blessings, miracles and healing for **ALL** of us; the only thing is though, **YOU** have to go and search for it. I am still searching daily, searching for a moment of presence, searching for healing, searching for my true self, I know it will all come to me, with day to day practice.

**WE HAVE WALKED INTO THE GREATEST YEAR OF OUR LIVES.** Start right now. Get to it.

**I love you.**
