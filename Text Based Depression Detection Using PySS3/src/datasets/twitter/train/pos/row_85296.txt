Why we NEED to be able to change usernames: MY CASE My brother (who's either 7 or 9 or 11 I can't tell at this point- I stop updating his age status when I stopped caring) made an account here, caught a glimpse of my username and texted me and I had no idea it was him

Now he can see all my shit

Now my mom can see all my shit

Now my mom knows I don't mind talking to strangers

Now I'll have to block all those fifty other accounts my brother's made

Why does life gotta do me like that?
