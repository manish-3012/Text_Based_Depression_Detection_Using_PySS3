This makes no since How can I go to sleep at 5am wake up at 10am and not be tired for the whole day and being able to stay up till past 11pm on the weekend? But when on a school night I go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 6:30am I canâ€™t even stay awake for 3 hours? It makes no since. I should be dead asleep right now.
