Pretty sure i just almost passed out lol Bike, wheelie, fell on my back, hit arm, got up, held the wound, walking pain off, canâ€™t hear anything other than myself, started shaking, turned pale, got water, layed down, itâ€™s better now, still shaking a bit, anyone know if this is serious or what can have caused it? Didnâ€™t hit my head... I think
