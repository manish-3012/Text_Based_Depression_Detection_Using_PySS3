just a vent, im sad. well other than the countless other problems in my life this is one of them?

im so emotioncally unavailable to the point where it's sick?

it's been like this for months. 

thing is, emotionally unavailable, other than for one specific person.

i'm not sure why, we split our ways and i'm not particularly sad about it. it's just i'd wait a lifetime for them to show up again. 

i know i've got to move on, and actually i feel like i did. it's just not the same with other people. it just doesn't feel right.

i have a ton of other people i could choose from any time and i'm aware of that, i just choose not to. everyone is boring.

i don't know why i feel like this. i truly wouldn't mind waiting for them for a very long time if i just knew they'd come back. it's a weird feeling though, i'm calm, not very devastated or anything about them.

and yeah maybe some people would say "reach out to them" but the thing is i can't and i won't. well i can theoretically but i feel like there's no use. if they want to come back they will come back and that's what i've always told myself. i've done my part in this "relationship" already and if they feel like they want to stay away, i'll let it be like that. i'm not desperate. i've made my feelings clear in the past and i feel like that's enough of a sign that i have wanted them in my life.

and yeah, i've talked to a tooon of other people, it's just i usually end up breaking it off because i can't get their face out of my head. nobody will compare to them.

and no, not like they're some super hero of some sort, just an ordinary person with no specific special things about them. i guess their image being perfect stayed burnt into my head someday and just won't get out.

man, i just want them.
