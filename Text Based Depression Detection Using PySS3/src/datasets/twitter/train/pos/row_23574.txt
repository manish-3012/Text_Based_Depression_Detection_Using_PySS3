My parents have seen the recognition my drawing got when I posted it. they also saw the mostly supportive and critiquing comments and they've changed their opinions about "drawing wasting free time". What else can I say to you guys except thanks for everything, the support, critiquing and help changing my parents' minds.  


If you read this, have a good day and enjoy everything about your day.
