So, â€œFit Guys In Classâ€ here, Iâ€™m gonna break the mold for all of you: No. We are NOT hot chick magnets like all the memes say, we are just normal people just like everybody else. 

Now, a quick tip: if youâ€™re trying to get a girlfriend, donâ€™t think about her looks or popularity, be honest and think about: â€œHow would I feel if we were just friends?â€
Trust me just trying to hit on the hot girls will probably just make you awkward af.
