remind me to never write research papers for a living, or if I do, they will be on my terms. Ever been assigned to a research project for a topic that has almost no decent sources to use and cite from and now you are losing your mind at 3 AM trying to find 2 more viable sources for an otherwise easy assignment?

Yeah.
