This is bullshit So my friend of 5 years and another friend of 3 were planning on going outside, and they asked me if I could come. I said no because I was planning on doing hw around that time. 

So I was chilling reading reddit and popped into discord. I accidentally joined the call, and now my friend of 5 went on a giant speech about how im a hypocrite, and I would be going to hell because I left my religious school. 

He kept on talking about how I'm ret4rded and how I cant do anything. He mocks me for my opinions, and gets mad when I dont want to do something. Im decent-bad at drawing and we were planning on making a game. He then yelled at me for not doing anything, and browsing reddit all day.

This started because I said I was doing hw around 5 or 6 and couldn't come out, and now he's talking bs about religion. Im going to provide imgur links to screenshots of text messages.
