i always try to look on the bright side but i donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

the only people i genuinely felt cared about me are gone now. i have no one.

i always told people in my position, â€œno matter the darkness, no matter the storm, thereâ€™s always a peaceful light you can hold ontoâ€, but mines been snuffed out. i have nothing. no one. no reason to trudge on through my â€œlife.â€

i have no purpose. no reason. nothing.

at this point. i truly am nothing but a burden. a waste of space, time, and effort. i just donâ€™t know what to do, let alone how to do it.
