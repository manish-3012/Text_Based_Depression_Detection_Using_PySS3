The Gas Tower I am feeling a certain vibe while writing this. If you want to emulate it of sorts-please listen to this (what I was listening)

Anyway, The Gas Tower. I have been living in London for my entire life. Every day I have lived in this city I have seen this Gas Tower. It stands majestic and rigid. It is a symbol of the past, of not only just the Victorian Roots of this area- but a symbol of engineering and what I consider beauty. It stands tall outside my window and whenever I wake up, go to bed or even while I type this now- I will see it. Because it's been there so long, it reminds me of when I was younger, days I can only reminisce as cloudy and innocent. Days without exams, or stressing about girls, where friends came easy and where playing in the park just up the road was an adventure. I have only noticed recently that I have come a long way in looks and in the way I act-but not only me-the environment around me. A big blue builders depot was built behind and yet the tower stood strong. A hotel was build on the road adjacent and it still stood strong. But now the people who put it up so long ago will put it to its end. It has been a good time looking out my window and appreciating the beauty of this city. But just as I have gone elsewhere, the places around me will as well. Things will change as I do. Change is the only thing ever guaranteed. And I only ever wonder this...will these days be missed?
