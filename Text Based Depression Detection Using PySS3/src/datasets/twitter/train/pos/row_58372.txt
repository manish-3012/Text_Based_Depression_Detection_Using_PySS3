Hot pockets, ayy? Hot pockets. They're hot, they're crispy, and they're delicious. THEY'RE PERFECT! NOTHING beats a hot pocket on a cold day! My favorite is the pepperoni pizza one with that crispy, garlicky, savory crust and that gooie cheese chewy pepperoni filling. 

What's your favorite flavor of hot pocket?

p.s.: I typed this with my phone in one hand and a hot pocket in the other
