FACIAL HAIR FACIAL HAIR FACIAL HAIR on a teenage girl Hi im 14 and i have a beard. So basically i may have PCOS (poly systic ovarian syndrome) but idk. During the multiple times ive been to hospital ive found out that im low on some horemone that my adregal (idk how to spell it) gland isnt being produced and i gotta stop stressing to get to normal ; that ive got a cyst in my left ovary which explains why my periods are fucking inconsistant (ive had to wait 4 months for it then two fucking weeks later it came again) and heavy ; and not forgetting the fuck ton of testosterone causing a fuck ton of hair growth it sucks pretty bad. I dont feel nice. I could get a world record tho.
