Ight Iâ€™m gonna be real with yâ€™all I donâ€™t care if you dislike this Iâ€™m just getting my opinion out there, I think anime and watching is a fine and respectable thing to do, but some people just take it too goddamn far like I used to watch anime but I canâ€™t anymore because people just ruined it having fucking 87 body pillows jacking off exclusively to anime I just am too scared my parents think of me as someone who obsesses over anime and like I said itâ€™s fine to watch but people just wanna jack off to fucking fictional characters and I just want the community to be one that isnâ€™t seen as horny weeks in their moms basement but as just people who like Japanese cartoons. Thatâ€™s my take sorry if itâ€™s not put together well but I just have been holding this in for a bit and I wanted to get it out.
