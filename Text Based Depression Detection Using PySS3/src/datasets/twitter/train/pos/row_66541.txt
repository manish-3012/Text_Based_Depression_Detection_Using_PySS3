I want ur advice on something So there's this guy I met on reddit, I kinda have a crush on him and we get along pretty well I think,sometimes flirt and talk about weird stuff. And if he doesn't text me for a day I get a little upset. I don't wanna have a crush on him cuz I get dependent and clingy sometimes. What should I do I wanna stop my crush on him early lol 

I know it's a weird thing to ask lol
