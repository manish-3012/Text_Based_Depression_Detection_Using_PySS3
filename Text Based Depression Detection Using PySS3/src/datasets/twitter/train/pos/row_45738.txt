Did this happen to anyone else? This is probably going to be old news for a good lot of you, but I am really confused about this.

So, a good week or two ago, I was added to a subreddit titled, "[r/ClubTeenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubTeenagers/)". I checked it out, and in the description, it was saying things like, "You have been chosen by AI as well as 999 other teenagers!" I was confused, to say the least. There is not much special about me or how I write, so I thought there was some sort of mistake. I posted that I was not special, and the next thing I know, I am uninvited.

If you have any information, please let me know.
