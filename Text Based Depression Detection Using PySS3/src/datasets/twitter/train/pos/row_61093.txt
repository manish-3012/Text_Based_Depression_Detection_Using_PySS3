I literally lose braincells when I talk to my dad. So apparently my dad went to the store today and didn't wear a mask because it wasn't required there. He said that if other people were wearing theirs and it worked then why would he need to wear a mask. Then I responded with it lessens the chance of someone getting it when both people wear masks. Then my mom mentions that sometimes you can be a carrier of Corona and not have any symptoms at all. Then my dad proceeds to say it's all a "myth" and the scientists just lied about it for SOME reason. Then I tried to get through to him but my step sister decided to also say that she could "barely breathe" in the masks. Yeah my dad's a Republican. I hate it here.
