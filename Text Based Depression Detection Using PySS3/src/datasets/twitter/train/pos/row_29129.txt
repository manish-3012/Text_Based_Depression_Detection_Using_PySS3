Dealing with the scary fact about telling your best friend about dealing with verbal and physical abuse from your family Itâ€™s really scary, she wants to take me in. 

Just telling an adult about whatâ€™s going on is just nerve wrecking like the whole adoption system and knowing what happens next. 

She and her parent are researching on the process of adoption. 

Just struggling years of problems and then leaving your family to live with someone who has decided to take you in because they care about you. 

Itâ€™s really a mixed feeling.
