To everyone who doesnâ€™t use Spotify Can you guys say some nice things in the comments I feel ever so distraught by this trend of which I am not a part of. 

I even tried downloading the app 
but I donâ€™t got the wrapped
So it feel like a slapp 
I feel like a loner
Yes I am sober
And hurting all over
I listen to music a lot
But I donâ€™t got 
That Spotify pop

Thatâ€™s y I am sad
Cuz that which I had
Isnâ€™t that bad
Itâ€™s pretty rad

But I canâ€™t share it
So I canâ€™t bear it
Maybe Iâ€™ll sell it:
My apple account
Cuz it donâ€™t amount
To nothing.

Itâ€™s funny that something so meaningless
Can bring about such funny stress
U wanna cheer me up then be my guest

No I wonâ€™t take a nap
Iâ€™ll go on Reddit instead
To get this out of my head
Then maybe go to bed
YEET â€˜NOUGH SAID

NOT
I got Apple Music
Cuz thatâ€™s how I doâ€™s it
And I donâ€™t want, to ever lose it
Its just who I am
And if I am an outcast
Then I am an outcast
Just means we got contrast
Cuz we not the same
And that is okay

U follow my flow?
Then u know where to go:
Ur own direction.

So please donâ€™t be sad
Be ever so glad
That we not the same
Regardless of fame

So call me this and call me that
Say Iâ€™m just a little sap
But I shall say i got my own wrap.
Now *thatâ€™s* a ....
