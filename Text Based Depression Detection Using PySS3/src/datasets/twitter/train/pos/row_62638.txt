I am an idiot. So during one of my classes today, I joined and then basically scrolled through Reddit the entire time. I  wasn't really paying attention and was kind of surprised that my teacher did not say a single word the entire time. Then, I realized that I NEVER CONNECTED TO AUDIO. So I missed pretty much everything. Thankfully, it looks like today was supposed to be mainly an independent working day, so I didn't miss much, but I'm still a fucking idiot.

Don't do what I did
