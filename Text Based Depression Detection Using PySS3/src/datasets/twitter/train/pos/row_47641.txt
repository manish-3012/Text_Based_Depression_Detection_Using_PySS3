A Short Story
by poopy and gloop
Gloopy Glop looked at the dirty poop in his hands and felt disgust.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his smelly surroundings. He had always hated Nasty Taco Bell Restroom with its old-fashioned, old overflowing toilets. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel disgust.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Poopy Plop. Poopy was a gloppy brute with no soul leg and ginger pubes.

Gloopy gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a gloopy, poopy, diarrhea drinker with big leg and skinny pubes. His friends saw him as a dirty, decaying demon. Once, he had even helped an unsteady baby recover from a flying accident.

But not even a gloopy person who had once helped an unsteady baby recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Poopy had in store today.

The snow flurried like running dog, making Gloopy mad.

As Gloopy stepped outside and Poopy came closer, he could see the quirky glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want a hug," Poopy bellowed, in a ploppy tone. She slammed her fist against Gloopy's chest, with the force of 3998 poopy monster. "I frigging hate you, Gloopy Glop."

Gloopy looked back, even more mad and still fingering the dirty poop. "Poopy, i pooed myself," he replied.

They looked at each other with sadness feelings, like two crispy, comfortable cat pooping at a very stoppy toilet water drinking contest, which had jazz music playing in the background and two sloppy uncles peeing to the beat.

Gloopy regarded Poopy's no soul leg and ginger pubes. He held out his hand. "Let's not fight," he whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Poopy.

"Please?" begged Gloopy with puppy dog eyes.

Poopy looked happiness, her body blushing like a plastic, powerful per.

Then Poopy came inside for a nice drink of diarrhea.
