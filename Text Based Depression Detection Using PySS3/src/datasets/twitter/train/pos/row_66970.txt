Anybody else wake up and youâ€™ve done some weird shit without realising? Like today I vaguely remember waking up then going straight back to sleep after I heard my alarm

I then woke up again not long after, look on my phone and Iâ€™m on some subreddit Iâ€™ve never heard of and Iâ€™ve got 3 completely random apps downloaded (2 games and a fitness app)

Whatâ€™s the weirdest thing youâ€™ve done when waking up without realising?
