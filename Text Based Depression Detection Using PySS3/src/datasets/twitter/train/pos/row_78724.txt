Should I pull an all nighter? It's midnight rn, and I have to be up in seven hours so I feel like it's beneficial to just stay up considering I need at least ten hours to function properly. I have schoolwork that I intend on making up if I do stay up, I could do it tomorrow but I'd still be behind. Should I stay up or go to bed now?
