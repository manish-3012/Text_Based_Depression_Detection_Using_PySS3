People on this sub Iâ€™ve been on this sub for a bit so I thought Iâ€™d make some stereotypes of the people here

-Guy who wonders why no one laughs when he plays the Soviet anthem on the school bus (probs has no irl friends)

-Really mentally unstable person (75% chance itâ€™s a girl tho)

-Person who thinks their depression/anxiety is their personality

-Person who bases their personality around their sexuality

-Person whoâ€™s life is really fucked up

-Hot guy/girl looking for attention

-Cynical cunt 

-Super political dude (probs posts controversial opinions and then gets shocked when he gets downvoted)
