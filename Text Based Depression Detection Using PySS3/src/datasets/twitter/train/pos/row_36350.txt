when all the answers on the test are C My forensic science teacher gave us a form to fill our, deciding whether pieces of evidence were class or individual (aka can this piece of evidence point towards just one person or a group of people?). 

I swear to god Iâ€™m about to be the next murder suspect.

Yâ€™know why?

Because this goddamn teacher didnâ€™t ask a single question in which the answer would be â€œindividualâ€. ALL OF THEM ARE CLASS EVIDENCE. Thatâ€™s like giving a final exam and all the correct answers are C. **All of the answers are the same.**

Why does she make me doubt myself like that. I *know* that Iâ€™m right. But thereâ€™s this little voice in my head that tells me maybe Iâ€™m just going insane.
