I am the average person nowadays, hate trump, support BLM all that, but I think itâ€™s ridiculous that people think theyâ€™re in a movie They make these tik tok videos with audios from the hunger game movies and make it look like theyâ€™re in some kind of revolutionary war, itâ€™s just a ton of children trying to be taken seriously it sucks
