ðŸŽµ Hold it now! Wait a minute ðŸŽµ Come on!

Just let me catch my breath

I've heard the promises

I've seen the mistakes

I've had my fair share of tough breaks

Need a new voice, a new law, a new way

Take the time, reevaluate

It's time to pick up the pieces

Go back to square one

I think it's time for a change
