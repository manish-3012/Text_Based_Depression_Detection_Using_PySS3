Can anyone help me find this song? My friend showed it to me months ago, and I just remembered it. I figure y'all listen to similar music, or at least some of you do, so I'm trying my luck here. Also, forgive me if I sound super ignorent if this is a super popular song. I'm not a huge listener of this genre.

So, from what I remember, it was a song about a man rap battling with his...anger? The anger kept saying that he needed it to live a good life, and that they'd never cope without it. That they'd grown up together and stuff. But in the end the man pushes it away and ends his angry side. 

That was an awful description. But hopefully this works lmao.
