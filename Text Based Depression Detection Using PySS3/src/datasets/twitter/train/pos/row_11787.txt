Top 10 anime betrayals I was just starting playing Among Us for the first time with some friends and one of them was really bad at videogames so while we were playing (I know you don't have to Talk but i was giving him some tips) about remembering where you are and if you are with someone and  i was just with him and as soonest as I say that he kills me, he probably didn't even knew I was me but I felt so betrayed and at the same time trying not to cry of laughter, thanks for reading

TL;DR: I got betrayed by my friend that I was teaching him how to play and he ends up killing me while I was doing it.
