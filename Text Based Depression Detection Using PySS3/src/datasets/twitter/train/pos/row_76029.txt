Not to get political or religious or [insert label here] or anything... but people should be nice to people Yes, even if they're ugly. Yes, even if they did something that offended you once. Yes, even if they're the scum of the earth. Yes, even if you've had a rough day. Yes, even if you're stressed, tired, or upset with them. Because they're human too. Because they've had a rough day. Because everyone makes mistakes. Because everyone has a history. Because everyone was raised to have a core value or two. And they might be different from yours. And that's ok. Because they were raised differently, so of course they have a different perspective. Because they have had different experiences from you. Because no two people are the same, and it would be boring if everyone was the same. It would be great if we could frolic around on clouds made of cotton candy and never be more sad than someone who's had too many antidepressants, and never have to hear anything bad or experience anything that will make us suffer. But we can't, because actions have consequences, and cotton candy is surprisingly sticky and dissolves at a hint of rain, and overdosing on antidepressants can kill you, and we have problems that need to be spoken about before they can be fixed. Suffering shouldn't be normal, but it is, and we have to live with that, and the least we can do is not be the cause of it.
