Why am I genuinely upset with a minecraft youtuber's fanbase? So, if you don't know there was a voting for which new mob would be added to minecraft; mooblooms, iceologers, or glow squids. The results came out with glow squids winning...however they weren't exactly fair. Dream, arguably the most popular minecraft youtuber rn, had told his (extremely annoying) fanbase to all vote for the glow squid and he will follow some people who do. So, obviously his large and powerful fanbase overtook the votes and made the glow squid win. I was super hyped up about which new mob was going to be added, personally I was team moobloom, but when I realize Dream and his fans had rigged the votes it made me oddly upset. I wouldn't have minded as much if the glow squid had won organically, but the rigging of the votes just ruined the whole thing for me. Which really sucks because like everyone else I was super hyped for the Cave Update, but the rigging ruined my mood. Now I have an intense hatred to Dream, his stans, and glow squids (WHICH DON'T EVEN GLOW).
