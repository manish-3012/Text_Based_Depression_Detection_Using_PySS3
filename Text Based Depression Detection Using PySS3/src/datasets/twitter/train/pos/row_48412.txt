Online school concerns In my previous year of highschool I was an A and B student, I didnâ€™t get any câ€™s because our last marking period would add 6 points to all you grades and would deduct any for doing work. This is not my concern however, recently in online school our quizzes allow you to look at the notes when doing them. Because of this my will to focus and pay attention in class has significantly gone down. I mean I have all Aâ€™s but I havenâ€™t learned a damn thing. Iâ€™m worried that when I get out of online school I wonâ€™t be used to just looking at my notes rather than memorizing things. What should I do
