Why do mood swings suck so bad?? (Baby rant) Bruh these things came from hell, and they suck. One moment they make my sad then angry then happy then tired. It's so exhausting. Why the hell do they even exist? Or maybe I just got another issue that isn't mood swings, idk.


If mood swings were represented in a person, I would kick them in the balls. Fuck you fuck you fuck you, mood swings.
