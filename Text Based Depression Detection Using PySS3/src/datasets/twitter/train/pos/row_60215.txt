My town's hero https://youtu.be/IO-2OMKFcWM

This are the translated lyrics:

*Mumbling* 
The seed, the seed, the marijuana seed.
*Mumbling non sense*
*More nonsense*
The seed, the seed, the marijuana seed.

Truly an amazing masterpiece by my town's more recognized artist.
What a place
What a hero
What a marijuana seed.

(I'm ranting about how it makes me sad that this man is the biggest symbol of my town but just to clarify, showing you this doesn't hurt him in any level, being listened by people Is the thing that makes him happy the most, and he has never shown any regret for uploading this video of him under the effect of drugs, in fact, he Is proud. So don't worry)
