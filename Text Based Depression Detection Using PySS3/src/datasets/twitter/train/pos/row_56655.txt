so... we finally broke up if youâ€™re active on this subreddit, youâ€™ve probably heard about my relationship problems before. I post quite a lot from my relationship, which I do regret in a sense. 

but looking back, i guess that really shows how unhealthy it was. but anyway, he broke up with me because I got mad at him when I was going on a rant about my dead father, and he said â€œyou know I donâ€™t like talking about thisâ€ when the topic of the conversation was â€œI feel Iâ€™m being forced to forget him because I have nobody to talk to about itâ€. 

if you had seen one of my posts in the past, you probably wouldâ€™ve looked and gone â€œbreak up with himâ€ or â€œwow thatâ€™s toxicâ€. 

anyways. itâ€™s over now. yay.
