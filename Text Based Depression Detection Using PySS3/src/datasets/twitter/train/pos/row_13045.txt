My mom said I looked like a boy as an insult (For context, I'm a cis girl)

So I got an oversized dark grey hoodie on AliExpress (it's adorable in my opinion), and I was feeling really cute while wearing it, and decided to ask my mom what she thought about it.

She said I looked like a tramp. I told her that it wasn't that bad, and she answered with a "no, you look great! Just like any other **boy** your age." I just acted as if she had told me something horrible, but frankly, I don't care. It's just the fact that she used looking like a boy as an insult that bothers me. 

Wtf mom
