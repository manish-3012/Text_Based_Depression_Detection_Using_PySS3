back to school i guess iâ€™ve been doing co-op at a goat farm this quad , and today was my last day. next week is my â€œmarchâ€ break but after that, back to actual school. back to schoolwork. back to sitting in class praying nobody looks at me. back to uniforms. back to getting on the bus every morning at 7:07am. back to having my heart race every time a male teacher purposely walks behind me up the stairs because the uniform kilts are fucking SHORT. asscheeks almost hanging out short. back to literally having to wear the kilts because the pants are not designed to fit female bodies. back to being around racist/transphobic people. back to hearing awful shit-talking in the bathroom. back to the vice principal aggressively asking what iâ€™m doing every time she sees me in the hall. back to my teachers singling me out. back to teachers penalizing me because my work isnâ€™t as good as neurotypical/non learning-disabled students. back to being forced to speak infront of the class where nobody knows me. back to being â€œthe new kidâ€ at the school. back to seeing my peers whom i was great friends with 4 years ago but cannot stand my presence anymore. back to my parents texting me everyday needing to know what iâ€™m doing in school because i donâ€™t live with them anymore. back to grade 7/8s being grade 7/8s. back to seniors looking at me like a child , back to freshmen/sophomores gawking at me constantly. 


back to my own little hell in this fucking town.
