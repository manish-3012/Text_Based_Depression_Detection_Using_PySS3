My little brother got bullied for playing Minecraft He isnt a teenager but I didnt know anywhere other than here to ask it. It was actually cool to play Minecraft in my time so I let my 3rd grade little brother to use my mansion (actually looks good like the ones on google, Im pretty competent) for his background in his online classes as a joke (becuz he cant build that obv). But then I learn that he got bullied because "Minecraft is trash bro" I think those kids think that Fortnite is the only cool game and the saddest part is some kids also said that the mansion sucks because its not made of quartz (idk why they said this). I am also tied up in this situation becuz its online classes. Id love some advice
