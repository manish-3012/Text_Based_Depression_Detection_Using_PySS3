Can I report my mom for making me wear pullups?? This is weird and embarrassing to talk about so please donâ€™t make fun of me too much.. but for as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve had bed wetting problems,(during the day too but only if I canâ€™t make it to a restroom) Iâ€™ve had multiple doctor visits for it and Iâ€™m actually seeing a psychiatrist for it now. The medication Im taking for it is an antidepressant or something I think but it makes me like really mad when I take it so hopefully I can get it changed. 
Iâ€™ve been trying a lot of just natural things to not do it as much and Iâ€™m down to like three or four accidents a week at night and maybe one or two during the day. it was almost every night before I started trying stuff on my own. 
I got in a huge argument with my mom last night though because I Hate! Wearing pullups omg. If Iâ€™m down to a few accidents a week I feel like I shouldnâ€™t have to wear them all the time? If itâ€™s not happening more than it happens it just doesnâ€™t make sense to me? But sheâ€™s talking about like if it only happened once a month it would be okay to not wear them. I canâ€™t even imagine doing it that little tbh. Sheâ€™s crazy! How often would a normal person say is okay to not have to wear them? 
But do you guys thinks itâ€™s legal to like not be allowed to wear anything over them at night?? Because I have to get ready for bed around 7 but most of the time I donâ€™t even lay down until like midnight because my adhd meds.... so thats a long time to not be wearing clothes just to make laundry a little easier right? 
I kinda feel like sheâ€™s just trying to make it embarrassing tbh. But idk if thatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to be or not? 
I was really close to not having to deal with that but right before I started trying stuff on my own we stayed the night at my moms friends house, I was wearing sweatpants and lied about having one on under them which would have been fine and all but I fell asleep on one of their new couches and freaking peed all over it. But my mom actually got mad about it though and it sucked for me because I had to clean it in front of her and her friend and her friends kid IN NOTHING BUT A PULLUP because my clothes were soaked so she made me put one on and I was crying so it was just a mess. Plus she had to add that her friends kid was half my age and he wouldnâ€™t even have done that...Thanks mom. So Iâ€™m pretty sure half the reason for not wearing anything over them is because she just wants to see it and that makes me even more mad.Sry for venting): but can I report her for this??
