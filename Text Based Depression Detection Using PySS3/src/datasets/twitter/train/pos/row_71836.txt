2. Quebec (theyâ€™ve done ALOT of weird shit)

3. Saskatchewan (driving thru here n seeing nothing but prairies + the capital rhymes with vagina)

4. British Columbia (i love bc so much but *almost* all the people ive met from here have been so.....ðŸ¤¨)

5. Nova Scotia (nothing against them but one of my uncles lives here n heâ€™s a terrible person)

6. Newfoundland &amp; Labrador (u guys r okay i just dont like how ur called â€˜newfiesâ€™ its a bit strange innit)

7. New Brunswick (no opinion but u have the word new in it so automatic reduction however the capital has a cute name ! )

8. Prince Edward Island (no opinion but u guys seem cute)

9. Ontario (i had alot of fun here but u guys have some weirdos ngl)

11. Yukon (tied with nw territories. dunno what yall do lol but whitehorse is such a banger nameðŸ˜«)

12. Northwest Territories (only tied with yukon bc who tf names land after kim &amp; kanyes kid ?? but also the name of their capital is so cool)

13. NUNAVUT (the people that live there are extremely isolated n barely get any recognition &amp; they add to the land mass of canada)
