I was today years old when I realized that ppl say â€œYou wouldnâ€™t survive a cod lobbyâ€ unironically. I really thought it was just a satirical joke that people said ðŸ˜€

â€œYou do realize the f word is slur, so lgbt people are naturally going to avoid you if you say it because youâ€™re not apart of that community.â€

â€œYOu WOulDNT SURvIvE A cOd LoBbYâ€
