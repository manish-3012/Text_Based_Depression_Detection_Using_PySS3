I think I always have the same three apps open on my phone And thatâ€™s reddit, discord and spotify.

Makes sense because Iâ€™m always listening to music and on reddit. I also go on discord a lot but not nearly as much as in reddit. 

I used to have four tabs open on my laptop at all time. They were netflix, reddit, discord and one other thing (nothing nsfw, I just donâ€™t wanna say) but I had to delete it because my sister wanted to borrow my laptop. 

So now you know that, but anywyas howâ€™re you?
