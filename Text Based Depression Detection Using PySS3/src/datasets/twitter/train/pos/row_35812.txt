Why is nothing fun anymore? Nothing is fun. I can't watch youtube for more then 10 minutes at a time, anime is getting really boring and repetitive, manga is basically the same and games are boring. I have nothing that interests me anymore. Even being horny is making me feel guilty lol. but i am seriously seriously bored. I put on an act at school like I am this 'crazy weird kid that everyone knows' but like that's just not me. Honestly, I am getting tired of being bored everywhere. There is nothing bad happening in my life but like I am just not happy. There's no reason for it so why? Anyway I am just waffling now so like thanks for reading or whatever.
