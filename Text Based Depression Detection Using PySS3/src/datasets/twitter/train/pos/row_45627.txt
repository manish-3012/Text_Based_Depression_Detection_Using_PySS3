I'm taller than my dad and it makes me a little sad. I hadn't seen my dad in a little less than three weeks because i was a little busy. Besides me being busy i just didn't reach out that weekend. 
When i got to his place this weekend he opened the door with a big grin and he told me that my face got slimmer each time he saw me. (I'm losing weight like crazy rn.) 
Then this afternoon he told me i had grown taller than him. I always thought it would be a victorious moment and that i'd tease him about it, but instead it was a little sad. Because after leaving his place i realised that i'd never be smaller than my dad again. I don't know if i'm being dramatic but it was just a sad thought to me.
