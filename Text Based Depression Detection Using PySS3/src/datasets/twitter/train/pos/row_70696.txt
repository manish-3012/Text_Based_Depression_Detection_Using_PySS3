I saw this post on Instagram about how the word 'pussy' is used to signify cowardice and fear and here are some things I wanted to elaborate So the second part of this post was talking about how the word balls are used to signify bravery and masculinity

Now I understand why people have a problem with it and It makes sense and I agree with them

But in the same fashion the word 'dick' should not be sign of being a bad person because that then signifies that men are assholes

So if your gonna say you have a problem with pussy being used as a deragotory term the word dick shouldn't be synonymous to an asshole
Thank you for coming to my ted talk
