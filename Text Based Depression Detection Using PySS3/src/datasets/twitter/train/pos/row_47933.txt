Idk how to tell a girl I like her So in my group of friends in the town I spend every summer I've met a new girl. The thing is that I've never kissed a girl and I don't know how to tell her because when she's alone with or when there are not so much people she tells me: I love you...( I don't in which way), she hugs me everytime, she sits really close to me, she kisses me everywhere but my mouth, and I of course do it back and she even (as a joke?) Touches me down there (and lets me touch her boobs...). But when one of our friends say something like: you two should kiss or something similar, she inmediately refuses it and even sometimes gets annoyed with the person who said it.

 I don't want to be his boyfriend because she will leave this town in about 3 to 10 days (We don't know exactly how much) and I won't see her in about 6 months, but I want at least kiss her but I don't know how to do it because I've never done it before.

I might have something that will benefit me because this night, tomorow's night and maybe even the next one we will do a party which may result in me asking her because of the alcohol that we will drink.

The thing that I can't understand is the reaction of her when someone says anything about us in public, but I don't know.

If there's still someone there I would appreciate a lot if you can tell me something to do, thank you.
