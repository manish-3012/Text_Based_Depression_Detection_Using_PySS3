Ok Reddit, youâ€™ve finally broken me.... I was going through the comments on a  Makemesuffer post and someone said, â€œOH GOD, WHERES THE EYE BLEACH?â€ And this WONDERFUL (complete opposite) person replied â€œR/ Eyeblech and I ignored the NSFW tag like an idiot cause I was expecting puppies and kittens.... BUT NO, I find multiple pictures of people hanging them selves and a cartel group cutting open a guy, and a dude getting his arm chopped off.... but what finally sent me was a picture of how much blood came from a miscarriage and also the halfway formed body of the baby, and to say the least... I wonâ€™t be sleeping tonight... so to that one guy that replied with that horrid subreddit, screw you.
