Quick Break up question (I am an absolut idiot about connections to people and relationships).

Me and my girlfriend broke up 3 months ago (well more her than me). Since we had absolute no contact. Since four days she is watching all my updates on social media. Does it happen just by accident while checking her friends'?or what the hell does that mean?

Yeah yeah look at that idiot, thinks he could hope for some bullshit.
