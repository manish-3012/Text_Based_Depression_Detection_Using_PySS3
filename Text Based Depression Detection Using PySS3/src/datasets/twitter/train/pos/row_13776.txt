El cheapo easy meal Like myself, someone us are going to college this month, may I learn yall a thing that is super easy and anyone can do (if you live at home or if your dorm has a kitchen lmao) 
What you need 
-Stew meat (pre cut steak, usually cheap cause its meant for other things)
- soy sauce
- teriyaki sauce (lawrys is my go to)
- garlic powder 
- onion powder
Prep
Put your meat in a large bowl, add the sauces, about 3 parts teriyaki to 1 part soy

Add your powders like before about 3 parts garlic, 1 part onion

Amounts of everything vary per persons preference so experiment 

Hand mix, cover and put in fridge at least over night 

When its meal time simply pour the bowl into a pan, cook the steak to your liking, pair with white rice, drizzle a little teriyaki sauce over everything 


And boom easy Teriyaki steak that tastes great and a fraction of the cost.
