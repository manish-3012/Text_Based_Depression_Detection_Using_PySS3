I just made someone's son so happy, and I myself, couldn't be any happier. So the kid I'm talking about was "begging" for games but he was THIS close to sharing any info that should not be revealed. He also wanted to "gameshare" with me so I showed him how to do it by giving him a burner account with Knack 2. After all this madness, his mother sent me a message, apologized and in the end I let him keep the burner, and was so happy. I feel so goddamn great right now.
