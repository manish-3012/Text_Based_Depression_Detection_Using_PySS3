Evolution kinda spooky ngl We've not really evolved yo thrive in any climate e.g were not hairy for the cold. Not a big surface area for the heat we can't hold our breath for long. Its like we evolved somehow knowing we'd live in a advanced civilization. I'm not religious or anything but this seems kinda weird unless I'm missing something here lol
