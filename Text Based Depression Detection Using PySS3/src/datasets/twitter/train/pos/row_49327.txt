Why are my grandparents so mean? Today, I finally showed them something that I forgot to show them: the honor roll certificate I got from school for getting above average grades, and they straight up just ignore the thing and start yelling at me for not setting the table to eat when it's like 6pm and we eat dinner at 6:30, after that they promptly go into a lecture into how I am stupid by comparing me to my sister, my dad, my mom, pretty much everyone. And as SOON as I tell them to shut up, they just look at me like I'm some lunatic and start raising their voices to the point where my ears ring really loud after they finish yelling at me.

Not to also mention the amount of times they make fun of my dreams, my habits, my body, and they STILL have the gall to ask why do I seem like I hate them! I mean it might be that they are doing it for my own good, but how is it good for you to have two people call you brainless, and as soon as you counter that you are not stupid they start getting seriously mad and get louder? They don't even bother to hide the tone of disgust in their voices!

I know it's none of your business and all but I just want to know what do you think and if you people are with me that my grandparents are jerks.

PS it's the grandparents from my dad's side, my grandparents from my mother's side is chill.
