i think i had a moment with my crush and we 100% blew it context: i was out with my crush and my future class, we were there for 5 hours and then met up today for 6, this time alone, she will commutes to the city by train for 40 km (24 miles for american pesants)  


anyway, we were about to say bye to each other and instead of hugging or something we just looked into each other eyes for like 8 seconds before she went on train. FML  


how do i advance from that? pls help
