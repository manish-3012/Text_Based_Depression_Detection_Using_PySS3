this might be an unpopular opinion but like say what you want about performative activism but

i think its better than just not doing anything at all. a girl signing petitions and posting awareness on her story for attention is 100 times better than someone just not posting anything at all.

sure their intentions are flawed and theyre doing it for a shitty reason, but theyre still doing it. and some people viewing that story could be more inclined to actually educate themselves because they saw someone post about it

but if no one posted anything, it would probably just be a lot worse

thoughts?
