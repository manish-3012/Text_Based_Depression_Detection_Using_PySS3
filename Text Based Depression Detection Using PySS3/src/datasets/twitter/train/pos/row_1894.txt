How to convince my mom into letting me play my favourite game for 1 hour a day? Yea so the title explains most of the issue. The thing is, I'm willing to sacrifice most of my other pleasures for this.

I don't have a decent phone, I play on my Mom's phone, which is a major issue. The game I'll be talking about is CoDM, its a pretty great game.

After a series of small arguments with my mother, she stopped giving me her phone to play my game.

I really liked playing it so I have been wanting to get back in the community. 

I really don't like confrontation and presenting my deal so I would need your help in this.

I am most certainly capable of reducing my computer usage etc. just for this 1 hour of happiness of the day

Pls halp. (â™¡Ë™ï¸¶Ë™â™¡)
