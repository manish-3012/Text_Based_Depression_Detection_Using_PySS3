I'm close to killing myself I'm so sorry. I love everyone. And I know people will miss me. But I think this might be the final straw.


&gt;You'll probably never understand what I just lost

&gt;Sorry. I don't want to make this harder for u or anything so I won't say anything more


Yes because what I've just lost is my life. You gave it to me then took it away. I love you. I'll miss you. And I'm so sorry that you'll have to go through life without me. I have no idea how you'll manage and I can't stand to live and continue worrying about it.



I never should've entered your life. I never should've made you love me. I never should've been given life by you. I love you, but this is goodbye for good
