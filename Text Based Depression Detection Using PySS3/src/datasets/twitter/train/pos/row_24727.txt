my friend had to cancel plans for the weekend and i feel like iâ€™m being too mean to her so on monday she kept on asking to come over to my house and we got really excited and started making plans and stuff 

anyway now itâ€™s Wednesday night and she told me that the plans were too complicated and that she couldnâ€™t come over and that she was sorry 

i really do want to be nice about it but i just feel sad that she couldnâ€™t hang out and i felt like she didnâ€™t even want to hang out as much anymore. today i asked her if she still wanted to and she said â€œnoâ€ jokingly but i felt like she was covering something up
