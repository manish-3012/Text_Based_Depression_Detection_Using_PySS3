Oftentimes, intervening with peoples problems is the worst thing you can do. More often than not, I have found from my experience that constantly reasurring and affirming someone, allowing them to resolve their own problems while supporting them, is a far better solution than doing it for them. When someone with depression resolves their own problems, they feel as though they have accomplished it themselves and that it a far greater benefit than feeling they needed someone to support them.
