Im having a bi-panic rn I just learned about the gay panic defense recently and im honestly just shocked how much lgbt phobia there still is. Dont even get me started on western countries.
Im legit terrified of traveling to other countries now.

Also, im sick of all the biphobia, especially from the lgbt community. 
Im not out yet, but im already sick of it
