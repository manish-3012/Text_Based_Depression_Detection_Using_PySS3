No where else to post this This happend before I had reddit but I'm so happy (: my cat actually loves me. I used to sit on the living room floor to play video games, and some how my cat got got in to the house (he usually is inside) but when he did he put a big and I mean BIG Bird and put it exactly where I sit. That means that instead of eating the bird or whatever cats do with animal carcasses, but he put it where I would see it so I could be fed. My cat caught a big ass bird just for me and I love him so much for that.
