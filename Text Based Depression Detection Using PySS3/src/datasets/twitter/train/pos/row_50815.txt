I need yâ€™alls help So, my ex gf is now my ex bf? But how do I call the relationship? Is it chronologically aligned? Do I call him my ex bf, or do I count it as a gf because he was a she when I was with him? My head hurts. I asked him about it and he was just â€˜idk, it confuses me tooâ€™ so we spent like half an hour online puzzling it out.
