Athletic teens I need help Ok so Iâ€™m going to the gym (planet fitness) for the first time tomorrow, Iâ€™m 230 pounds 5,8 Iâ€™m not super tall and itâ€™s a lot of weight but honestly I donâ€™t look 230 I know people with similar heights but less weight and they look fatter than me, anyways thatâ€™s not the point, the thing is I donâ€™t know what to do, of course Iâ€™m going to go to the treadmills because thatâ€™s like the most basic thing you do at the gym but what else should I do? My goal is to be 200 or less by New Years and 160-150 by next summer, are my goals too unrealistic? Itâ€™s late where I live so I might not reply to the comments until tomorrow
