FILL OUT A SURVEY AND HELP A TEENAGER WRITE ABOUT OTHER TEENAGERS Hi guys!

so I am the editor/creator of newsletter/magazine thingy. It's super new and our first issue goes out on May 2nd. Anyway, I'm writing a article about the Horseshoe theory. If you have heard of it before, then this survey is for you. 

 I am trying to be as unbiased as possible, and stick to the facts and data. The Survey doesn't keep your emails, there is ONE semi-personal question and it is optional. I just really need more people to take it its pretty short and you don't have to write much. 

If this seems like something that you are not totally against taking, here is the link: [https://forms.gle/eS374Lrjkxu2LFFu5](https://forms.gle/eS374Lrjkxu2LFFu5)
