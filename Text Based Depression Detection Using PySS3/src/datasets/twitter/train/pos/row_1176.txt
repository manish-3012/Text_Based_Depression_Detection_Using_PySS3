What would you do if you were sentenced to life in prison? Iâ€™d honestly end it. No point in living in a place like prison. People donâ€™t have â€œlivesâ€ in there. No one does anything truly worthwhile in a soulless hellhole like that. Where the only emotions that exist are hatred and despair. Why donâ€™t they let people just choose to die in there? Itâ€™s eternal, endless, brutal torture.
