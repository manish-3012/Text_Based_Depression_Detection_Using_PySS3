Why am I tired so much... I have a cup of coffee in the morning, and I usually get a full 7 hours of sleep and Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t have the motivation to do anything... I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed. 

I took a 2 hour nap earlier, after getting a 10 hour sleep last night. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m very close to 15, and I just want advice with this
