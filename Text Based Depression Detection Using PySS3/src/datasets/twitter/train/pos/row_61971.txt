Suicide isn't cool You might be 'tired' of life, but killing yourself will not make things better... Mainly because, you won't get the satisfaction of feeling that tiredness ending because... y'know... you'll be dead.

Suicide doesn't bring satisfaction or anything like that, you just cease to exist boom (unless you believe in an afterlife or reincarnation etc. in which case - you can't be certain anyway so it's still a bad thing to do).

You get one life, it might be shit right now but that pain is temporary in the vast majority of cases.

I think I read a statistic of people who survived suicide attempts and the vast majority immediately regretted it.

If you feel suicidal, talk to someone, reach out, nothing good will come from keeping it all to yourself. 

Stay safe.
