Guys I am feeling really happy now. My friends are really treating me well recently. And for once I can laugh a lot. Actual honest laughter. I am really appreciating the change that I am going through. Now, I can even let out my feelings truthfully from my heart and there is always someone to listen to my problems. The past me would be extremely proud of how present me turned out. The amount of times I think of suicide have vastly decreased thanks to the presence of my good friends. All in all, I am really elated with the change in myself.
