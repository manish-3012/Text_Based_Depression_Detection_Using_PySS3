How should I convince my dad to let me buy some anime figures There are these two Hatsune Miku figures I want on Amazon and the price (total) is $64. He says itâ€™s expensive but I can afford them. Iâ€™m sure some of you have had this problem before and now have an insane collection but these would be my first figures.
