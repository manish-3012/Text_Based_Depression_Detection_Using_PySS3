I need some advice about school and a girl So, Iâ€™m going back to school in September and itâ€™ll either be online or in person with whatever measures Alberta decides. If I do go back, Iâ€™ve got a good half-face respirator and a metric fuck-ton of P100 filters. I had all that before the pandemic, donâ€™t ask.

Iâ€™m lucky enough to have the choice between online or in person school. This is kinda bad because thereâ€™s this girl who I kinda like. I donâ€™t have any of her contact details or anything so I have no way of contacting her. Iâ€™m pretty sure she likes me too or at least used to. Havenâ€™t spoken to her for quite a long time, probably not since January. I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s doing but I should find out next month.

If I go to school in person and change my mind about things, I can probably switch to online. If I do online school and change my mind, I might not be able to go to school in person depending on the measures they put in place, especially if theyâ€™re doing the whole â€œgo in person these days, do it on your computer these daysâ€ thing. 

Iâ€™ll probably go to school in person if they do the thing I mentioned in the end of the last paragraph. Only problem is is my parents think that I donâ€™t want to go to school. I could certainly convince them to let me but Iâ€™d need to make a good excuse and the conversation would be extremely awkward. I am fucking horrible at math so Iâ€™ll do that class online regardless of what Iâ€™m doing due to the fact online math classes are easier than ones in person. Iâ€™ll actually be doing grade 10 and 11 math next year if itâ€™s possible so I can get it out of the way. Thankfully I donâ€™t need grade 12 math for a political science course in university!

My freshman year was both shitty and pretty fun. I made an ass of myself, made people laugh both with and at me, and most importantly I barely passed for the most part. Grade 10 is when shit gets real. I really hope that I get myself together next year.

Where I live, there are barely any cases of the Wuhan coronavirus but very few people have the brain cells to wear a fucking mask. My school will almost certainly mandate masks so I donâ€™t need to worry about that. Plus, Iâ€™ve got the respirator and if need be, Iâ€™ve also got a full-face version that uses the exact same filters. So, should I go to school part-time and wear the respirator, or just stay at home and feel like absolute shit for another year or more?

TL;DR: I own a respirator (2, actually) and have many P100â€™s. School will open but we will only be allowed on certain days in different groups. Thereâ€™s a girl who might like me but I canâ€™t contact her. I can do completely online school instead but I donâ€™t wanna. Parents think I wanna stay at home. Should I stay or should I go?
