Why is my life like this When I was 8 I started learning guitar my dad got drunk and smashed it then when I was 13 I was learning piano and my mom threw it out the window and it was stolen before I got down stairs and outside. And now Iâ€™m 17 and my dad constantly tells me how I should be able to play an instrument like all his gfâ€™s kids. Why is my life like this
