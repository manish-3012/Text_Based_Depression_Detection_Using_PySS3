Not exactly my brightest day but idc 2 not very good things happened

A. Missed gym, waited until 6pm for the bus, didn't arrive, so I just left to go home, there's a lockdown from 8pm to 6am so even if the bus arrived at 6 I would probably be at gym by 6:30, the last bus back home is at 7pm and if I wanted to walk home I'd have to be out by 7:15 unless I want to sprint my way back home, so I thought not worth it to go for 30-45 minutes

B. I got reset in gta online, putting this here for no reason, idc about it, I was cheating, probably added like $200-300 million worth of money and properties, only got reset probably suspended, it wouldn't matter even if I got permanently banned, I have 6 other accounts and even if I got banned in all of them gta is like $15 nowadays, I've spent more than that in microtransactions for pubg mobile and cod mobile lol, by more I mean $20 but it doesn't matter
