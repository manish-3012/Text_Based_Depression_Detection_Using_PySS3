How do you guys deal with mental stress I had the option to google or to check any other article or sub reddit for that matter. But I want to hear from you people. My father is one of the most toxic people I have ever seen in my life. I am ashamed to be called his son and he doesn't deserve to be a human alive. He's a devil in human form. There have been some money issues lately with my mother's family. We are fairly rich whereas the family of my mother is somewhat poor. I can't give details but he is blackmailing my mom and saying things which you can't even imagine. We had fight for 16 times in a single day. I am a 16M btw. He's a total fucking douchebag. Also my mom is crying and what my father is doing to us is nothing less than mental harrasment. This has been the first time in my life for such situation to occur. Also my mom told me that he was always toxic but just behaved nice in front of other people. He once kicked my mom in back when she was pregnant for 5 months for absolute BS reason. I want to ask you guys those who have been through or are going through similar situation, what should be done. The mental toll on me is also far too great to handle by myself and I am afraid that I might kill that bastard if things don't cooldown for next 2-3 days. Please give me advice which is applicable for both me and my mom.
