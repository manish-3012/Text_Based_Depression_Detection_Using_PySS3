Old story:my crush was a pianist and I tried to impress her... I told her I could play Fur Elise and she was immediately intrigued,and she was so excited and interested in hearing what I had to say next,but obviously needless to say she got dissapointed and unimpressed when I told her "yeah,on piano tiles ;)"

it was thought text but I'm pretty sure i made her laugh a little,I'd like to assume that at least.
