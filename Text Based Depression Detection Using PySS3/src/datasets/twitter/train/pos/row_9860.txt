I tried to impress my crush by showing her my backwards long jump skills in SM64 Its super cringy, but me being me, a stupid 6th grader, (8th grader now), I was like, Ooh! Let me show my crush my [backwards long jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKBmJTdNvjE) skills from a video a recorded in Super Mario 64! I showed her.  She was like, "cool... umm... bye next period!" And my 6th grader self be like, "yes". I am an idiot. I also used to walk around 6th grade and talked bout big yoshi and kirby because i thought it was funny, but nobody laughed, so i stopped over time.
