How do I tell my old best friend I don't want to really hang out anymore? Now when we first met we were amazing friends. We hung out every day and sometimes over 6 hours at a time. Our friendship is going downhill. He has lied, broke a lot of my things on "accident" (including a $150 flare gun) and a bunch of things my grandma gave to me. He said he'll fix EVERYTHING. Now at the start, he convinced me he was soooooooo cool. (He is 12). I met his best friend who knew him since they were born. She told me he isn't as tough as I thought he was and is uh not very cool. Fast forward, he is "trying" to fix some of my nerf guns that my grandma gave to me that he took apart. He said he can modify them. He hasn't put them back together and when I tried to confront him about it. He just left my house. I want him to fix my things but don't want to be friends with him anymore. He lies, ignores me, breaks my shit and doesn't do anything about it. How do I tell him with him still being able to fix the things he broke?
