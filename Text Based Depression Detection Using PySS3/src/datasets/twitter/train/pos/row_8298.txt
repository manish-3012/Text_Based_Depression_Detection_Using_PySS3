Thanks a lot reddit! This is surely gonna get downvoted to oblivion but I have to say it. 
Reddit. Stop. 
Big hero 6 was one of my favourite movies growing up. It was one of the most wholesome movies I had ever watched. I loved the plot and the characters. I used to re-watch it every single month, because it would take me back to my pure and clean childhood. 
You guys must be aware of the trending meme template. "Aunt Cass's Rack". Why did this stupid idiot need to make it. Why did he/she need to spoil the movie for me. Why did reddit have to turn a wholesome movie into a porno?
(There have been posts about youtube videos making porn vids out of the movie's characters. These videos have horrendous stuff in them)
Why did u need to do this reddit. There are pornstars, thousands of them. Go show your horny to them. Go jack of to pornstars. Why did u need to ruin one of my best childhood memories. 
No, I am not horny 
No, aunt Cass isn't sexually attractive
No, I can't just take it as a joke
No, I don't care about my karma coz all I wanted was to rant. 
And yeah, to the guy who made the edit, HAVE A BIG FUCK YOU FROM MY SIDE.
