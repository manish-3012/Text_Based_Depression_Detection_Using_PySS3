Wth is wrong with my family?? My mom asked me which president I would vote for if I could vote, I said Biden, and now she started texting my dad behind my back. She texted me in accident so I caught her red handed. I got reasonably angry about this, but now I have to walk to school as punishment. Someone shoot me already.
