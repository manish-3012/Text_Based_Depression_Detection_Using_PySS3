What should I do now guys? So to make a long story short Iâ€™ve been bullied since the 4th grade with essentially no breaks from it besides being away from school. So fast forward to now Iâ€™m in high school after Iâ€™ve become fit ,more confident, and started training martial arts and now assholes are fucking with me again. They literally berated me so bad the other day I had to stop myself from caving in their faces so I told the teacher what happened(it all happens in my PE class which is my last one btw) and he said he would look into it. So I take the high road and talked to the Vice Principal about it he pulled them aside and tried to talk with them and they stopped for today but what happens if this continues? Iâ€™ll only accomplish so much by getting them in trouble and theyâ€™ll just move on to the next weakest person and I want them to stop all together so that way no one has to feel that way again. What should I do if this persists?
