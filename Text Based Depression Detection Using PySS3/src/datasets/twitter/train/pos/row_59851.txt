Guys (or girls) of r/teenagers, let her KNOW what you want and don't be subtle about it!! Why the hell was I never like this? I thought that I sucked with girls for the longest time but I've only now realized that the best way to win them over is by being SUPER straight forward and honest. Like genuinely just tell her exactly what you want. Even if you're just looking to fuck, TELL HER THAT. They like the confidence and the fact that you're not afraid to speak your mind. Trust me, it'll work.

Let me hear your guys/girls thoughts on this :)
