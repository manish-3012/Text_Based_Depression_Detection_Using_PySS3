Iâ€™ve had 3 honors classes taken from me because of COVID I normally keep this shit to myself because I know that no one cares or asked but itâ€™s getting a bit annoying now. 

So I was supposed to have all classes honors this year but due to COVID the English Honors class was too small and there was a lack of teachers(many are teaching virtual classes). So I was put in English CP, however this also took me out of History honors because I need English honors to have World History honors. Now the same thing is happening to my Algebra class.

It is affecting my gpa. Itâ€™s not much but when you get up to 4.7 another .1 (probably more)is really quite nice to have. Now I need to get 95% in CP to get the same grade a 90% would get me in honors. Pain.
