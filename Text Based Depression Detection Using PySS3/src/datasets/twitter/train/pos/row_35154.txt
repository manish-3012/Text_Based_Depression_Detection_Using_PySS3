I just made this meal from an idea and itâ€™s really good 1 - Get chicken nuggets and put them in the microwave

2-when there is 30 second left can some cheese and put a piece so it goes from top to bottom, basically a small strip of cheese

3 - microwave for the rest of the 30 seconds so the cheese melts

4 - Get some ketchup and make a line going across the cheese

5 - lightly salt the ketchup

6 - Eat it cuz itâ€™s really good
