Listen up bitchbois. As much I hate online classes what I hate more is kids bullying teachers in the online class. 
I mean that this boomer right here worked it's whole life by going to school and now they are sitting behind a screen getting trolled by 14 y/o olds. 
It's different when you mess with kids your age. 
Also it wastes alot of time tbh. 
Please stop doing so.
