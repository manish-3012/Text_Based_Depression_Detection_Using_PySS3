I canâ€™t stop crying and I want to die and nobody cares. The last time I vented to this subreddit almost everyone told me that I was a piece of shit, and that I should just â€œbe betterâ€ or work harder or some fucking bullshit

Nobody ever listens to what I have to say unless itâ€™s dumb memey shit, I feel so alone

What even is the fucking point in anything 

The only reason I donâ€™t kill myself is because donâ€™t know how and it would hurt my brother and possibly my best friend. I donâ€™t think anyone else miss me for very long. 

My best friend seemed like the only person who even cared about me and would go out of their way to talk to me, but they didnâ€™t care to actually interact with me for days 

I should probably just fucking die because I canâ€™t â€œbe betterâ€ like all you shitfaces want me to
