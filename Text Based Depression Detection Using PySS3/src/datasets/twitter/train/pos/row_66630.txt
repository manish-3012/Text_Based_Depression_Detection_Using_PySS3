I DID IT today i punched the bully in his nose with all my strength. 2 years of rage fuelled that punch 
His nose was bleeding but that made me feel even better idc if he comes again with more friends i have done my part hopefully his nose wont recover another 2 months cuz next time i see him he is going back on a stretcher
