Is it my responsibility to clean up my 18 year old's brothers mess? I want an honest opinion so I am going to be as unbiased as possible. My brother and I share a room. My brother believes I should tidy his mess because I sleep there and he tidies my mess. However I am saying that all I do is sleep there and it would be almost impossible or very rare as I only spend an average of 10 minutes in the room not sleeping. I proposed what I thought was fair, that we should clean up after ourselves and we are responsible for our own mess. However he believes someone should clean the whole room. I personally believe he thinks that because he knows he makes a majority of the mess, so he realises it would still be him doing the work. Who do you believe is in the wrong?
