My friend is buying me a laptop, I donâ€™t have any money to buy them anything Recently Iâ€™ve been having a lot of trouble with my laptop, it often takes 10-15 minutes just to start up and is slow when it comes to doing homework. My friend told me a few days ago that theyâ€™re getting me a new laptop, to top it off itâ€™s a gaming one too able to run games I could never play that well before (Even Minecraft ran slow) As you could imagine, because of the virus money is tight and even if I did have some it would be very mediocre to the laptop they are getting me.

For context there is a very big wealth difference between me and my but that has never challenged our relationship. The best I can offer them is my drawings of digital art but even they donâ€™t feel like enough. I really donâ€™t deserve their generosity and I donâ€™t know how to give them a gift of equal thought/appreciation let alone how to thank them for everything theyâ€™ve done for me.

Iâ€™m in binds about this, I have little to nothing to give them and I donâ€™t know how to show them how much they mean to me too.
