Could anyone give me tips on improving my physique ? Hello, for context, i'm 14 and i'm 49,9kg (110 pounds for the non-eu people) and that means i'm underweight compared to people of my age.  

I've wanted to gain some muscles because I sure do lack some but there are 3 things that make things more difficult for me: I'm too shy to ask my mother to buy me some simple material to workout, I'm underweight and with covid all sport centers and activites like soccer and handball are closed. So let me get straight to the point, what are things that can help me gain muscle and help me with my weight problem ? ( I have less muscles in my upper body part than my lower part btw).

Any tips are welcomed ! :)
