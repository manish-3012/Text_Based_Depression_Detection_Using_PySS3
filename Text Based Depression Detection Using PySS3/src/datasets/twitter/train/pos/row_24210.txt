gEt A jOb, YoUr'E 16 ~my parents Sure. No friggin problem. I understand the point mom that it will give me some real world experience and help me down the road, and it will give me some independence...but how am i supposed to keep a job when first of all, im not even mature enough to keep a job. Im trying to figure out this whole "good decision making" and "you shouldnt procrastanate thing" and how to handle my anxiety levels when it comes to dealing with both. Ive struggled for years with these problems and you have made very helpful suggestions and have given me a therapist to talk to (in the past) to dealing with these problems, but im still struggling. Now your strategy is to yell at me and threaten me to fix it and to get a job. I still dont have a way to get there because i dont have a car and you are too busy to even think about taking me to a job, nor even sit down with me to come up with a strategy to make my life easier. You know i have ADHD, and you and me both know that it keeps me from being a better teen, but you forget that fact more often then i forget to vacumn the living room. Yelling about going to school and getting good grades so i can go to college and applying for scholarships only makes me more anxious along with trying to get a job when i dont even really know how to exactly live with myself yet (independence wise)

Yes i need to grow up, but i need help. Im not you when you were my age. Very similar, but not the same. Wise up
