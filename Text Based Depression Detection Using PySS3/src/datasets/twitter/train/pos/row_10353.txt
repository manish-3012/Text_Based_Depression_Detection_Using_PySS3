A little thank you for u/ummwack I'm 100% sure you are going to read this, so here we go

I just want to thank you so much for being such an amazing friend to me. You have helped me so much and stayed with me in my darkest moments. Even though you have your own troubles in life, you are still there for me when I need you, I appreciate that so much. I sometimes worry that I don't make everything more difficult, but you always get mad when I start about that. I can trust you with everything, you always listen to me and you respect my opinions. 

We had our ups and downs but we always manage to stay strong and get on top of it. I couldn't have wished for a better friend to have in life really. I genuinely hope we can continue this up, I mean everytime we talk you make me smile even if I had a harsh day. Back when we met I was in such a dark place and I had such a shitty past, however you helped me to accept what has happened back then and you helped me with a better vision of the world. Thanks to you I am able to deal with everything better and I don't have to hold everything in anymore.

I don't believe in God like you know but I honestly feel blessed to have you as a friend of mine and I can't put into words how much you mean to me. Thank you for everything you have done for me, they mean much to me you have no idea
