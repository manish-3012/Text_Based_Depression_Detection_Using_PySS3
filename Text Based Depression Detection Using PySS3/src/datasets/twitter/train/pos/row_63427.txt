A situation I guess So Iâ€™ve got into a situation with my friend group where one of them god angry at me for pretty much no reason and attacked me so I defended myself and punched him and he bled a lot. So now one of my other friends is pissed at me and has said that he wants to fight me and idk if i should do it or not. Iâ€™m 5â€™6 and heâ€™s a little taller and a little stronger than me cos Iâ€™ve arm wrestled him before. But I have 3 years of judo training, some boxing training and some general knowledge about fighting. Should I say yes?
