I get so goddamn happy every time my history teacher plays moonlight sonata in class Not because it keeps me engaged, but because it shows some Gamer memories of me playing Bayonetta and Earthworm Jim 2. not only were those two my favorite games, but they also have real special memories attached to it and actually distract me from history class lol.
