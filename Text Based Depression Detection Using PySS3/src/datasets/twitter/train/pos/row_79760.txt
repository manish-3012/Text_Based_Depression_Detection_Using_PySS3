i feel so pent up and aversive to emotional vulnerability for no reason typically iâ€™d consider myself a general independent and open person, but lately iâ€™ve felt so off. in terms of my mood, iâ€™ve been perfectly fine, but i just feel an intense yearning for someone to understand and validate me. i currently have no one who iâ€™m super close to, and i havenâ€™t felt comfortable opening up emotionally to any of my friends for some reason. like, i get so insecure and scared of the way people will end up perceiving me and i find itâ€™d be better to avoid embarrassing myself i guess. i really donâ€™t know how to deal with all this. i vent to myself a lot in a personal google doc diary thing, and i try to channel my feelings into art (itâ€™s so fucking hard, i canâ€™t figure it out), but i still have that longing for more; real connection and shit
