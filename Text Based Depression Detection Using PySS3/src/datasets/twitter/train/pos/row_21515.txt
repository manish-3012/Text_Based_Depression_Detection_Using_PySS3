Relationship Entry 15 This is the 15th entry in the series. And this one is gonna be short. And... not really sweet just kinda bland.

Well the gig is up, my girlfriend now know these exist. I was gonna save it for an anniversary present but due to... Not so good reasons, I showed her the posts. Now is it technically illegal for me to post her life with me on the internet... Naahhhhhh, there's nothing wrong with it. Also she's probably looking at this now, so hallo, I love you! Oh and now we're currently fake celebrating our 1 year anniversary.

The life lesson for this one is, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade, it's sour and isn't even that good, just go get sweet tea like a Chad.
