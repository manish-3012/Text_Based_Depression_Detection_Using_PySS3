I almost died today I had a dentist appointment today, and for breakfast I made myself a boiled egg (big mistake)

I went there and they needed to inject anesthesia into my gums (they injected me around 5 times)

They did what they did and told me to get up

I got up and everything everything got black except a little slither I could see through (I don't remember really, but I think it was like that)

They asked me if I was okay and I said, "yeah, but everything is getting black"

My dentist grabbed me and fucking threw me on the chair and started slapping the fuck out of me, and spraying water in my face. The other dentist asked me if could hear her and asked me to say something

After they did that they asked me to get up next to a window 

I did that and everything started getting black and the same thing happened again, but they made me smell Ammonia (also fun fact, I remember thinking i didn't get up and that it was a fake memory cause i blacked out)

After I felt better they made me eat chocolate and asked me what I ate and told me to never go to the dentist eating this little 

They placed me on another chair, I sat there trying not to cry. 

Then they moved me to the waiting room and made me color in a Spongebob drawing book (which was pretty funny) and a person was in the room with me 

And then my dad came to pick me up
