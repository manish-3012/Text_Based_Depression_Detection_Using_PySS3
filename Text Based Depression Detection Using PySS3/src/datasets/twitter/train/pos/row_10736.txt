You know itâ€™s kinda weird to think about how unique of a generation we are. I mean weâ€™re the most depressed generation and the most anxious. Itâ€™s hard to Imagine that just 2 generations ago these levels of depression and anxiety werenâ€™t there. I canâ€™t imagine anything different then what we have now though.


(American)


Another unique attribute to our generation is that we are the first generation to be born after the fall of America in terms of America being a hyper power. Some would argue that the millennials were born after the the U.S. lost itâ€™s hyper power status but Iâ€™d disagree and thatâ€™s fine, Iâ€™m here to argue that.  


(World)


This generation is the first generation to be born without knowing a world without the internet. For better or worse this is true. Alongside that we are the only the second generation that will have to â€œsave the worldâ€ from climate change. I put that in quotes because it sounded very cartoony. Climate change will most likely show its deadliest side during our lifetimes but probably not during our parentsâ€™s or grandparents. This to me makes us and the millennials unique, for we are (I could be wrong) the first generations born with the burden of living through a climate dystopia, or having to work our ass of to save ourselves from such a dystopia.


Sorry for long text post but it was just some thing Iâ€™ve been thinking about and wanting to share.
