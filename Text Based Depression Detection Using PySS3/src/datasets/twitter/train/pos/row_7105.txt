Looking for new music? I have spent the past two years digging through 17,000 songs that were posted to reddit by independent musicians. Whenever I ran into one that blew me away, I added it to this archive! The songs are organized by genre and platform. There are over 1K songs and over 90 genres! You can view the [full archive here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5mBFelk81ghWre0_yc2fbhE4ZztmIj-Enim_8Dium8/edit). This database is focused on the Spotify platform, but it includes songs that weren't available on Spotify as well. Each song is color coded by its platform. Green for Spotify,  yellow for Soundcloud, and red for YouTube. If you'd rather just dive into a playlist that contains all of the music, [you can listen on Spotify here.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1q8wRIhriTOBWbi81cPujs?si=yLwuccplTUmOJ5RMxHyLhg)
