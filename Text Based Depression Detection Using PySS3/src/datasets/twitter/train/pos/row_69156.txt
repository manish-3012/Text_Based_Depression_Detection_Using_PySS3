I have a date tomorrow! I posted here a while ago because I ad a problem with confessing to my crush even though they felt the same way. I sent a message saying I liked them and they asked me out (and of course I said yes, Iâ€™d be crazy not to).

Iâ€™m super excited and am having trouble falling asleep but itâ€™s finally happening!!

And to whomever is reading this, have a nice morning, day, or night!
