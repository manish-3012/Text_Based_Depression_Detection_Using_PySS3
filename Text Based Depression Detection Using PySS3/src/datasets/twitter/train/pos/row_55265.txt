My girlfriend is a burrito This is a short one but I like it

About two days ago I was with my girlfriend hanging out in her room while she did homework, pretty normal. But every time she started talking to me she would get distracted and stop doing her work, so eventually we were just talking. She was talking about how tired she was due to volleyball and a generally just bad sleep schedule, until she walked over to me and we laid down together for like half an  hour cuz I had to leave. I looked at her and she was asleep (because of course she was), but I had to leave so I got up, grabbed her blanket from off the ground, and tucked her in real quick before i had to leave. As i was tucking in the blanket she said "I'm a burrito" and that was 100% the best part of my day.
