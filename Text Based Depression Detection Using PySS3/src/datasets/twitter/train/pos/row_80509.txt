Parents please have faith in your kids Damn this the most irritating thing. I understand parents are worried about their kids and everything, but please believe in your kids and be optimistic about what they can achieve. Lots of seniors and their parents are super stressed over college, including mine, and they let their minds get killed over something that hasnâ€™t even happened yet. My mom is acting like the past 2 years of work and research weâ€™ve put towards college are worthless because I havenâ€™t been accepted to any T20 schools, yet none of these T20 schools Iâ€™ve applied to released their regular decision acceptances yet (And I just got accepted into a T50, so obviously the work paid off.) Please be worried about your kids, but not to the point that youâ€™re regretful about past decisions that have influenced events that havenâ€™t happened yet!
