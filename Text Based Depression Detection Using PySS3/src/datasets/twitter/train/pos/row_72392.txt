Dear my 600lbs gym teacher, donâ€™t tell me that my 10 minute mile is too slow. These absolute whales of gym teachers be like â€œHOW DARE YOU TAKE MORE THAN 7 MINUTES TO RUN THE MILE YOU NEED TO BE IN SHAPE!â€ 

Like bitch please you should be running not me, lay off the pizza rolls and cake we see you eating in the gym office
