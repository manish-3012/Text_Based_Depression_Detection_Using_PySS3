needing some help, i canâ€™t live with my mom anymore. my dad has custody of me, but kicked me out and now im living with my mom. my dad now wants me to move back in, and i want to. i miss my dog and siblings, my room here is tiny while i had the basement at my dadâ€™s, and my mom is kind of unbearable. how do i bring up to my mom that i want to move back in with my dad? i want want to make her angry or upset. when we had an argument a few months back that practically resulted in her banning me from having friends, i cried that i wanted to move back into my dadâ€™s house. she straight up said â€œno. youâ€™re notâ€. i also donâ€™t want her stealing my things if i do move. if i just have my sister pick me up and call saying iâ€™m staying, sheâ€™d surely steal my television, record player, minifridge, etc. (anything i couldnâ€™t carry in a backpack) even though i bought or was gifted all of them. i donâ€™t know what to do. 

thanks for any replies.
