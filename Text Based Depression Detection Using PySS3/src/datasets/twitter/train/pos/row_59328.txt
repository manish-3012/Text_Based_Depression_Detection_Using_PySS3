UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH So I was walking out of my room to go grab my phone, and my wall and doorways have those, like, wood fixture things on the bottom, and again, just walking, I hit my pinky toe, SUPER HARD. IT STILL HURTS. Anyways, pretty sure its either sprained or broken, cuz it hurts and feels weird when I try to move, it, and I'll tell my dad tomorrow. So... How was y'all's day?
