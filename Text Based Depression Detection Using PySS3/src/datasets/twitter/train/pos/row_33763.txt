Please help me. Today I had a breakdown for the first time in a while.

Sharing this because I just need to let it all out. I have anxiety and depression, but I usually bottle up my emotions. But today we just got news that my area is going into another lockdown, and I guess I just burst into tears. Iâ€™m always so lonely and now I canâ€™t see my one friend. I have no one to share my interests with and it all just hit me like a truck. I cried for about 20 minutes, and now I have a headache. I really need a hug.
