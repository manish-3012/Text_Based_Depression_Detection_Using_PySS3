How TF do you guys do it? I live in Australia and we just got an American teacher for advanced maths. How tf do any of u guys even pass maths. she dead ass can't explain shit. like we were doing quadratic functions and she just kept saying it was a two-part process but only showed us the second step for like an hour, then realised she wrote something wrong and re-did the whole fucking explanation. jesus i feel for u guys in the us. sorry for the formatting i just dont want to format it
