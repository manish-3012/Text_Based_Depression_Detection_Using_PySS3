I'm at my breaking point. Since sixth grade, I've suffered from depression. It's insanely taxing and some days I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed.

I'm in tenth grade now. I've recently realized that I'm trans and pan, and it hasn't made things any better.

I just blew up at my PE teacher because I don't give two shits about PE. He keeps using the argument that you need PE credits to pass high school and I somehow managed to contain the urge to tell him that I may take my own life before high school ends.

I can't take this anymore. The stress is killing me. I'm judged by everyone for everything. I hate myself and I hate my life. I'm too scared to talk to my counselor because if I do I'll end up in the hospital again. My parents are going to think I'm an actual dissappointment, if they don't already.

I might kill myself today. I might. I don't know how but I'll find a way.

Someone help me. Please.
