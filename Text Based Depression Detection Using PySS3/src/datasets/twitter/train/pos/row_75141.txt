I like to write queer stuff on random objects while on walks sometimes. I write stuff like "trans rights!" or "gender isn't binary" to let people know that trans people do indeed exist in the southern U.S. and we're going to let it be known. I'm only able to write this stuff in pencil so it's not very visible but I still like doing it. Of course it's probably more legal to do it in pencil.
