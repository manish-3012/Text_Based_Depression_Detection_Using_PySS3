dread for something i should be excited about? ok so basically i got asked out on a date by a guy i donâ€™t know too well yet . I think heâ€™s hot and he seems like a really nice guy- BUT every time i think about meeting him at the date i literally like cringe and dread it so much, is there something wrong with me or what does this mean??
