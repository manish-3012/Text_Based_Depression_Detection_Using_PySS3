Bruh the fuck I just saw a news article that said that they are going to remove the word "negeren" (wich mean ignoring) from the dutch language because it has the word "neger" in it Wich is the n-word but in dutch, like the word has nothing to do with skin color and removing it from the dictionary is pointless because everyone already used the word and nobody is going to stop using it (or atleast I highly doubt it) because it's just a fucking word that means ignoring and I don't know any synonyms and there is literally nothing racist about it
