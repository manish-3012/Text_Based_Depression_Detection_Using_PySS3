"Oh but teachers have so much more students to teach all on different levels!" Yes of course but they do not have to switch from Spanisch to Sports to Math to French in a matter of just a few hours to provide an in depth look at the subject required for daily assignments. Yes teachers also struggle, some way more than they should but that doesn't mean you can discount my struggles.
