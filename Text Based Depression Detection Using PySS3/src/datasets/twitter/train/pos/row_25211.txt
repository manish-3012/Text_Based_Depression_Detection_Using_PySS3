In a new school as a senior. First post here so idk if the advice flair is correctly used but I need advice.
So since 3rd grade I had been homeschooled. In recent years I started to hate it because of the lack of structure and feeling of isolation. For my senior year I wanted to go to a public school. This is the 3rd week, and still have yet to really talk to anybody. no clubs that I know of have opened up because of covid, no group projects because of covid, we can only use every 5th seat at lunch, my friends that I know aren't in any of my classes, and the few people I knew already, I don't get a chance to talk to because our names are on opposite sides of the alphabet. What's the best way I could start talking to people?
