How do ppl even get crushes Like seriously, Iâ€™ve never had a crush on anyone my age before, Iâ€™m a lesbian and Iâ€™ve only had celebrity crushes on girls who were way older than I am???

I see posts all the time with people saying they like someone and all I wonder is how? 
Everyone at my school is so weird, theyâ€™re really dumb, obnoxious, and really just people I am not into.
My mom always gives me crap for not wanting to date people from my school, she thinks I need relationship â€œpracticeâ€ 
All Iâ€™ve noticed from people who date at my age get into relationships, get out after 2 weeks, and go date someone new, itâ€™s an infinite loop and doesnâ€™t ever teach anyone anything. 

Its infuriating to me, Iâ€™m in the 9th grade and never had to deal with that crush stuff. I feel left out tbh
Iâ€™ve dealt with ppl having crushes on me but Iâ€™ve never had a thing for them back, I mean most of them are boys so I wouldnâ€™t like them anyways but I still feel almost guilty for not liking any of them back. 

So honestly, how do you get crushes?
