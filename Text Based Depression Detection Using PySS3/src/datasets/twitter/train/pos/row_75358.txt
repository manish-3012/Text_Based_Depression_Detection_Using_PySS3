Ffs I hate awkwardness... Was wearing my earphones in bed jamming to my Spotify list so hard that I completely forgot my surroundings then my dad came in (he doesn't know English so he has completely no idea what I'm listening to) and he was like wtf....

Might be the most awkward thing that happened to me this year.
