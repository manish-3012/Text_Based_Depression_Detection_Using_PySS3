Things have been goin well recently for me and I donâ€™t know why Things really keep going well for me and it doesnâ€™t feel real. A lot of things in my life have really been going well recently, this isnâ€™t me flexing itâ€™s the opposite. As much as I am happy that things are going well, I feel like I should be happier. Itâ€™s like I havenâ€™t processed it all and still feel kinda bad, and like I donâ€™t deserve it. At the same time it just doesnâ€™t feel real? Idk itâ€™s hard to explain. Itâ€™s such a strange mood and hard to explain, anyways thatâ€™s the end of my mini rant
