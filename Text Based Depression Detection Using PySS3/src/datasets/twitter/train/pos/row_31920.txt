That's it, I am freaking done. My government wants to introduce a law to stop console/GPU scalpers.


I definitely do not support scalpers or what they do and I would never buy from them but still...


Out of all the things you could be doing (ie fixing the freaking country) the MPs are trying to make laws so GPUs and game consoles can be purchased easier because they were mad they weren't able to get one for their kids


It would be nice if scalpers were gone but how about FIX THE MESS YOU HAVE PUT THE WHOLE FREAKING UNITED KINGDOM IN FIRST
