No puede hacer tanto CALOOOOOR I'm in Spanish class and I'm bored so I'm putting some lyrics of 3 different songs guess 1 of them and you will get it.

1.I cannot trust you easily

Or think that I'm the only one

I never let people in

And I have you to remind me why


2.A centerfold miracle, lyrical

You saved my life again

And I want you to know, baby


3.(And say goodbye) To the life you make

   (And say goodbye) To the heart you break

    And all the cyanide you drank
