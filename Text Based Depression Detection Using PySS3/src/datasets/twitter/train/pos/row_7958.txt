If 2020 were a person I would have killed it by now. Fuck you 2020. First you bring the virus. Then you fucking kill 3 members of my family. It took my grand pa and his father 2 days apart last month. 2 FUCKING DAYS! My Grandpa was literally a father to me. I would see him every day of my life. I wasnt even able yo say goodby to him. I miss him so much. Im still depressed after that but now? 2020 decides to take my fucking pet. My turtle of 4 fucking years. I dont know what to do now. Im really upset what this year as come up to. It has taken so much from me. I can barely type anymore. Tears are in my eyes. I just need a break for once.
