How is it right now in the USA? As someone who lives outside of the United States, the only thing that I am able to see right now is political stuff and virus stuff (and a bit of BLM stuff). But I want to know what it's REALLY like in the US right now, not just the big stuff the news wants to report on. If you are American, please share how things are going for you.
