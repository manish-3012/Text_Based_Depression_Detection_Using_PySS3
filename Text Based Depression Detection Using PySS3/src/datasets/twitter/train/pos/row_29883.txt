you guys ever seen that PETA ad of a dog and a pig and it's like "they're just as intelligent, so why would you eat one but not the other"

Honestly, it just made me realize that eating dog is no worse than eating pig so now I feel nothing weird about eating dog meat

it had the opposite of the intended effect
