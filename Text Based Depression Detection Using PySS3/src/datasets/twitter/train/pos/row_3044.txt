Do yall parents do the same? So it's history from today. My little brother have common cold And he stays home because my parents says so. When I breath my chest hurt, when I'm eating something my throat hurts, And my head hurts af and I'm going to school cuz my mom â€žgave me pills" (which don't do any fucking thing). U know what? My school when any teacher see you ill in school (especially during fucking pandemic) call your parents to go and take u home and she is gonna be angry at me cuz she sent me ill to school.
