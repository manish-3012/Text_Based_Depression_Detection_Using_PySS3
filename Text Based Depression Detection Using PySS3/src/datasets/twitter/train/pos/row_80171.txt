why are all my siblings prodigies and Iâ€™m just stupid I have 4 sisters: 2 are studying applied mathematics at Harvard, 1 is studying physics at U of Chicago, and one is in med school at NYU. 

I just finished smoking my 2nd joint. I have a 2.1 gpa and am failing 2 of my classes. I am definitely not the favorite child.
