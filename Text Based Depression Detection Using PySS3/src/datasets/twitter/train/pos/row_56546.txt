Among Us is a bad game. Everytime i get into a game theres either a hacker or people teaming. The game isnt even fun and the developers dont even care. And anyone can get hacks easy its not like theres a secret. Its turned into a Gta Online PC lobby where everyone is toxic. Why does no one talk about how bad this game is? The game developers need to fix the hacking issue Its to the point where i can ONLY play when i have friends on because if i try to get into a random game, like i said theres either a hacker or teamates.
