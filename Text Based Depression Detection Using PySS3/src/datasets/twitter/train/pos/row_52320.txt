I'm in a bad mood because I want to be friends with a TikToker but I don't want to come off as a creepy incel or harass her about it. What am I supposed to do about this? She does a few livestreams every now and then. I think,like once a week. And I'm pretty much the only one in her chats so it's almost like texting her. That and I'm incredibly lonely. Every time I try to comment on her vids I end up breaking down because I'm scared if she doesn't want to be friends. She's a lesbian,so I'm trying not to come off as a romantic. Plus she's taken. What if she wants to block me? I'm eagerly waiting for her next stream to ask her about this but I don't know if that's gonna work. I asked her on her Q&amp;As and deleted the questions each and every time. I just want to be friends with her,nothing more than that. I never asked for this but it's the only thing that could make me happy. I think it stemmed from me not being able to talk to my real friends because of quarantine and stuff. I commented on her vids but didn't want others to see it. I am truly lost. Should I just get over it or go for it? She's 17/18 and I'm 15. She claims to have had bad experiences in school and was a target for bullying and rumors,so she probably doesn't want to talk to me. Her fanbase is surprisingly small,despite what her follower count and like count would tell you,and that's why I feel like her and I could get along as pen pals or something. If it was someone as big as Charli D'Amelio,I would definitely try to get over it as she clearly wouldn't notice me. She is open about what region she lives in,so I fantasize about actually meeting her in person,though I feel like that would be a miracle,in any sense of the word you like. I posted this here because I feel like you guys on r/teenagers understand better than r/askReddit would. I hope this doesn't come off as creepy.
