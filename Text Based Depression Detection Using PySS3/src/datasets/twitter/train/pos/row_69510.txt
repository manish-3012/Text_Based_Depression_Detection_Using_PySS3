I found it guys, but I need your help! Over the past years, I would eat a lot of sugar and tell myself: â€œyou idiot go on a diet.â€ And that would last a few days until I found sugar again and ruin myself. This is a cycle that repeats and repeats. I need your help guys. How can I break this cycle and become a better person?

Also itâ€™s not just this, wouldnâ€™t mind going off reddit for a few days.
