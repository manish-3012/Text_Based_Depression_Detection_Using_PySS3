in a situation weebs have probably been in i made a post about not feeling anything for real life girls, except anime "waifus".

I have come across a certain "waifu" that is somehow different from the others. 

For some reason, I can't get over the fact that she isn't real. I had no problem with the others, but somehow I'm more attracted to her than the others, I want to know more about her, go on dates, etc. No lewd intentions, just "care".

Any tips, if you have any?(for embracing reality)
