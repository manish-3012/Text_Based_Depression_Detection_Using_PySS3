Welcome to the opposite/upside down world! An opposite/upside down world is where: your dog walks you, your car drives you, your tv turns you on, your shampoos shower themselves with your blood, the vacuum makes you suck everything, your phone touches you, your blankets cover themselves using you, you give your teacher homework, you bully people older than you, you teach your dad how to be driven by your car, you give birth to your parents, you spank your parents, you find studying more fun than gaming, you think mobile gaming is better than pc gaming, your food eats you, your gf has to ask you out and pay for the food, your parents need permission from you to hang out with their friends, floors walk on you, your clothes and shoes where you, you tell your mom to do the dishes, your phone is addicted to you, you sacrifice your life to erasers' mistakes, you tell your teachers "how was your weekend?", snowmen build you, your newborn babies drink alcohol and you drink their milk, etc...
