Getting a girlfriend wonâ€™t magically fix your depression btw I donâ€™t know who needs to hear this but I wish someone told me this earlier. 

If we rewind like 10 months ago, I was: clinically depressed, missing a shit ton of school because of it and and battling suicidal ideation. Itâ€™s been much more easier to deal with thankfully and Iâ€™ve been doing better until recently. 

I remember when my serotonin-lacking brain would tell me Iâ€™m a piece of shit and that no one would ever love me. Well, 3 months ago I started talking to someone and we started dating officially in August. Sheâ€™s an amazing human being and Iâ€™ve never been more grateful to have someone in my love who loves and appreciates me the way she does.

And yet, the thoughts are coming back? And itâ€™s painful as hell and thankfully I have a good support network around me. It made me realise however that the things I that once thought would save me from these shitty thoughts ( e.g a loving relationship, kind friends, good grades ) arenâ€™t doing that. 

Depression and other mental illnesses donâ€™t have a clear cut solution to them. Itâ€™s okay to not be okay. Remember to take care of yourselves and realise that the things you want may not be the things to keep the negative thoughts at bay. Maintenance is better than quick fixes.

TL;DR. I still feel shitty even after getting a gf, and thatâ€™s okay!
