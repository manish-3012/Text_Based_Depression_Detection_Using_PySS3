Somebody thinks im hot So I'm on the band bus headed to a football game and my friend uses the female snapchat filter on me. He then shows it to the (mature) chill percussionist and he's like, "Dang dude, you're hot! Like seriously hot" and im pretty sure I heard him say, "I'd tap that" under his breath but im not sure cuz the bus was loud
