Hey, you dropped an apostrophe! I hope you all realize how serious this is. I have been scrolling through social media today and have, to my utter horror, noticed that not just a handful of people, but *every single person* has written â€˜Halloweâ€™enâ€™ without the apostrophe. It seems that people have forgotten that â€˜Halloweâ€™enâ€™ is an abbreviation nowadays. Disgraceful...

Thatâ€™s all I had to say.

Have a pleasant day and try not to eat too much candy.
