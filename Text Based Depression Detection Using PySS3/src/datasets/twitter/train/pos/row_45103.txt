Iâ€™ve been in this sub for a while, and I dont think Iâ€™ve ever posted because Iâ€™m a boring human being, but Iâ€™m turning 20 next month, so I might as well do it while I can... Hey. Life can be rough sometimes, but never forget to look on the bright side. Youâ€™re here, arenâ€™t you? Things could always be worse. Thereâ€™s always gonna be someone out there who has your back, and if thereâ€™s not, well thereâ€™s billions of people out there who could be willing to. Youâ€™re alive, you clearly have internet access so things canâ€™t be that awful. If you donâ€™t have a significant other yet, hey! Weâ€™re young! Thereâ€™s always time, and, like I said, plenty of people willing to hop on board! Everyoneâ€™s got their something, thereâ€™s no exceptions. Youâ€™re funny, or youâ€™re smart, or youâ€™re cool, or youâ€™re kind, or something. This year hasnâ€™t been the best, but i have faith in our generation that things will be okay in the future, and I think you should, too. Btw, online classes suck, right? Iâ€™m not learning a damn thing all jokes and wholesomeness aside itâ€™s actually impossible lmao


Okay, that is all, thank you whoever takes the time to read this, and have a day as great as yourself!
