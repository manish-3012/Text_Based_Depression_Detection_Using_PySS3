i found an website/app that donates food to people that need it for you answering super easy questions [https://freerice.com/categories/english-vocabulary](https://freerice.com/categories/english-vocabulary)

it donates 10 rice to the needing for each answered question, i calculated that you need to answer 480 questions to feed one kid

if the 42.5k people online right now answer 10 questions we will feed  885.4 kids for a day

&amp;#x200B;

lets fucking do it then what are you waiting for
