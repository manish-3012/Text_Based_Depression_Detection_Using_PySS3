I am officially depression and anxiety free!!! So... I am 16 and I was at my psychiatrist session today and it's been a while since I am happy and ok with my life, so today I've been told I am free of my depression and my anxiety and that's beautiful and I'm super happy and decided to post, even tho no one is gonna see it, it's my small achievement. I'm proud of myself â™¡
