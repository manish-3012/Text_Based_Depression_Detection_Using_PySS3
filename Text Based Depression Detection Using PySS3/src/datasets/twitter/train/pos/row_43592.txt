My mother, father and grandfather have tested positive for covid - 19 My whole house is in a state of turmoil. 
I don't know what to do anymore. I'm mainly worried about my father (52) who is diabetic and also had bypass surgery 2 years ago . The risk is very high for him . He is being shifted to a hospital. I just needed to vent this.  To everyone who sees this , stay safe and trust me , it's very dangerous out there . 
My mom and dad are doctors and still they have to deal with this . The threat is real and closer than you think . Take care everyone.
