For high school this year I have to start a personal project about something Iâ€™m passionate about as it counts towards my grade and Iâ€™ve decided that I want to create a mental health support group But I just feel like Iâ€™m incapable of being able to help others when Iâ€™m struggling to help myself right now. I am actively cutting myself on my arm, I have a mental breakdown just about everyday and Iâ€™m struggling with body insecurities and Iâ€™m vomiting every other day. Is there anything I can do to take on leadership for this new group I want to make without it taking a toll on me?
