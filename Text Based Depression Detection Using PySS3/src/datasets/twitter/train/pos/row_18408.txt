Does my friend like me? Hellos, I am a confused boy trying to figure out what if my friend likes me or is just trying to be a cool Friend. 

So ever since school started back in Late August, I've noticed that one of my friends has been more kind than usual. Like she defends me from the rest of the group when they're "picking" on me. We're also like playful with one another. What I mean by that is casual poking at one another, pressing the mute or Off button on our Laptops, and constantly making jokes and not paying attention to class. I know there's more but I can't remember them at the top of my head.

 And from my side, I just enjoy being around with her and making her happy. I can't speak for what she thinks though, but what I think is that she just thinks I'm a great friend. She even gave me a muffin today, and she doesn't usually do that. I personally think it's all just human decency.
