I need help being friends or smth with this girl Follow up to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8jpch/i_met_this_girl/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
So she is taken.. I encouraged myself to ask her if she has a boyfriend and she told me that she does. And since then we weren't texting. 

I don't wanna try ruin everything for her. I just wanna be friends with her as I like her personality. But I have no clue how to go on.

I mean she has a bf. What could I do? I still think she gave me hints but I'm not 100% sure bout that. 

We sat next to each other in driving school and she kinda stared at me when I wasn't looking. I then asked her for her Snapchat and I got it. She smiled the whole time when we were talking etc. 

Next day (yesterday) we were learning how to drive a moped and whatever. Some things happened. The teacher and I were in a office bc I don't have my own helmet yet and I could borrow one. And then she came in and we smiled at each other. 

So when we were making ready for driving she asked me to help her with putting on her gloves.
Like that I thought was obviously a hint.

Then after i was standing there and she was sitting on a chair and she zoomed in to my face and took a picture on snapchat. Then even after when i was sitting next to her she took another picture and we laughed and everything. 

I don't wanna lose her.. I feel something like this for the first time man.

What should I do. I wanna be together with her but don't really wanna ruin her relationship. She even said she was together with the best guy. So that was a hint in the other direction
