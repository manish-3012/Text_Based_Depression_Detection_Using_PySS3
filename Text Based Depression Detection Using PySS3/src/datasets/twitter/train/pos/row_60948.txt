I just realized my friend asked me out and I thought he was joking and I brushed it off So I knew this guy since 2nd grade and we've been friends ever since, people would jokingly call him my stalker and I'd just laugh it off. In like 7th grade he started acting weird around me and I just took it as puberty and kept with our friendship. 

One day in 8th my friend and I got into an argument and I was super pissed off, and he comes up to me with his friend who've I've had a crush on since 3rd. He asks me if I wanted to go out with him. Now there was nothing that would implicate that he was joking, he was fidgeting, looking down and mumbling, but I was just not in the mood that day. I was a total bitch and scoffed, rolled my eyes and no, then got up and moved to another table. I don't know why I acted so mean. Was it really because i was pissed at my friend, or did I not want my crush to get the wrong idea? Was I really willing to hurt my friend over that? 

He stopped talking to me a little bit after that. I didn't really notice how much he avoided me because we didn't share any classes in the first semester, but in the second we had math together. He sat on the opposite end of another table, so we would face each other. For the first few weeks I tried to wave and say hi but he always acted like he couldn't hear. I wondered why and stopped. 

Just now I connected the dots. I feel terrible, but how does he feel? Even worse. I want to apologize but we haven't talked in such a long time. We were good friends and a single question ruined all of that. Sorry for the long rant but I wanted to post it somewhere. I'll think more before I speak next time
