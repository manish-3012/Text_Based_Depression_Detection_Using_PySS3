Yâ€™allâ€™s understand of tic tok is toxic This is going to be long

So, I see a lot of people around here hating on tic tok. Which is fair but I would say they are most definitely hating it for the wrong reasons. 

The biggest thing if seen is that girls are posting soft core porn on it because they twerk a little to a song. Idk when the word changed meaning but considering the fact that theyâ€™re 1. Still dressed and 2. Itâ€™s a simple dance. Twerking is not soft core porn. 

And why hate on the female aspect of the app? Theyâ€™re just having fun. They shake their butt a little, who cares? Why is them exuding confidence in their body and self an issue for you? And all the weird people who contact them are weird to them too. And even if theyâ€™re not thatâ€™s ok because they should have the ability to explore life themselves and as long as theyâ€™re doing it confidently and safely, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s an issue. 

The biggest problem with tic tok I would say is the lack of creativity and the obsession the algorithm has with people of privilege(upper class, generally white). I canâ€™t tell you how many guys I have seen on tic tok putting a stupid chain in their mouth without a shirt on trying to look â€œhotâ€ on camera or something. The girls who do the same dumb dance to the same song but in a different area. Or the people who try to do bits but donâ€™t know what timing is or what a punch line is. Or the people who literally just show off their parentsâ€™ amazing house and still get thousands of likes and stuff. 

Tic tok is dumb. Itâ€™s community is full of repetition and privilege. But itâ€™s stupid to dog on women just because they like to shake their ass.
