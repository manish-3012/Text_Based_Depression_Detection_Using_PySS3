is it bad that Iâ€™m not going to school? my grades are dropping. I havenâ€™t been to school. 

Iâ€™m not the type to get â€œanxiousâ€ or whatever you call this, but recently when Iâ€™ve showed up to school Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™ve lost control of my body. I feel sad and mad. Really nervous, and I start to feel nauseous or lightheaded. I donâ€™t have any friends because we are doing a hybrid schedule. All my friends are on the other day. I tried to make new friends, but was unsuccessful. I mean, we are a semester and a half into the year, everyone has already made their friends. 

Is it bad that Iâ€™ve been staying home? I have just lost all motivation to show up. My teachers ignore me when Iâ€™m there. The kids ignore me or make fun of me. I hate it there. Iâ€™m on the wrestling team at my school, and I love those guys so much, but I donâ€™t feel confident enough to ask them to hangout outside of wrestling. Itâ€™s like everyone is super tight when we wrestle, and outside of wrestling everyone has a life. My life outside of wrestling is going to the gym and doing martial arts with old 30 year old ppl lol. Iâ€™ve never been in touch with my peers and Iâ€™m not sure what to do.
