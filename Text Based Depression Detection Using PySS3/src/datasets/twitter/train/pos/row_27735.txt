wish i could go back i remember it like yesterday i was 10 years old happy as can be. my dad said he was leaving as he always would in search of a quick job and money that day like he always did. i hugged him and said goodbye not knowing what was to come. arrested for robbery sentenced to 2 years. a year and a half go bye me still caring of course. btw my dad is an immigrant. they decide to send him back to his country. he calls me while he is being set to be deported saying that he will come back as he did twice before by hopping the train and crossing the river. still hope. days later i come back from playing soccer with my friends. my mom tells me she has to tell me something important. i thought to myself what could it be. she tells me while my dad was in the process of being deported his dna had been linked to a double rape case back in early 2017. to make things even worser these were children. i didnt know what to think. i couldnt believe it. he is never getting out. 4 years later im an asshole all i do is sleep all day the other day i took a lot of robitussin for no reason i have bad social anxiety i have bad anger issues like my dad i never go outside i overeat thanks for the high metabolism though my grades arent good enough im always tired and mentally stressed my eyes are always red and look bad i have adhd i never really talk to my friends i just play videogames with strangers all day and surf reddit and i wonder how can i ever be happy again without being fake (my dad still awaits trial but i already know he's never getting out the last time i talked to him was 6 months ago and till this day he still denies everything so now i ignore him didnt answer him on christmas nor my birthday.)
