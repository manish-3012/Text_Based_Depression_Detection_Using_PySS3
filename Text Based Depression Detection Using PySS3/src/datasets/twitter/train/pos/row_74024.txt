I'm not racist because I have a Blue Lives Matter flag patch in my room. I understand this post will be very controversial, but I need to put it out because I'm tired of me and other people getting judged for this.

I went to a local air show two years ago, and I got two US flag patches, one with a red stripe (for firefighters) and one with a blue stripe (for cops). I didn't have any clothing I could put the patches on, so I just kept it in my room for display. I didn't toss them into a junk drawer because one of my dad's friends is a firefighter and I know some friends parents who are cops. 

When the whole George Floyd protests started up, I briefly reconsidered displaying the patches. But, I keep them up, as of March 2021. I've got a lot of respect for our first responders, and just because some bad cops unfairly treated an unarmed black man doesn't mean all cops are bastards, or whatever. Yes, there are some bad cops. But there's a lot of good cops out there for sure.

Now, why am I posting this now instead of during the prime of the protests in 2020? Well, I got criticized for it. I was in an R6 lobby today with random players, and a guy said blue lives matter when talking about Clash. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not, but I agreed and it slipped out. "Yeah, Blue Lives Matter!" Immediately, the other three on our team turned on us, giving us hate for supporting "those bastard cops". I heard the word "boot" in the mess, so to avoid getting booted and getting in trouble with my parents, I left. Yeah I dropped to Silver V, but whatever.

Blue Lives Matter.
