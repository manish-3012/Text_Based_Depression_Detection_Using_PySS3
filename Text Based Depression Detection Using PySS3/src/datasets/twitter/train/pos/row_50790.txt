Hey guys looking for advice Iâ€™ve been kind of low lately. I donâ€™t want to keep in this direction but I havenâ€™t found much good recently. You donâ€™t have to worry about me or anything this isnâ€™t my â€œnoteâ€. But I guess Iâ€™m looking for ways I can be happy. If any of you have been where I am please lend some knowledge. Thanks guys &lt;3
