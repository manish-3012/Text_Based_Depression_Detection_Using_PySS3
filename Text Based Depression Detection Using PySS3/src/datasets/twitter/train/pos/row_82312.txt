I love PC gaming and the community behind it. Like they rly can just take a Nintendo game that was like 480p on consoles and then make it run on an emulator but in 4k and then with better performance and visuals than the original. Like just a single dude can run off thousands in donations and make a 100 billion dollar company's game way better. And there's so many people who can do that it's crazy.
