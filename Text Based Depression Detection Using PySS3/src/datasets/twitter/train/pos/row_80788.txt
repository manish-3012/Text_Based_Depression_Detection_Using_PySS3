How did this work out SO basically my teachers don't take attendence, but if you get called on or don't leave fast enough they know you are not there. So Spanish was boring one day, so I was off my computer broowing reddit. Then suddenly i was like *holy shit what time is it is spanish done*(we have 85 minute periods) so I rush back to my computer and was like oh thank god not done yet, shes wrapping up. Then she ends it so i go to my next period. However, it was at 87 mminutes? what the hell happened, and how did i not get cught?
