Parents of reddit, what are some habits of yours that you have realized are wrong? I know that this subreddit has a lot of adults, including a large number of parents. And you guys often see a lot of posts about how much teenagers hate themselves, their schools, parents, siblings and basically their life. A lot of it criticizes some of your activities, which you believe that you're doing for their betterment but it's having the exact opposite effect. 
What are some of your realizations/ experiences?
