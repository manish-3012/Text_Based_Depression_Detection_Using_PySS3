apparently it isnâ€™t even that hard to change everything about me so I used to be a lazy fuck i still kinda am but recently i failed an exam and realised that i have a super important exam next year and that I had to change and it wasnâ€™t even that hard to change all i did was start working out regularly(i was fat not overweight but still kinda fat) which sure is pretty hard but eventually after doing it for like 2 weeks it becomes pretty much a part of my life and basically nothing can be harder and tiring than exercise at least not for me so I basically have enough motivation to finally get my lazy arse up and study and Iâ€™ve found that it low key helps me to focus in class and not sleep so thatâ€™s pretty cool so my life isnâ€™t completely pointless anymore
