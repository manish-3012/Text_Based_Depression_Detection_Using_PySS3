Is it part of growing up to progressively start feeling like shit? Like I just kinda feel worse like physically and more tired even though I work out, statistically in the gym I am doingn better now than I was 3 years ago, but im always tired and feel like shit ig. Also i go through like super optimistic and pessimistic mood phases, and the optimistic one is always sarcastic. Do i need to go to a doctor or do other people feel like this.
