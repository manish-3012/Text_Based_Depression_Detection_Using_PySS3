Just saying, just because some women aren't even allowed education, that doesn't mean women who have access to education still can't experience sexism I don't get why guys, who have never experienced sexism other than the rules of masculinity they have created for themselves, get mad at women for complaining about sexism and say that they don't experience it because other country's have it worse. Do they not realize the reason they don't think it happens is because they don't experience it because theyre not a girl/minority?
