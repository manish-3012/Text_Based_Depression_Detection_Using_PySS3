Iâ€™m tempted to see if I can go a day without being on Reddit But also Iâ€™m pretty addicted to it so I donâ€™t think I would be able to do that but I also kinda wanna try so Iâ€™m going to try. 

I know nobody really cares but Iâ€™m gonna be off reddit for 24 hours (unless I fail which would be pretty pathetic) starting at 12:00, so in about 30 minutes.

So goodbye for a bit.
