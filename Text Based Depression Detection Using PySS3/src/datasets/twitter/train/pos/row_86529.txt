Fuck dude I really miss you :(( Maybe the past is holding me up. I keep the memories and replay what was. Cause when I think of our friendship I always seem to smile cause I was happy for a while. And now that youâ€™re gone it really hurts and Iâ€™m getting used to all of the tears. And when friends ask if Iâ€™m truly doing good, I gotta pretend. And I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll smile again. Did you know you saved me?
