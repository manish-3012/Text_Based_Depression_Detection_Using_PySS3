I need motivation. As the title says, I lack motivation.

I mean I have an ambition. I wanna become a writer and a humanitarian but I don't have anyone who cares. Who encourages me to do it. Obviously, people on the internet are supportive at times but I want someone who personally knows me to cheer me on tell me I'm doing good.

I'm only 15 but I feel like I've wasted a lot of time and not only do I lack motivation, I also feel discouraged. I love writing but the thing is I haven't written a story. Not even short story.

Whenever I try writing, I end up fucking it up or just not being able to frame it in words or not develop a proper plot which discouraged me further and now I feel like maybe, even writing isn't for me. I can't do it

*sigh*

I just need some motivation and guidance to get my ass up and work.
