I got caught for not cheating Well the stories kinda goes like this..... during my test, I took a book to the restroom, not to cheat but to simply hide it there. Eventually was planning to cheat but once I reached the restroom, I felt scared and guilty since I've never done it before, so I just hid the book behind a broken urinal, i mean, what could go wrong......

A prefect found it and I'm kinda fcked now
