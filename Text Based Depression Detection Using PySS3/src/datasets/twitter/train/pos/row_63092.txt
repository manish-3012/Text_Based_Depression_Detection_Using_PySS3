my friend said his mam tested positive my friend is known to bullshit A LOT half time to get off school, he texted me bout 20 mins ago saying his mam tested positive for covid but i dont believe him as 1 week ago he said he had 'symptoms' which then  turned to 'tonsilitis' and then  comes back to school perfectly fine, should i believe him or not

plus someone in my family died of covid so if hes lying thats so fucked and my family who visited the person didnt catch it so that adds to it.
