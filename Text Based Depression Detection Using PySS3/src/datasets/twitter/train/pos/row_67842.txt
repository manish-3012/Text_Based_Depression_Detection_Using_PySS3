A completely unnecessary post. This post is completely unnecessary. It is unnecessary for me to create this, and it is unnecessary for you to read this. The flair is unnecessary, the grammar is unnecessary, and the repetition of the word "unnecessary" is unnecessary. In fact, you'd actually be better off not reading this unnecessary post. But if you were willing to read this unnecessary post and waste 10 very necessary seconds of your life, then congrats! You have made those 10 seconds unnecessary! You have wasted your time of your very necessary life. Just to repeat, this is unnecessary, so keep that in mind when you read this post.
