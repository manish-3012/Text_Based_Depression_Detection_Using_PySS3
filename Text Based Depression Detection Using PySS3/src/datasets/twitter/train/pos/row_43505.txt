I just finished AP History homework, and I think I'm a believer in the communist philosophy (maybe?) I'm not doing it because its a meme, I actually think I support the ideology of communism. We wrote a paper about Adam Smith and Karl Marx's views on economic philosophy (mainly about capitalism). In one paragraph, we had to say which economic philosophy we preferred, and I agreed with Marx more than Smith




Yes, there were a few aspects of Smith's philosophy which I agreed on,  but for the majority of it, I agreed with Marx more
