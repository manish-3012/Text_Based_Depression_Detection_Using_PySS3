Im so horrible xd 3 years ago in seventh grade civics, My teacher played a 9/11 video with the evil morty theme, over the entire thing.I broke out into laughter as it was showing a guy jump out of a building.She sent me out of the room and I had to wait outside the class.When we went to math, kids where crying and I kept on laughing, with a smile on my face and even now I look back and laugh.One of the kids who were crying is named lahna, who is still my friend to this day.
