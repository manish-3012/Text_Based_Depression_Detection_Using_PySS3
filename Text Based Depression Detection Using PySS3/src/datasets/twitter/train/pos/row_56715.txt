&amp;#x200B;

You wake up, to another shitty e school day, but today, nothing happens... you wait and wait and wait.... then your homie calls you... asks you where are you... confused you reply... what do you mean, where should i be? Bro... its computer exams in the school. Now you flash back to the time 9:25, its 8:53. You feel the rage going inside you, as you even commented and asked what day it is held on. No reply, so... you are fucked, the soonest train you can get is at 9:15, and you have a 20 minute journey ahead of you. As i write this on the train, how fucked i am?
