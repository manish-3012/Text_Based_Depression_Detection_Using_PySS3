You know that moment when you have been eyeing on something and you eventually got it? I've been wanting to try out a new clothing style but I thought my parents wouldn't want me trying them out because it can be a little bit revealing even though I've seen a lot of girls wearing it

but my parents picked out one of them and said that I can try it on and so I did

and I got it eventually :)
