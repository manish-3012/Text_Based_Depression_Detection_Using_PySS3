I think I might have raped my girlfriend and I fucking hate myself right now...  

A little backstory, I'm a 15 year old boy and I've been in a relationship with this girl for a little over four months now.

A couple nights back, me and my girlfriend were laying on my bed chilling, when I was rubbing her ass and was feeling horny. I started rubbing around her clit area and I think by this point she had fallen asleep. I'm pretty sure that at one point I tried to finger her but didn't and rubbing around her clit area was as far as it went. When she woke up I felt instantly guilty and felt so awful. I cannot remember if I was fully aware that she was asleep or not but either way I felt like a horrible sex offender and almost burst into tears. I spoke to her about it shortly afterwards and she has told me that what I did does not violate her boundaries and even if I did finger her that would still have been consensual. She said that I should stop worrying and being anxious about it because I have done nothing wrong and have not violated her boundaries.

I still feel like the worst person on Earth and I deserve to be punished. What do people think about this, am I a rapist?
