tinder gone wrong so i (18f) met up w a guy on tinder and it was going great and he complimented me and we were vibing and getting along and it was wonderful and then this morning when i texted him i saw i was blocked and unmatched and i have no idea what i did wrong, like im kind of weird and chubby but if he didnt like me why not just tell me instead of blocking me? it really hurt my confidence in myself and i just feel like complete shit, have you guys ever had anything similar?
