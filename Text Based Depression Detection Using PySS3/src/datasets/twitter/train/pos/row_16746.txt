I promise you, everything will get better I know everyone says that and it's hard to believe sometimes, but you have to try your hardest to believe it because once you do, it will get better.

I've struggled with mental health a shit tonne, lots of people do. I've attempted suicide on multiple occasions, fallen into addictions, and ruined relationships because of how my mental health was. I had no hope in life for a long time.

I moved away from my family and problems, overcame my addictions and now I'm surrounded by people who actually care about me. Living with my best friend who I've known since I was 4, I've got a decent paying job, a girlfriend who is amazing, and I'm not depressed anymore.

I faced my problems head on. Sent myself into a pit of self hatred doing it, but I came out a million times better.

Don't give up, please don't. People love you, even if you feel like no one does, there will always be someone out there who does.

Yeah rant over, time for work. Have a good day peeps &lt;3
