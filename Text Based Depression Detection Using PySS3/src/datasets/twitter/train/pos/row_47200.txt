How would one go about... Getting high with my friend. He's been my best friend for like 3 years and I've known him all my life but I haven't actually seen him in like 2 years. He might actually be addicted to weed by the fact that he's high  pretty much every day whereas I have never been high. What kind of social interaction would lead to that outcome and like when would I know, you know. Like he doesn't meet up with his friends much and whenever he has I havnt been invited so like idk
