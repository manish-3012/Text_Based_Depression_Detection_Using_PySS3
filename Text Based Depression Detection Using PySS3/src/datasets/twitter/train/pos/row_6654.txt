I met a guy I met a guy once and he was really nice and he seemed interested in me and I got a crush on him and I had my first kiss with him and we got close and went out on dates and stuff and held hands and he was just the most amazing person ever and I loved him and then I woke up and find out that he wasn't real and now I'm really sad.
