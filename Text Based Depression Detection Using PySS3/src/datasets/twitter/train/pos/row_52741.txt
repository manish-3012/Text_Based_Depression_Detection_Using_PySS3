My day has just been ruined. Me and mom went to jack in the box at 2am. I ordered 3 boxes of mini tacos without lettuce. Instead gotten 6 big tacos with lettuce. Had to drive all the way back to jack in the box. Thankfully they exchanged the big tacos for my correct order. All after having a social anxiety attack as I am not good with confrontation.

Tl;dr Jack in the box got my order wrong, thankfully got my right order after having a social anxiety.
