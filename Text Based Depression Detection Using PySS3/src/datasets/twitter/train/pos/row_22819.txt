My spring break is going to suck lol Tomorrow I have to catch up on a lot of homework and take care of 3 kids (my cousins and one of them is a baby) while taking care of 2 new puppies (their puppies that arenâ€™t potty trained) and 1 dog and 2 cats and I have to do it all alone because everyone in my family is working. My spring break is going to suck :(
