WHY DOES AUTODESK MAYA HAVE TO BE SO EXPENSIVE GOD I WANT IT SO BAD UGHH (3D nerds get what Iâ€™m talking about) I donâ€™t have maya for any of my school classes nor do I really have the ability to afford the 1000 dollar a year price of maya, but Iâ€™m just really upset because I was looking to learn maya. Blender is fine and all but it just seems like maya has so many more cool features Iâ€™d want to use and it sucks to me. ughhhhh. I just like doing it as a pastime and seeing that I canâ€™t get this software saddens me
