girl from omegle joins my class zoom So I signed up for Tech Club in October and it was my first time participating on Zoom. I went before the Pandemic started and then they stopped doing it. So for my first time, I joined, they introduced us and everything. Things were nice. A bunch of people joined, one named "Nicki Minaj" and "Anya". So we were talking about a website development competition and half way into the slideshow this girl, Anya, says "So what happens if you are from another school?" which felt really out of place and odd. The teachers didn't understand and wanted to elaborate and she said "Well, uh, I'm not from this school.". This was tech club for only my school so that was weird. We asked her where she was from and she's like "Uhh yeah, I'm from Tennaseee". That was extremely weird. We're in Oregon so that was extremely far away. We asked her how she got here and she told me her that her friends told her about it in a chatroom. We asked her what kind of chatroom and she then said, "This guy on Omegle spammed the zoom link so I'm like sure whatever". The teacher asked "What's an Omegle?" and the student helping them started sighing and he's like "Ohhh man Omegle is a place filled with creeps and predators and uh...", then when we were piecing things together the person named Nicki Minaj just says out of nowhere "YOU BITCHES DIDN'T LET ME FINI-" and spammed music before getting kicked. The other students are all silent, then someone asked  "Whaat was that?" and the teacher's said "something innapropiate".
