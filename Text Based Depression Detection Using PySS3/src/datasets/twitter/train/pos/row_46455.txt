if i fail this class i owe a lot of money my procrastination has gotten so bad. i literally didnâ€™t do my assignments for a class. theyâ€™re due today (in 4 hours) and iâ€™m trying to do them but i donâ€™t think that iâ€™ll be able to finish them all.  if i fail the class i think that iâ€™ll have to pay around 1000$. i could ask for an extension but i donâ€™t think the teacher will like that or give me one. i donâ€™t want to plagiarize or take someone elseâ€™s work either. help.
