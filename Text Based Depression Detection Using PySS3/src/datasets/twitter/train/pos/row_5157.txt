i feel like my life has just been going so badly

the reason im posting this is because i dont have a therapist, im afraid to ask my parents if i can have sessions, and i just need to get this out

recently ive been thinking about suicide

it started in september, when school started.

most of my classes were a bit hard to get to on time, and the teachers seemed confused, but all of that was expected. it didnt seem too different from what you would normally get amidst a pandemic 

after about a week, i had realized that all my teachers were assigning quite a bit of work outside of school, and it seemed sorta normal. normally in school, we would have our in-class assignments in every class, with some homework every now and then for each class, and nightly homework for math

&amp;#x200B;

but it was ok

&amp;#x200B;

now i get "asynchronous work", (which is the most bullshit nickname for homework) almost every day, for every class.

i have trouble keeping up with the amount of work im given, and as im writing this, i should probably be doing my homework

my family gets mad when im late for dinner

i have to give up the only times i get to interact with my friends, just to rewrite french statements i already knew from 6th grade

i rewatched an episode of bojack horseman called "the view from halfway down" which you may or may not be familiar with

in the episode, they include tons of references to things regarding why people commit suicide, how other people see it, why people don't do it, why you shouldn't, etc

thats the only fucking thing thats helped

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like theres nothing good left in life

people i look up to are dead

our current generation gets skin grafts and drinks bleach for views on tiktok

why the hell should i stay

i shouldnt have to be here to watch myself suffer

my family gets annoyed at me

my friends wouldnt understand

so i dont feel like theres anyone left for me

or anything good left in the world

&amp;#x200B;

ill probably delete this at some point

bye
