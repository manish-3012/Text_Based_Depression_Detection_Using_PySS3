Fuck my life, why do I have to like douches? 
I swear, I fall for the stupidest and most idiotic people ever. There is this guy that Iâ€™ve been sitting with for ages. He sits right in front of me so he messes with me pretty often. One time he started having what we now regularly call â€œfoot-warsâ€ where we see who can take each otherâ€™s shoe off first. There was this one time where our teacher caught us doing it and we got sent to detention. This stupid motherfucker told me that we should just skip detention and go to the restroom, and of course I liked him and didnâ€™t want to seem uncool in front of him, so I went along with it. I had to spend 2 long hours sitting next to him in a musty and crusty stall. Ngl, other than it being disgusting and him vaping in the stall, it was really fun talking to him. We ended up getting caught by a duty aide and had to spend 3 days with lunch detention together. I have to admit, heâ€™s a dumbass and canâ€™t type the pi symbol in his calculator for his life, but heâ€™s cute and quirky and knows how to make my day. Fuck me ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
