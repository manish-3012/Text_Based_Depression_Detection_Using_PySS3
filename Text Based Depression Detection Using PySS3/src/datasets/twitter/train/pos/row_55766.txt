Should I just leave reality? I'm freaking done with this bs.
Be nice and the world is hiting you with bricks.
I'm still going to at least try to accomplish my dream,but OH MY GOD!The little something of a positive view on life i had and it decided to fly away.
I've been studying and my butt off,now I have no self-confidence. 
Why should I even try helping my future self when I can just stay in my room and eat all day like other kids?
I know that I'm just talking smack, but why am I nice and kind my whole life so far?Ill keep being kind,something won't let me just ruin other people's lives all the time.But there are people that need someone to talk to!I don't give an F about you not doing your homework, can just someone in my life that I actually genuinely like and give all my spare time to them just straight up leave me?"You should try harder next time".They just freaking leave my life the same way they came in.

Its starting to get depressing again. Got out of depression 2 months ago,here I am again I guess...

Can anyone just please,tell me my next step?I'm getting tired.

Usually I write smilies, so here it goes :')
