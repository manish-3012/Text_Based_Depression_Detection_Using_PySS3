The US is no longer a free country. We canâ€™t vote in person because of COVID-19 and we canâ€™t vote by mail anymore.  Trump is also trying to tamper with social media outlets to suit his needs.  Such as trying to attack Twitter itself for fact-checking his tweets, and trying to ban Tiktok which famously thwarted his rallies.  You also canâ€™t protest outside unless you like getting beaten, shot at, tear gassed, or kidnapped by the police.  So we no longer live in a free country... fun...
