Just want to vent My parents have a pretty bad relationship. My mom said one she has enough money sheâ€™s leaving my dad (she doesnâ€™t know I know this). Their argument ruin everything. They usually only argue when my dads drunk, but recently they have been when heâ€™s sober. 
We had a really long drive ahead of us and my mom wanted to stop and visit places while my dad wanted to drive straight through. They didnâ€™t really argue about this until my dad drove past where my mom wanted to go. She started ignoring him until he asked what was wrong. She started yelling about all the work she did to find something to do and he yelled some stuff back. I got pretty scared cause my dad started going really fast and not paying attention to the road. 

Idk I just hate when they argue.
