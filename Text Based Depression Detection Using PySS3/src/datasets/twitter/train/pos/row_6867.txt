Thoughts on teenagers and WAP? I know this may come across as farcical but I am genuinely interested in peoples opinions on this.

My (18M) girlfriend (17F) has this kind of running thing with her female friendship group in which they will recite the song 'WAP' in it's entirety, which is all good fun (My male friends and I do the same with ram ranch), however when it gets to the parts which are overtly sexual, and describe performing sexual acts, she seems to be incredibly passionate with it, especially considering her age, and I'm worried that I'm going out with someone hypersexual. I'm concerned because she is a virgin and fairly pure yet she recites those lines with such exertion that you would think she's rather experienced. Is WAP ruining young girls perception of sexual relationships?
