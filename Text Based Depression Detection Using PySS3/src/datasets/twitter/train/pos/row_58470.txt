Is it ok for me to be sad even tho i really can't complain ? I mean... I have a great family, a bit house, i'm not opressed by anyone, i'm not bullied, i'm not disabled... I really can't complain about life. But sometimes i'm just sad and i don't wanna be a spoiled kid who complains for nothing. i'm just sad.
