am i an asshole for making fun of/talking crap about a pervert? TW: S\*XUAL HARRASSMENT

Basically (i am 14f, other person 15m) (probably going to keep this short), I met this guy through a mutual friend and a school function, probably last year, and we started texting as friends. However, he started getting really creepy and making unsolicited comments like "sometimes I look at your ass." I told my friend about this and she told me that it wasn't a good idea to date him or be interested in him since he's a pervert and even made sexual comments about her sister and many others. Later, I texted him to stop, because his comments made me uncomfortable and he replied "okay," only to continue making sexual and crude jokes/comments in the future, even asking me how much I m\*stubate in a week (we were playing t/d on ft). He even slid up on my story saying "hey qt what's up" and even came to me when he JUST BROKE UP WITH HIS EX.

I stopped talking to him after that, but I told my other best friend about all of this, and we make a lot of jokes about him and lowk talk shit about him when we text LMFAO. He also posts "freaky" shit (idk if you would call it freaky but it's always something about him wanting a gf or something) and my other friend will make fun of him about it too and I agree with the jokes. AITA/WE the assholes for doing this?

TLDR: my friends and i sometimes/frequently make fun of this pervert we know who s\*xually h\*arrasses people, aita? also sorry for the extremely bad grammar, as i rushed writing this post
