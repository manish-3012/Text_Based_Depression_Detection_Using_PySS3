My teacher is like the cliche â€˜worst teacherâ€™ Iâ€™ve got a teacher and I canâ€™t remember from the guidelines if names are allowed, but letâ€™s call her Mrs. S, sheâ€™s absolutely awful. Every day in class she constantly calls out this kid (J) and itâ€™s annoying watching her be so pathetic as to write him up for looking at one of us cause she assumed he was talking, while as half the class is having full conversations. She deliberately targets all of us while girls do most of the things that are actually troublesome (Iâ€™m part of the boys group in case that wasnâ€™t clear). The funniest thing is seeing how pathetic she will be to prove her â€œpowerâ€, I can be getting work out of my bag, pull out an assignment, and if itâ€™s not immediately set perfectly straight when she gets to me, she just passes by. You get written up for â€˜disrupting classâ€™ if you whisper to someone and help them with work. She even made me repeat a test three times cause she lost it over and over, Iâ€™ve even seen evidence that her genes are beyond stupid, when she told us a story about how her daughter believed it when someone told her that their account had been hacked and the cops would be called if she didnâ€™t empty her bank account and bring the money to a certain location, she was late to an event she was supposed to be hosting cause they also told her not to call or tell anyone. Now, whenever she exerts her power and writes us up, or yells at stupid things we did, I just laugh to myself, and everyone understands why itâ€™s so funny, cause others laugh with me too. Sheâ€™s a laughing stock at this point with how annoying and demanding she is.
