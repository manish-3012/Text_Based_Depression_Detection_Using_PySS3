I'm experiencing a dilemma My parents keep telling me it's good to be bored, but then they get mad at me for not being productive? Like, I'm bored, what do I do? sit there and do nothing? That's not productive, or I try to play video games which is more product than doing nothing, but they tell me it's not productive? What?
