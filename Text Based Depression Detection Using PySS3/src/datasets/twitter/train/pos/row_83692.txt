After a year without self harm My mom surprised me with a cat! After being hospitalized and and cutting myself I was finally able to overcome this situation. Iâ€™m insanely proud of myself for overcoming this obstacle and wanted to share it with the Internet! While not most important itâ€™s still cool that my mom surprised me with a cat as a bit of a job well done gift! Her name is Tobi and she is 2 months old. Picture of her and I in the comments (picture if blurred for my own privacyâ€™s sake :) )
