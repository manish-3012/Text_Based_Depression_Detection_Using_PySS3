Can my teacher legally do this? So, my teacher had an extreme policy on phones. If you get caught using a phone in his class, he confiscated it for 5 school days. Not regular days, school days. 

If these school days are not consecutive, say a weekend, or Christmas break, he keeps it until all 5 days have elapsed. Meaning, if you get caught using it the day before a long break, too bad so sad, you donâ€™t get it back until after the break. 

Can he legally do this? It feels like it should be illegal, but Iâ€™m not sure.
