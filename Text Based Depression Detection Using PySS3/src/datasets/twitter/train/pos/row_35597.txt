people who have the epic (ðŸ˜Ž) keyboards and just randomly press keys and type The short story â€The Penisâ€ is written by Hanif Kureishi. The short story is about a penis, which has been separated from its owner Doug, who we hear from later on. 

At first though we hear about a guy called Alfie who was â€œa cutter â€“ a hairdresser â€“ and had to get to workâ€.  He is having breakfast with his wife, when she asks him what he did last night, and if he had a good time last night? Alfie can not remember what he did last night, he then looks in his wallet to examine how much money he had spent or if he has any cocaine left or anything else, which could give him a clue of what he has been doing.  He finds something strange inside his pocket. In his pocket he finds a penis, with balls, and pubic hair.
