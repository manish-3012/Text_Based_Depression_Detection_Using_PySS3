Help me brainstorm some daily goals? I have a journal I keep every day to improve myself, and a set a couple daily social goals for the next day, like at school to do something. But I donâ€™t really have many different goals I canâ€™t think of to change around. All Iâ€™ve got at this point is â€žgive someone a complimentâ€œ, â€žsmile at someoneâ€œ, or start s conversation with someone youâ€™ve never talked toâ€œ. Anyone got any ideas, I could use some more, tried looking up some and couldnâ€™t find anything
