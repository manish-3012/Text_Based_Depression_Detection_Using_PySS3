Shoutout to the Reddit support team! So my phone died and I had to reset it to factory settings. The point is I lost backup codes for this Reddit account. But thanks to the Reddit supper team, more importantly u/TheOpusCroakus , I was able to retrieve my account. Letâ€™s have a huge horaay for the team and Reddit!!
