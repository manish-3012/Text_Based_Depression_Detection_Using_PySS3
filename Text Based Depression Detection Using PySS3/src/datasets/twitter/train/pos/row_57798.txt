So that happened I was doing a geo rest and half way in we were called into the assembly. ( in Australia we have been in school since the start of term 3). And apparently we were called out cause someone had:

Jammed one of the cafÃ© doors

Put a note saying â€˜use the other door :)

Put the hand sanitizer and paper towels in the microwave

Lit the microwave on fire

And now we can cheese the essay because one of the main obstacles was adapting to a stimulus.
