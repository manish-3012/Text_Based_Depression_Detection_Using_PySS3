Okay quick question Some dude from a school I used to go to just added me on snap. I only use snap for family and close IRL friends but since I knew him I added him back. So he sends me this picture of a monkey with sunglasses filter saying â€œRemember me?â€

Then we talk a little, and then: he asks

â€œAre you still short?â€

So I say â€œyeah, I havenâ€™t grown. But I have been getting a lot better with managing my anger and I havenâ€™t been to the office once this year.â€ (At that school I was constantly in trouble and always getting into fights)

Now he responds 

â€œIâ€™m so proud of uâ˜ºï¸â€

What does this mean 

Iâ€™m a girl, donâ€™t understand guys. At all.
