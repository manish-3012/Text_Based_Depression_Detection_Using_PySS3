Making a child doesn't mean you deserve respect I keep hearing people say "your parents created you, you should show them more respect" (mind you, I'm always told this when I point out something insane my parents believe) for example believing being trans is white privilege... How did you even get to this conclusion? 

It's not hard to make a child, most people on this sub are physically capable of it, and it's not something super impressive, like going to an Ivy League school. If two sexually repressed teenagers getting it on at Jesus camp can do it, my parents can do it. Just because you fucked somebody does not mean you're entitled to respect.
