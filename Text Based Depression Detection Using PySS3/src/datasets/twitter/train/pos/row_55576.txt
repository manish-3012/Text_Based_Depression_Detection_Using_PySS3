So today in Becky's life New guy moved into the supported housing I live in, I have 100% confirmation I'm moving from the room to the flat here, and I painted my nails. 

Also I have discovered none if my friends ever really cared and like me as much as I like myself :( 

But it's all turned out good coz still I can talk to my fish
