What should I do? Me and my crush go back a looong way(ab 6y or so). We became rly close after a few years, and she was the first one to confess. I liked her, but I didnt say it. And I confessed to her, 2 years after she told me. She wants us to become close friends and nothing more, and I respect that decision. It's just that... How close can I get to my crush?
