Why do parents always bring up their â€œstoriesâ€ from when they were a kid? I was doing something and my mum asked me to put my clothes away and I said â€˜in a minute, Iâ€™m gonna finish thisâ€™ and she got really angry, yanked my iPad out of my hand and went on a rant about how she does everything in the house and nobody cares (conveniently forgetting the 4 chores I did yesterday) and she also brought up â€˜wHeN i wAs EiGhT i DiD aLL mY oWn wAsHiNg bEcAuSe gRaNdMa wAs wOrkInG tHeNâ€™ like Karen how does that link to this or contribute in any way to the conversation, like oh no, poor you from 35 years ago, here have a medal for your child self and you can also tell us about how useless my generation is and how lazy we all are
