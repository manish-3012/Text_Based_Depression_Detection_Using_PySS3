What do I do now? 
So just like an hours ago my girlfriend revealed something that left me torn... She did this (by showing nudes to another guy) because she was mad and sad at me for taking short breaks(2-3 days) in our relationship because I havenâ€™t been in the best mental health. This time she thought Iâ€™d really leave her for good so she has been flirting with this one guy and the guy knew about me and her relationship.. so when she said I took another break this guy asked her for her nudes constantly.. She gave in without telling me, which really broke me.. These past few months my mental health hasnâ€™t been in the best because we rushed our relationship and I never really built trust in her because she always have flirted with other boys which made me overthink a lot.. But now this really made me lose all trust in her. I donâ€™t know what to do now.. Do I break up with her for good or do I give her another chance?
