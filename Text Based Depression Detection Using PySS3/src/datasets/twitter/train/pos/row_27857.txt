Why the fuck do schools hire teachers who can barely speak english I'm sorry if i sound like an asshole. My family are immigrants and they don't speak any english. I know English isn't easy to learn, it wasn't my first language either. But my school is forcing us to take atleast 4 semesters (2 years) of a foreign language class. This teacher I have right now has absolutely no idea how to communicate with her students. I have an A in the class but its just so annoying and no one is learning anything.
