How on earth do people play ukuleles I'll get straight to the point. I (16M) made ukuleles together and painted them, and now that it is done I am trying to play it (usually play guitar) but I. can't. squeeze. my. damn. fingers. into. this. damn. thing. What hateful god would create this suffering for all of humanity?
