Is it weird or creepy that I like to organize all of my life's photos into specific folders? So to be more specific, I have OCD. And I had a bunch of photos on my computer from my whole life. They were just on there as they came from the camera, with no real titles or anything. Just numbers. And I let them be for a long time.

If you're interested, they're photos from when I was 5, to 19 today. For ages 4 and below, I only have a few paper photos.

But anyway...I was looking through them...and it was just such a disorganized mess, and hard to keep track of.

So I made 4 folders...one named "Child Photos: Ages 5 to 9"...another named "Pre-Teen Photos: Ages 10 to 12"...another named "Early Teen Photos: Ages 13 to 15"...and last but not least, "Late Teen Photos: Ages 16 to 19."

This was so much easier for me, and helped get rid of a lot of the anxiety.

But then, one of my friends was like, "you have zero posts on Instagram. Do you even take any photos of your life?"

I was like, "Sure. I actually have very organized photos of my whole life, from ages 5 to 19, organized in specific folders, child photos, pre-teen photos, early teen photos, and late teen photos."

And he was like, "Dude that's actually creepy and weird as hell. I'd much rather you just have no photos of all than do that shit."

And I was like, "How is it weird? Seems normal to me."

And he was like, "It's weird because what the fuck are you trying to do? Make a fucking portfolio of your entire fucking life till you die?"

And I was honestly kind of hurt by this.

Even if it is weird or creepy though, I believe my reason of having OCD makes it justified.

Plus, they're my photos. I can do whatever the hell I want with them. What others think doesn't matter, because they're not their photos.
