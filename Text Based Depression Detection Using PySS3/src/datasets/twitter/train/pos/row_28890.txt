Anyone else feel like they are incredibly boring people? I feel like the flavour vanilla when it comes to everything. I'm not funny, I never get enthusiastic, and I don't give much of a fuck about anything. My life looks like this: School, Exercise, game, sleep repeat. I never hang out with friends outside school, dude I never even chat with anyone outside of school and family. I feel lonely and sad quite often because of it and it sucks.
