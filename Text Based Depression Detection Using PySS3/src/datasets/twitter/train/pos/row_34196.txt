I know it's technically normal and uncontrollable, but I feel so guilty about having dreamt about my ex It wasn't a memory or a nightmare or sexual, just your average dream, and I think we were broken up in the dream-canon, but I/he did behave the way I did when we were together.

I just hate how much dream-me enjoyed it. It feels wrong. It was like my subconscious telling me I still want to be together, or that if we were to hang out now it "could be like before", which would be selfish considering why we broke up.

There's no point to this post, just felt like putting my thoughts to words.
