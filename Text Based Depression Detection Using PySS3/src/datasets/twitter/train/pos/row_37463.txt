Being left on delivered Hi, a friend of mine is regularly leaving me on delivered and it's making me really anxious. To give you some backstory, me and him are in a friend group of 6 people together. I always see him opening the gc message but he just straight up ignores mine. Most of the time he takes longer than an hour to reply. I have asked a few friends in the group about and they told me he didn't leave them on delivered. Pls give me some advice or whatever, cuz I really hate this. Don't tell me to cut him off cuz that's not an option.
