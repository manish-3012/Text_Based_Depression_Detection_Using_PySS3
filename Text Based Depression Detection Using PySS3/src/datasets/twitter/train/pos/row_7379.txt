Anybody else talk in their sleep? Whenever Iâ€™m at a sleepover my friends will tell me about the weird shit I said while asleep. I also wake myself up pretty often but get stuck in that half dream/half real life phase and continue to talk before I realize Iâ€™m by myself in a dark room at 3 am. This happened last night and I realized that it was late and I didnâ€™t want to wake up my sister and literally told the imaginary person â€œtalk laterâ€ til I realized what happened.
