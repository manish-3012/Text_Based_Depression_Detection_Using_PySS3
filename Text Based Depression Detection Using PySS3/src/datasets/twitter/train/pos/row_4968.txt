Iâ€™m finally going to do it Thereâ€™s this guy Iâ€™ve been friends with since grade school. He graduated in June and is currently serving in the military. Anyways, Iâ€™ve liked him since we were kids and Iâ€™m finally gonna tell him how I feel. I sent him a message asking if we could talk, and I guess weâ€™ll see how it goes from there? Honestly Iâ€™m so nervous because Iâ€™ve chickened out every other time I had the chance to confess, but Iâ€™m hopeful that our relationship wonâ€™t change if he doesnâ€™t like me back (which I know he probably doesnâ€™t)
