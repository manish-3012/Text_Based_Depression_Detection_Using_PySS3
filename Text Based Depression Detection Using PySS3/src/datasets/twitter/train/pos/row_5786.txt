We did a test in biology We had a blood type test, im O+. Im really afraid of anything unwanted going inside my body and i have a condition that make my senses super sensitive. I hot visibly scared and hurt and some guys made fun of me over reacting. And i managed to scare one girl in my class with my actions to not take the test. Pretty neat
