going from talking to someone 24/7 for the past year and a bit to not talking at all fucking sucks i dont think i had gone a day in nearly 15 months where i didnt talk to her, and now i havent talked to her in four days cause we broke up. im so fucking lonely, everythings so quiet. theres no more laughter on our facetime calls and no more game nights. 

i sent her a message tonight, then unsent it before she could see it. sheâ€™s asleep anyway. i watched her snap story again, she seems to be having a good time. sheâ€™s busy, doing a lot of stuff, smiling.

i havent smiled since a week ago. damn. 

fuck breakups. fuck you for breaking up with me because you didnt try hard enough. the whole point of a relationship is to fucking commit, and you didnt. at the first sign of losing the spark, you break up with me. well fuck you. 


ew im sorry ignore this im just fucking sobbing at 2am and have literally no friends to talk to
