Rip me and myself. A guy asked me out last night and I was like can we like take a lil more time before we date and then next morning I sent a text saying that my crush went up a little bit from before and now he's like he doesn't remember anything that happened last night. I kinda played it off coolly but I mean, F in the chat Bois and girls.
