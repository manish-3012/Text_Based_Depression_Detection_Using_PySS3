I think I messed my brother up? So I (14F) used to kickbox before the whole COVID thing, and my brother (16M) did too. We were messing around and just throwing kicks and punches. Literally didn't even hit each other, just dodging. 

I turn around for one second because someone is calling my name, and he KICKS me in the face. I end up going back and hitting the back of my head against the wall and he starts to laugh when I tear up. 

So --and I swear I have no idea how I did this, i was angry-- basically I got him on the floor and pinned him down, into a headlock and he just told me to let go, so I did. My dad and mom laughed and I just shrugged it off, because I don't even think that was me. 

He has been walking around so grumpy ever since. I think I broke him. Did I do something wrong?
