I just wanna say something Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Iâ€™ll try to be better but itâ€™s likely Iâ€™ll just end up doing something wrong again. I just wish I could do better. 

I love my parents and everything. I had good teachers, relatives and friends. Its all so good. And yet I somehow ended up a piece of shit.
