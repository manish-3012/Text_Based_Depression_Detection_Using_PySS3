Hey guys I need help about something. So the last few months have been really stressful for me and every time I do something remotely stupid or out of order i find myself having sleeples night and havin sudden bursts of anger/shame/disappointment in myself bc of what i did. For example i just remembered that i accidentally ran a red light and frustrated another driver, and when i remembered that i got angry/ashamed/disappointed (that is just one problem i worry about on the daily). How can I stop myself from doing that and being less disappointed in myself.
*sorry for bad English*
