*Not excited to go back to school \*copied from my post on r/school

I go back to school next Thursday. The 28th of January for me. Will be in Year 11/the 11th grade. Since New Year's, I have been dreading every day of my holidays, trying desperately to prolong each day so the arrival of school would seem further away. But, obviously it's inevitable. I go back in less than a week.

I hate being at school. The teachers either don't care about the students, seem dead inside and like they hate teaching, or are just...generally really annoying in the way they conduct themselves. My classmates piss me off too. They're loud and disrespectful. I guess I just also don't want to get back into the day-in-day-out schedule of long days and evenings spent doing nothing but school work and stressing about upcoming exams.

I'm a high achiever, meaning I'm not struggling with my grades. I do well. I just hate classes. It's not that I'm personally insecure at school, or anything like that. I just don't like being there. It feels like a complete waste of my time. I'd rather spend time with family, but I'll lose a lot of that time because I'll have to study for useless exams and complete assessments that will be of no use to me after school.

Any advice on getting through these feelings and working on accepting inevitables like homework, hours of study and having undesirable teachers/peers? I appreciate anything you've to offer.
