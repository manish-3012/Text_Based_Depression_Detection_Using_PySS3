i hate to bring this up... i've told my mom long ago that when my grandmother will be gone, i'll be leaving my hometown and i'll most likely have a low chance of coming back here. what's a good city to move into? 
I've only brought this up cause i only have a mom and grandma now. i don't want to be alone here in the future....
