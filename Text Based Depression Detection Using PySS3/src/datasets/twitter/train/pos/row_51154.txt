How did Facebook fuck this up I realize Bluetooth is an â€œexperimental featureâ€ but the oculus quest runs android, and approximately every other android device with the hardware capability to use Bluetooth headphones does it well, the quest doesnâ€™t, thereâ€™s a lot of latency, and it cuts out sometimes, everyone else does this well, wtf why canâ€™t Facebook

I got a quest 2 and it reminds me more of an android tablet than anything else, also I wish the hand thing was supported in more apps
