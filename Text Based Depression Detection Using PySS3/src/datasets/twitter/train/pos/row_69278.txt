Random song lyrics until I get a girlfriend day #7. From the song Warrior by Paradise Fears â€œSo I let you in
But I'm so scared of what you'll see
Just skin and bones
Hiding this monster inside of me
And I don't need much
I just need a little room to breathe
And I need you
But I'm not so sure you need meâ€
