Day 9 as a nursing student in Germany today I don't have a lot to say, because I learned how to document stuff and had to leave early to an appointment in the city. Day was still fun and all the seniors were happy, that pretty much already concludes the day, so I wish you a good day now, stay happy and healthy :) #putmorecareintohealthcare
