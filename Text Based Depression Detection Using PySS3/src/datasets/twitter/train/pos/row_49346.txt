Does anyone else think like this? my brain doesn't feel normal,i feel like i overthink everything,and over analyzing every situation.For example when someone is about to come over my brain runs through like 20 different things they coulf say and how i should respond.Like i feel like i think too much.I also rememeber the bad and embarassing things i have done and said.There are a  bunch of embarassing things i said like 6 years ago.And i still remember it all plainly down to ever detail.
