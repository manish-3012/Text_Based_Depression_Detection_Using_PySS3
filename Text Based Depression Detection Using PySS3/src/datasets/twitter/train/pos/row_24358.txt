Iâ€™m so upset  I dated this guy (broke up with him recently) and he was really depressed. Okay? So like a normal girlfriend I tried helping him through it. Heâ€™d tell me heâ€™d cut himself and I was so extremely worried. Recently he told me that he was sorry but he never actually hurt himself he just wanted to see if I cared enough. Who does that?!? Thatâ€™s so fucked.
