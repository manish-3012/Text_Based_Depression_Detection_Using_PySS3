Reasons why I wish I was a male.. because I'm bored (I'm not trans or anything it's just that sometimes it's easier to be one gender in an area. I know guys have it bad too, I'm not saying that they don't)

1. No dress code. I want to wear a tank top in 100Â°F weather and not be called a slut by a teacher. 
2. Not as big body SHAPE expectations. As long as you're not very very skinny or very very fat guys are usually very attractive.
3. I could maybe be a twitch streamer without being called a thot.
4. I can be an asshole but it'll be okay because "boys will be boys"
5. I can disagree with the wage gap (Personally I don't believe it exists as it has been disproven many times) without being called a pick me girl. 
6. Can join videogame voice chats without hearing "get off your brothers gaming setup", "go back to the kitchen dishwasher", "Make me a sandwich", "Oh fuck we have a girl on our team might as well throw", "woah you're a girl??? Add me! I swear I'm not a simp!1!!1!" 
7. Won't get catcalled (or at least as much)
8. Don't have to worry about makeup (if I wear it I hear "you should wear less makeup, you look prettier without it" if I don't I hear "you should try putting on some makeup, you look tired"
9. Won't get told "you should smile more" (or at least as much)
10. Not having to worry about my body count or whatever because I won't be getting called a whore.
