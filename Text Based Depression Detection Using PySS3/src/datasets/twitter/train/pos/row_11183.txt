Have any of you ever had a dog that you had to put down because it got old and sick? My family dog is really old and very sick. He is hardly able to stand lately. My family decided to put him down to end his suffering. We made an appointment with the vet for tomorrow morning. I have had that dog for as long as I can remember. My memory starts with the day we got him. I don't remember anything after that. He has always been there. I just don't know how to deal with this. I wanted to ask if anyone here has ever had ti deal with putting a pet down because I need advice on how to cope with it.
