Help! I Cant decide on which Major i should go with Im 16yrs old (m) Who lives in Mongolia Ulaanbaatar
Im currently a collage student At MK (Mongol Kosen)
I aleady spend one year here (barely because of the virus). And I have to choose my Major.
Im stuck between Bio-Engineer, Programist, Mechanical Engineer.
Im quite intrested in all of them but cant choose.
My mother said i must go by my own wish with what I wanna be but she makes it really hard because of my past experience (also she wanted me to be a Bio Engineer) Im just so scared of messing this up 
Ive looked into all of them but cant decide if i want to be
A lab worker
Some proggram dude at some company
Or a Guy Who fixes stuff.
I think i would be atleast decent at all of these things but just cant choose.
Every single bit of advice would be great
