Dream I had last night Ok so basically I had this weird dream last night that I feel like sharing. There were two parts of it, for some reason it just changed halfway through. The first half was that for some reason I was in India and had to leave for Africa with a bunch of other people, so we literally ran to Africa and when we got there there was some gate with an obstacle course behind it, and it was stuff like walking a tightrope over some waterfall, and the person who was supposed to be leading us said we were doing it to end racism or something. The second half I was at an FNAF theme park, which is weird because Iâ€™ve never even tried to play FNAF. I donâ€™t really remember anything else but I wanted to share because I thought it was interesting
