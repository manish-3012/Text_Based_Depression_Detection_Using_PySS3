So, this is something I messaged my friend on Discord at 12:18AM. I can't tell if I have gone to a higher plane of understanding or have gone back to caveman times. "since magnets can be unattracted to one another using a + side and another + side would that mean, that if we were to push something with a powerful enough magnet against an equally or more powerful magnet that we would be able to launch things beyond comprehension. or better yet, we have two very powerful magnets, one flipped on a - side while the other is on a + side and when the approaching magnet gets close enough, the still magnet turns around, putting a same-side magnet towards the other magnet pulling the object, it would launch it at speeds almost uncomprehensible? because there would be so much speed from the pulling of the two magnets that if the object being pulled were to be stopped, but having force against it, there would be so much energy stored inside that object that it would go supersonic speeds when repelled?"

Thoughts?
