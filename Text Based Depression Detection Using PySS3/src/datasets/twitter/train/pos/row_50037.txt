I know most of you wonâ€™t care but, I have to brag about this before I explode. Iâ€™m playing this game Shadow Fight 2 and I just beat the second boss after trying so many times. And the best part is, with the boss there are 3 rounds, and I didnâ€™t lose a single one. Iâ€™m feeling so awesome right now.
