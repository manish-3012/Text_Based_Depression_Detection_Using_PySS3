Advice from a girl, about girls In the past few days I have seen posts about boys giving advice about dating boys and Iâ€™m female and I thought Iâ€™d give it a shot. English is not my native language so Iâ€™m sorry if there are spelling and grammar mistakes. Also I might have forgotten a few things, so feel free to make your own post with things that I forgot _x000D_

A lot of girls are very insecure about themselves, especially because of/during  puberty, so itâ€™s feels really good to be complimented and reassured that we donâ€™t look like a mess._x000D_

You should try to be as friendly as possible. A lot of people say that nice guys finish last but thatâ€™s not true. Itâ€™s very refreshing to have an actually nice person. Itâ€™s great if your SO is also like your best friend. Someone who is understanding and always there for you._x000D_

We like affection but we are often afraid that weâ€™re too clingy. Itâ€™s great if you hug us first or a little kiss on a cheek, it can literally make our day. We also donâ€™t even need sex, itâ€™s completely overrated. A lot of girls are super afraid of their first time and show her or tell her that you can wait for her until sheâ€™s ready._x000D_

You should try to find out what a girls interests are, you donâ€™t need to pretend to love it but at least show a little interest. I think itâ€™s super attractive when a guy is interested in the same things as me. _x000D_

I also have something that you should try to avoid. Please donâ€™t send anyone dick pics without consent, there is just no good ducking angle for that. There are a lot of other ways to show a girl that youâ€™re interested in her. Itâ€™s just creepy and it feels kind of like sexual harassment.
