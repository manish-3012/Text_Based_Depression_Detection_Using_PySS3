Ever fallen in love with someone in a dream? Idk it sounds dumb but I fell asleep and dreamt about my friend (it involved sex and cuddles and that good stuff) and I fell for her. Like hard. Like hard hard. Like December first 00:01 *hard* if you know what I mean. And I woke up and still felt this massive immense feeling and then then I fell asleep again, his time didnâ€™t dream, then woke up with no romantic or sexual feeling for her like wtf
