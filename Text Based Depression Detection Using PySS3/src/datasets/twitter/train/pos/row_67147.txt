I found out i friend of mine is kind of in this church with a bunch of weird stuff going on. Ok so i'll try and keep this simple. 

I was talking to a classmate of mine that i'm close with. When they suddenly brought up religion. They continued to talk about their religion and i was doing what any normal person who didn't want to seem rude nodded along and asked questions.  I ended up asking where the church was. And they told where. I was like 'oh thats near my sports club' and proceed to open my laptop and try and search where the church was (to see how close it was too my club). When they suddenly got defensive and were like don't search up the church. I was 'sorry'. And left it at that. They continued to talk about they church and even went as far as to say 'oh i know this is going to sound like a cult'. I had no idea what they meant at the time. 

Anyway the talked for a long time. I'm pretty sure i was being recruited or whatever, they tried to invite me but i politely declined as i had no interest in joining a religion. 

So finally the conversation ended. And at the end of the day i was sitting at my laptop and remembered how weird the conversation was. I then decided to search the church up i was confused as to why they got defensive. 

So when i did it, came up with shit and a MOTHERFUCKING CULT. There are stories of people who got out of it from 1970 up until 2015. There were weird archives stuff. News reports. Stories about child abuse. Shit was crazy. 

But seriously i have no idea whether i should bring it up to them or not. They are really conservative no social media, extracurriculars, who they can talk to. Because i'm kind of worried for them. I also might just be really paranoid or something, the church could've changed. Any ideas?
