A New massive grocery store just opened near My town That place is dope, thereâ€™s multiple stores, And even a Cafe. In one of the stores theres a whole aisle full of cheese and it is heaven. Also theres a place where they sell baked stuff like croissants and baguettes nâ€™ shit and itâ€™s also so good.

Just makes me kinda sad for the local smaller store because today there Was basically nobody there.
