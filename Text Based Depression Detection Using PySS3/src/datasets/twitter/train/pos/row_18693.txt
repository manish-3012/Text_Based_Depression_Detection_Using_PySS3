Please opinions on these song lyrics So Johnny had a test so he wrote on his arm that

five plus three equals eight plus one

but we all know that in 

a few short years

he'll be six feet tall and broke to the ears

Or maybe it's Philosophy

Aristotle I dunno 

Growing certain plants in the backyard 

Oh, Here we go 

Again with the dreams

and short with the plans

I hear Bill got busted cause they found the three plants.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Oh here we go with the dreams of snow

melting down from a blizzard that'll pass by and we know

Oh here we go with the dreams of snow

Vanish when you touch 'em and look a little less once you know

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well a man came to town 

and was boasting about how he'll be 

a big man, rich man, richer than you'll ever be

But yesterday I saw him

shining shoes at a mall

That's still a thing anymore?

Aparrently so

he's no rich I guess no one dares to say no.

And I understand this song might be a tad bit juvinile

What do you expect, it's probably being sung by a child

but I think you get the messege that I'm trying to convey here:

Get rich schemes tend not to end with fame here.

And so I'll repeat what I just said sans verse form 

Cause this verse in question is getting a little bit too long

So,

&amp;#x200B;

Here we go with the dreams of snow

melting down from a blizzard that'll pass by and we know

Oh here we go with the dreams of snow

The buzzards will be circling o'er them when they don't show.
