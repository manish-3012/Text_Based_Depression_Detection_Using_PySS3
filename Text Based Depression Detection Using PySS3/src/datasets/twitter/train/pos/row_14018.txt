Cant get over him ðŸ¤© Sooooooooo if you look at any of my previous posts from lately youâ€™d know I was talking to this guy. He gave me every fucking sign he felt the same, called me hot, exchanged nudes, told me he was into me, everything. But when I finally told him how I felt, he basically used his personal life as an excuse as to why he couldnâ€™t like me. I wouldâ€™ve preferred a simple Iâ€™m not into u but ok. He lead me on hella hard imo. Iâ€™ve crashed and burned lmaoo. I cope with my issues by getting random boys to give me the validation I crave because now I feel so inadequate. Iâ€™ve cried every night for like two weeks. I just wish someone fucking felt the same, even just fucking one person. Iâ€™m tired of being the second choice, thereâ€™s always a girl heâ€™d choose over me and it makes me so mad. What makes me even more angry and upset about the whole situation is my friend constantly flirting with him and shit. Like dude, give me a week before you try to hop on his dick. I canâ€™t bring myself to block him, as much as I should. I canâ€™t bring myself to realize how toxic it is for me to cry everytime I see that he snapped me. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
