it really really sucks when you love someone and want to give them everything you have and it just doesn't work out i thought i was ok but i just ended up thinking about it and crying and i cant breath. i miss the feeling of thinking that they cared and would do the same things for me that i would for them and i just want the pain to stop but it wont.
