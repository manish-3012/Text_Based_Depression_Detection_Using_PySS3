can you guys help, i cant decide im moving in two weeks. i have a couple options. 

1. continue doing school virtually through my current district, and switch over to my new school at the start of the next school year 

2. switch to my new school at the end of winter break

3. switch to my new school at the end of winter break, but instead joining the virtual academy so i can stay home comfortably curled up in a ball next to my space heater of a computer, but not being able to take honors or ap classes

sorry i cant speak english too well despite it being the one and only language i understand and speak
