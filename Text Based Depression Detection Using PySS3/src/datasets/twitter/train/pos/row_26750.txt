Itâ€™s late in a shitplace where i live, but we have a great humour for our generation Even if weâ€™re depressed a lot and a lot us just want to die, we provide the most humour than maybe ever in our time. Every day we create thousends if not millions of memes, we laugh from everything, literally everything like from racism, gay people, history and even depression. We even laugh at simple images with little to meaning. Just the idea that one young person can create a clever joke that thousands of people can see is awesome in my mind. Just look at youtube, look how funny a lot of this shit is.
Weâ€™re maybe the dumbest and most depressed generatian, but for me for sure the funniest.
