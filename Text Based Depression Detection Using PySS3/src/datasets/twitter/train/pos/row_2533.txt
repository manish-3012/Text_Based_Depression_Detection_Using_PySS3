Would you rather work a stressful high-paying job or work 2-3 chill jobs that pay less? Bottom line is I need to make at least $2,000 a month and just got offered an interview at a new luxury restaurant, but I'm thinking about it and feel like I'd prefer a more laid back workspace since high-end jobs tend to be full of customers/co-workers/managers with sticks up their asses.   


I think I'd rather get paid little, work 2-3 entry-level jobs part-time, uber on the side, have more chill coworkers, and have a less stressful life. What would you guys prefer?
