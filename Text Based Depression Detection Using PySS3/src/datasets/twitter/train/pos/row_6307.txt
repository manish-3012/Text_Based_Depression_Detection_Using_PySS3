My bird died and my mom's boyfriend is not being nice about it About a week ago my tiel Kevin died because of old age (he was 16) I was devastated and buried him in my backyard with the help of my mom. And I'm not one to cry when someone close dies. But I was in tears for 2 hours straight. My mom then offered to get my another cockatiel(very young) for my birthday instead of a chicken and I said yes but however I made it very clear that it is not a replacement but an entirely new bird. My mom told my mom's boyfriend and he started calling me a crybaby and that it's "just a stupid bird" he even threatened to spit on his grave (there's no gravestone but it's a slightly raised mound of dirt) he then went on to keep bothering me for 3 days and I just wanted it to stop. I had to yell at the top of my lungs "shut the f**k up and stop being an a**hole" no one should have to do that. But we're on good terms now
I tried to keep this short
