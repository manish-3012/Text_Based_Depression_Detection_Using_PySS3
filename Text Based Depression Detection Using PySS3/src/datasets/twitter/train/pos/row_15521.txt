CW Powerpuff girls cast revealed. To make a long story short. Yeah no.

The cast is Dove cameron, chole Bennet, and Yana Perrault.

For one the girl who is suppose to be blossom (chole Bennet) isn't a redhead. Secondly the girl who is gonna play buttercup is black. (And before you say anything I'm black) these may be little problems but I feel like the cast already isn't great. Other people who agree with me have a problem with the Yana Perrault being buttercup for the wrong reason. They think they're gonna make her the "angry black woman of the group" which to me, I don't think the CW would be that stupid (I hope) and speaking of the "angry black woman" stereotype. Something tells me that they're gonna try and have a arc or episode tackling that. Which knowing the CW, they'll fuck up. And it wouldn't even make sense for Buttercup's character at all. (Considering she's white)



For me I like all the characters to be represented the right way. And that is what the CW cast isn't.
