Back me up here cuz I shouldn't be grounded So my little brother was in a box like last week. ( one of those cardboard boxes you get at home Depot) I never one thought it was cute, funny, and absolutely adorable. He would ask us to close it up and carry him around and he would pop out of the closed box and scare us.


But as soon as I put the kid inside coffin we have a problem. So yeah I'm grounded for a month. So I have a question for yall, should I be grounded or nah?
