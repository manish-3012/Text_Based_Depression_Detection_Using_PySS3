I don't like celebrating my birthday anymore. This is not an excuse to not spend money or something like that but since covid I didn't do anything on my 2 birthdays and realised that I can be satisfied/happy by not celebrating them... Idk why I feel this way maybe I'm too secure with being with myself or I'm being a dick idk... Just wanted to tell yall know this is how I feel after not celebrating my 16th and 17th birthdays. 
                                                       thank you.
