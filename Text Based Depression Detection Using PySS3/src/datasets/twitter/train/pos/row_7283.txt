My mom made comments about my crop top and now I canâ€™t wear them She said that my stomach was poking out and told me that everyone could see my hairy back. Asked if I wanted everyone to see my stomach. Asked if I was trying to show off my skinny body to everyone. Then at the same time makes comments about how if she had my waist sheâ€™d dress differently. I donâ€™t know what to say. What can I say? Itâ€™s teasing, or itâ€™s weird comments thinly veiled as compliments. Those 2 crop top hoodies were the first I ever bought. I canâ€™t even look at myself in the mirror and I thought I was making progress by starting to wear them around the house. Now itâ€™s all gone. She said those things to me over the summer. I havenâ€™t been able to wear them since. I tried about a week or so into being back with my dad but I was scared that everyone could see my stomach or my back so I changed after about 20 minutes. I havenâ€™t pulled them out of the drawer since then. I used to love them. They were comfy and I felt perfectly normal wearing them. It felt nice to wear something that most people my age also do. Now I canâ€™t. If I say anything sheâ€™ll tell me she was just teasing, or say that Iâ€™m being over dramatic because she had it way worse as a kid. And I have no argument to that. I know she didnâ€™t purposefully try to hurt me and I know she loves and cares about me. Itâ€™s not even a big deal. Itâ€™s about the tamest thing someone can do to another person. There are so many people who have it way worse. I just wanna be able to enjoy them again.
