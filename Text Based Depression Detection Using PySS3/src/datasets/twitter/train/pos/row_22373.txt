for those who are having a hard time, itâ€™ll all be okay â¤ï¸ hey guys! we as teenagers go through a bunch of shit and letâ€™s be frank, most of us arenâ€™t even making the best out of our teenage years. there are some of us who isolate ourselves in our rooms, some of us who can barely even leave bed because of the emotional drainage, and some of us who just feel like... nothing. iâ€™m here to tell yâ€™all that itâ€™ll be okay. iâ€™m serious. by staying alive youâ€™re already doing yourself a favour and youâ€™re doing a great job! trust me, everything will turn out just fine. a week ago i was fucking down, iâ€™ve never felt so low in my life and i couldnâ€™t even fucking focus on anything else but my own sadness. i spent my 16th birthday alone, can you imagine lol. today iâ€™m flourishing, iâ€™ve made a couple of new besties and my life is actually coming together again. what iâ€™m trying to say is that all good will come to those who wait, just trust the process. wherever the wind blows, it blows. yâ€™all are doing okay. nothing is easy but everything thatâ€™s shit will come to pass. all love! xoxo
