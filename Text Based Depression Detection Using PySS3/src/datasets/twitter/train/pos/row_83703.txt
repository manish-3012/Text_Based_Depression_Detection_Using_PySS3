My dad just threatened to kick me in the head. So story is I make a mistake and my dad yells at me calls me a dumbass grounds me. But this time I almost lost it on him. Im 14m for context writing on the verge of tears. He told me "if I see this kind of laziness again Ill kick you on the head" I know its an empty threat and he cant even kick higher than his torso. Just needes to vent, bye! (Sorry if written badly im angry)
