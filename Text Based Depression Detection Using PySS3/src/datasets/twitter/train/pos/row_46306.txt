Being blamed Ok so Iâ€™m not going to say names or schools but in Australia like America, vaping is a new dangerous trend anyway onto the story 

Iâ€™m in year 9 and Iâ€™ve been holding in this piss all day waiting for my teacher to finally let me go to the bathroom, fucking finally the dumb bitch allows me to go to the bathroom,
I run there and almost run into a pole on the way there, to no ones surprise there are at least 15 children crammed in the only bathroom in the school,  they see me walk in and try to hide their vapes by putting it by their side by I could see the smoke coming out of their mouths and the vape clearly in their hand.  So while Iâ€™m awkwardly pissing the troff these kids are looking at me waiting for me to hurry up and piss. They ask me if I saw shit on they way out, me being already unpopular as it is, said  no I donâ€™t know what your taking about, I left the restroom, one of the kids must of smelt smoke from outside and told a teacher, so now 80% of the kids in the year below me think Iâ€™m a snitch and want to beat me up. me being short, and underweight would be an easy target. 

If anyone reading this vapes just to become popular in high school donâ€™t ok, your only killing yourself
