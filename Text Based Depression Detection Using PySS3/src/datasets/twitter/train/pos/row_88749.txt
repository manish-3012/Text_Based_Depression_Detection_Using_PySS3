I fucking hate school I have lost all motivation for school. School has killed a lot of my motivation and a lot of my happiness and so I have lost the motivation to get a lot of my work in on time. Now my parents are taking away my phone and turning off the internet for any of my other devices. My phone and playstation have been the only happiness I get anymore. Mostly because my online friends actually care about me. My whole school despises me because of rumors. I did nothing to any of them, havent even talked to 90% of them yet they still despise me. Now my parents want me to do in person school instead of online. Now I have to deal with all the shit I get at school all again. This is just fucking terrible.
