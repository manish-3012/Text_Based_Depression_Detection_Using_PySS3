i REALLY needed a new game. i got it yesterday! yesterday my dad come home with two xbox gift cards. one for me. and one for my brother. i looked at my wishlist cause there was a game on sale i wanted. that game was hitman 2. my first hitman game. today i launched it and played it for 5 HOURS. i usually get bored of games WAY faster than that. best game i've ever played. 10/10.
