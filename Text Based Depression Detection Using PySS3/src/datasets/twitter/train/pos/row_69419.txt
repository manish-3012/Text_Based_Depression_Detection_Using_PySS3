I'm so lost right now So a friend of about 7 years(or more, I don't really remember) and I got into a small argument that apparently led to us not being friends anymore. I was his closest friend and he was one of my closest friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, on a public group chat, me and someone else were having a discussion on how I shouldn't be afraid of being myself, and the conversation moved to cancelling, to which he interjected that he hates being cancelled and left the group chat. He then sends me a private chat about every wrongdoing happening to him in the last year, 99% of which was resolved, and the other 1% i have no control over. So I reply to that, "dont bring your drama to me from now on" because I was fed up of him starting new drama every week, because it is literally only him who starts drama in the friend group. He says okay, apologizes, and that's that. 

&amp;#x200B;

two hours later, I was sleeping because I usually take afterschool naps, but I woke to the sound of him spamming me on private chat. He had written a long paragraph about how his ADHD makes him think of things from the past, and while he was showering he remembered that I made an offhanded comment in a conversation in a public group chat a couple weeks ago that " i only go to his house to meet his nice parents and he has a nice house" as a complete joke. He berated me on how you should never say that to a friend, which is probably true. But the thing is, many months ago, because I'm a really joke-y person and he's a really sensitive person, we both agreed for both our sakes that if I say a joke that offends him, he brings it up immediately that it offended him then I would apologize and refrain from saying that type of joke then on. We made this agreement because I would say lots of jokes and then weeks or months later, he would bring up screenshots or copy pasted messages of those jokes and use it against me. However, this time he didn't bring it up at all. I anyway usually say "jk" after my jokes towards him, but that time i didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after sending that message, he spams "fake friend" for about 50 times which woke me up. And let me give some context: for the past few months, I've defended him against bullies, I've listened to his rants, I'd read between the lines and know when he might be sad, I've basically been an amazing person to him. I was basically his healer. Everyone else in the friend group never took his problems seriously, just me. So it really hurts to be called a fake friend y'know?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, he puts an anonymous confession(it's a discord bot thingy) on a confession chat saying "i lost a friend today and gained +10 happiness". Like, what the hell? 

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, resuming the story, so two of my friends tried talking to him to no avail, I didn't really want them to talk to him but they insisted because they are amazing. So they told me what he thinks, apparently since after he left the public chat, I vented and basically said things along the lines that he gets mad at people who disagree with him in the slightest way(which is true), and how I always have to be his healer or therapist because no one else is, and I was sick of it. Someone else(Not sure who but I don't really care) leaked the conversation and told him everything. The conversation explicitly said I was venting, but he took it to mean that I really hate him and he really hates me so we shouldn't be friends anymore.

Okay that's the end of the story, sorry for the long read and bad paragraphs. Anyway, I'm really f\*cking lost right now. I have not cried in months, I actually do not remember when I last cried except for sad anime episodes. But I feel the tears coming. I'm fine with being his friend, but suddenly I'm a fake friend and he hates me? This will probably get buried under all the great memes, but I'd really appreciate if at least one person could leave a comment and tell me their input. I'm usually indifferent to things like this, but I really am just empty inside and have been listening to music the last four hours. I've been saying "lol" and "lmao" and acting indifferent about it all to my other good friends, but its not a joke. Thanks for reading
