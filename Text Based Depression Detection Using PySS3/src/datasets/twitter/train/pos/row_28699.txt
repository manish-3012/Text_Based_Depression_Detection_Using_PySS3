Really worried right now A few days ago, my mom's friend caught someone scouting our house. The same car passed by 6 times, and someone stuck their head over our wall. We think this guy's planning on robbing us.

Usually, that wouldn't be too much of a threat. But today I'm home alone until morning. So it's me, and a few dogs that would rather get belly rubs than help me fight off an intruder.

We have a camera that I can monitor on my phone, but guess what ? My phone's at 14% battery, and none of these chargers are actually working. I've asked a friend if they could bring one over, but they ghosted me. So yeah...

Risk of a robbery, limited charge on my phone, and I'm alone and getting sleepy. Not a situation I want to be in right now... I'll uh... Update this later if I can.
