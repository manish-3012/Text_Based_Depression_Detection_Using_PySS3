I hate when people belittle someones problems by one upping them Like seriously?! What gives you the right to dismiss someones feeling by adding yours basically ignoring theirs. And example of this is saying you have barely any friends and someone comes along and says atleast you have friends. 

Sorry for the short rant, had to get this off my chest
