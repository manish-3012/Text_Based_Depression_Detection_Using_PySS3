Am I the only 18 yo boy on this sub who is still a virgin? Idk it seems like it every time I browse this sub.

Yes, I am 18 and I never had a gf.

Idk all I do is work my arse off studying, play videogames, watch shows / anime, listen to 90s metal bands and workout.

Am I weird?

Btw thanks for reading and the first person to comment 'V' gets my free award cause why not
