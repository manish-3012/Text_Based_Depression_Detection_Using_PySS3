Being the group's innocent one So in my group of friends I'm kinda the innocent one. And the other day my friends were talking about onlyfans, and i just decided let's drop a bomb why not? I said to them, yeah onlyfans, I've heard of it, i was going to create an account, it's cool right? And they all looked at each other and were like, who's going to explain that onlyfans is not what she thinks it is. But i couldn't hold it any longer and started laughing. Anyway they really believed me. Advantages if being the innocent one.
