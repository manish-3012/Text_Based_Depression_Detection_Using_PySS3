I have some sad news So I play Mario Kart 8 deluxe a lot. Iâ€™m pretty good at it. So today I decided that I would go for a world record in the game, the all 48 tracks no items 150 cc record. I was about half way through, world record pace when my controller disconnected. Iâ€™m so sad right now. I put in like 50 minutes into that only to be fucked by my controller disconnecting. Iâ€™m so sad
