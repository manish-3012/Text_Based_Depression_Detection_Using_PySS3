How are the most toxic people so lucky and happy?! I swear its a law of nature or something that toxic people get the most luck and money and happiness in life, the people who are absolutely the worst all have many friends and love, loads of money and stuff. And they may not seem bad you just know they are. Sometimes i think people are just blind because they simply donâ€™t see how they manipulate people and hurt them in a indirect way. And yet they have all the luck. I am absolutely trying my absolute best to be the best person i can be, i am as polite as i can be and yet everything is fucking shit. No love no close friends and social anxiety, fuck this world.
