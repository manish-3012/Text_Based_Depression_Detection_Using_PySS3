serious question for y'all what is the problem with all these teens (mainly girls from my experience) that declare EVERYTHING as racism or sexism. like some kid in my French class had a go at a teacher for gendered words and all that. like, what? I've also had a debate with someone who just couldn't bare to think that using the word 'black' to LITERALLY DESCRIBE SOMEONE'S SKIN COLOUR wasnt 'casual racism'. they then proceeded to 'cancel' me on tiktok. like, are they actually that dumb. I'm no Einstein myself but I think I can piece together that that ain't it chief. idk, can someone explain how this widespread group of people who are like this have magically appeared? I just don't get it.

also if u saw this post like 2 mins ago, I accidently posted it on the wrong acc and removed it
