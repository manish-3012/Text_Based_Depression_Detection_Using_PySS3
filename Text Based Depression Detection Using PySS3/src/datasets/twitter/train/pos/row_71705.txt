Is it normal that ur last real scary nightmare was when u was like 7? Yeah idk once or twice a year I do still get afraid or jumpy when I fall in a dream and then wake up by it. But whenever my dream is leading into an "scary" scenario I beat it some kind of way, I can for example just turn lucid and notice that this doesnt make sense I'm dreaming. Or fight the guy who has been staring at me for long or just escape the situation. But often I dont get close to those situations.

I maybe should've posted this on r/dreams instead.
