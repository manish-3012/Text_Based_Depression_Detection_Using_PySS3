I made out with my crush's friend... So I usually hang out with two of my friends (both of them are males and I might have a crush on the other one, I still think them both only as my friends) at school. I think that they have been friends for 5 years (I've known them for 2 years) and they are very different. I usually talk more with my "crush" because we have same interests etc and we have stronger connection, people often ask me that do I like him and I always just say that we are friends. 

So the other friend invited me to his party week ago and well I got very drunk. I slept in his bed with him because it was the only available place. Nothing had happened yet, but in the morning when we woke up we talked and for some reason he kissed me. So we ended up making out and cuddling for couple hours.

Here is the problem. First of all he is not my type at all and I don't know how it happened. Both of us act like nothing happened and I don't think that he told anyone (I only told my best friend because I was freaking out). After all that happened, my "crush" has been showing more interest in me and I'm confused if he is just being friendly. And I'm not even sure if I have crush on him.

I just wish that this wouldn't have happened, everything would be easier...
