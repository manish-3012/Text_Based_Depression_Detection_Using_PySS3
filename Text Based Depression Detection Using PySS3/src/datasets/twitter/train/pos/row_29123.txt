I caught my friend vaping, what to do? Today I was hanging out with my friends. For privacy reasons, I will call them A, B, C, and D. Friend A came to my house, asking if I could bring some playstation games to play at his house. I said sure, and grabbed some. We ride our bikes to his house, and here comes friend B. B comes and interrupts our game and asks if we want to hang out with C. We went to C's house, and we went to the field across the street. Here comes friend D. We play soccer. Then, C takes out his vape. B comes to me, and asks wanna play truth or dare? I say sure. She says she dares me to try C's vape. I say no. She then says she'll try it if I try it. I say no again. He smokes again, and while I seem cool outside, on the inside I'm having a panic attack. B and C are both asking me to try the vape. I keep saying no over and over again. After a few minutes, I am able to to make to A's house and maybe we can play some games. I dont know what to do. If I tell my mom, she'll freak out. But I'm worried about C's health and him getting arrested. He's already been in juvie once for stealing a car or something like that. I keep seeing commercials about vaping hurting your lungs and hurting your immune system. My sister says her dumb classmates from college vaped and one got pneumonia. I dont want C to get arrested or make himself ill. Please tell me what to do.
