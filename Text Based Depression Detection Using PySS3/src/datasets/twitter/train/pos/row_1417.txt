So I slapped my sister today. This is a long post (Serious) I'm currently sobbing in my god damn room.

Backstory on me, this is how I'm trying to "defend myself" I guess. So, I did boxing for a couple years, which helped with my anger management a bit. But due to covid, and other issues even before that, I haven't punched anything properly for 2+ years, and anger is still building up in me, every single day. Main source of it is my sister. Multiple times a day, I imagine myself just exploding in anger out of nowhere in my room, completely trashing it. That's the verge I am on, constantly. I do, however have developed a level of self control to not do anything violent. This is how I'm living right now.


So, what happened was: Mom said something to me, to which I replied full normally, TO WHICH, that **bitch** of a sister I have, started provoking me like:  *nAh I wOn'T* (in that bitchy annoying copy voice they do) [my sister is 19, so 1,5 years older than me]

Yes it triggered me, to which she continued.
I said I'm gonna punch her if she continues - she did. So, I got up, went over to her, and slapped her in the face and went off. 2 seconds later she's bombarding over to me, grabbing my hair and kicking me, yelling at me ***HOW DARE YOU SLAP ME, YOU DICK!! HOW DARE YOU SLAP YOUR SISTER!***

Mom did not want to intervene, I understand. I was furious and you know when you hit that point when you don't cry, and you're just laughing in agony, that was me. Sister came over AGAIN, and hit me in the head twice more. That was the point when I started crying. Mom just said to us: "I don't want to get between you two, fight it off, but not in here", but I was already grabbing my boxing gloves, and I was ready to fucking go.

I told my sister: I'm gonna go over there. I am going to.

She said: no you fucking won't cause it's my room!

I said: okay then come over here, will ya!? 

She came. 

At first, I was just standing there, like "you wanna go, bitch?"
And so I did, and I hit her on the arm and legs on one side. She went back to her room, and I sat down. Then it was just yelling from my part, with pure anger, on how much I fucking hate her, and I want her dead, etc, the usual furious mindless stuff.

This went down in max 4 minutes. It was like 20 minutes or so ago. My head is starting to hurt, not from the punches, but from the bawling. I have not had a fight with anyone in the past 3 years. It kinda felt good tbh. 

In conclusion: my sister had absolutely zero reasons to start provoking me, and I TOLD HER the consequences, and she still ignored it.


Right now she's acting like nothing happened. Yes, I shouldn't have punched her. But imagine keeping all your emotions bottled up, and then getting that one last drop in the already full cup. 


Thanks for reading my rant.
