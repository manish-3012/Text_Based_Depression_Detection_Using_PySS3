Society as a whole is dependent on the people sorting by new. Had it not been for you guys, so many good memes would have died in new without ever seeing the light of life. It is because of you all that we can find good content not only in this sub, but all of Reddit. It is you that wade through the muck of oversaid and trashy content to bring the rest of us good content. Thankyou for your sacrifice.
