It works out with Hard Work (142) **Little by little, we progress, we move forward.** We have to remember its not about doing 100 different things daily, you definitely can, but its about **consistency**. Doing 1 thing a day towards your goal is better than doing 100 things in one day and then not doing anything more for a few weeks. **Stay consistent.**

We here the quote **"Work Smarter, Not Harder"**, well remember that we can do both simultaneously but the most important thing like we said is **consistency.** 

Everything takes time, so know that **you're exactly where you're meant to be, right now. Say it out loud "I am exactly where I am meant to be", keep saying it until the anxiety or rush to get to the next task subsides**.

We are going through times that most of us have never experienced before so its ok to give yourself time to rest, its ok to give yourself time to be still; **to meditate, get fresh air and just enjoy this present moment.**

**I am proud of you. I know you're doing your best, however "your best" looks like, its important for YOUR STORY and JOURNEY.** You're not late, you're not behind, **you're EXACTLY where you're meant to be.** 

**Keep going.**

**I love you.**
