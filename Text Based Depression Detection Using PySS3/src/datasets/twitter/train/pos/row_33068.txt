/r/EmotionalSupport is here for you! Please join us at r/EmotionalSupport! This is a place I am hoping to revive so people can get *genuine* help about actual problems in their lives. I personally reached out to the creator to become a moderator so I could try to promote a place where people can get help and comfort.

If you're looking for a safe place on reddit, please come over and join r/EmotionalSupport!
