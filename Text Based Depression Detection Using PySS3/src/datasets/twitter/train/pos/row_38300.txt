r/teenagers podcast update Iâ€™ve posted this before and got positive feedback, so I have to decided to do it. I am making a r/teenagers podcasts that airs every week, where we talk about mental health, school, home life and everything in between. If you are interested to be a part of the production team or a host, just dm me on here :)
