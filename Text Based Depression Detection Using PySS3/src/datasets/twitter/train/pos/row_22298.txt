Ok help me out here....Will SAO have a season 4 apart from Progressive? Cuz it said â€œ Kirito will returnâ€ and it said that all three of them are going to fight a big war and whatnot. Or is â€œKirito will Returnâ€ a hint towards progressive since it was announced in the same day of the last episode of season 3?
