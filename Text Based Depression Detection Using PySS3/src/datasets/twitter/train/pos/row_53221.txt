I will never get people like this Well when I was with my first boyfriend everything was going on pretty well until he had some stuff to do and I had to entertain and take care of myself. One evening I was alone and accepted a followers request from someone I thought this wholesome looking girl has great potency to be a new friend. But it wasn't a girl it was a guy who had his best female friend as profile picture (why would you do that?) and he started liking all my pictures expect the ones with my bf and commented stuff like hearts under my professional pictures. And he added me on snapchat and started snapping videos of him Â¿twerking? shirtless, nah it was just some cringey shit. He started a very frustrating conversation and I tried to give it a more frienship like vibe, by talking about my boyfriend, school and other stuff like him. But he kept trying to flirt (and probably to fuck too) that I just said: "You know I am in a relationship, right?" Which he replied to with: "Your white boy?" with a mocking undertone, dating a white person meant to him that I was single to him and then he started talking about that he could never smack a white person and I said: "And so could I never smack a black person, so do we all have our preferences!" But he didn't mind what I said and came with a lot of other statements that made furious.

-"Snap me when you break up with your *white* boy"
-"You can introduce me to daddy too"
-"Promote my Lomotif video on your story" (with the intention that I would treat it the same way like I did with boy's thriller)

The next day when I was done doing stuff he immediately come up with that he wanted to get promoted by me and started replying to like every story I share and when he insulted my boyfriend one last time I had enough of it and blocked him.
