why did my brain reminded me this horrible memory so in 7th grade, this girl tried to kiss me because of a dare. and i didn't want her to kiss me, so i told her NO. but she kept chasing me and and her friends helped her too. at some point, i got so mad that i was about to slap her but i didn't, instead i yelled at her â€œWHAT ARE YOU FUCKIN GAY!? STAY AWAY FROM ME!â€. and this girl started crying. at the end, I HAD TO APOLOGIZE. WTF. i was really mad that day. im not homophobic but why would i want ANYONE to kiss me, especially after i told them not to.
