Iâ€™m I may my good fellows I do hope I donâ€™t insult any lads or lassies whilst Iâ€™m here amongst you but I ( an American) have found it rather maddening that people believe that all of us jolly Americans shcalops think itâ€™s okay to joke about the day that the generations before my parents unleashed the suns upon the innocent souls of a foreign nation ( tho if I must the Americans were reacting out of pure anger for Pearl Harbor and to me thatâ€™s still and exaggerated reaction ) however itâ€™s not okay the joke about the day which over 2000 innocent souls lost their lives to some pansies with a death wish. Now I for one hate both subjects, why? Because they both to this day incite conflict and confusion and ainâ€™t nobody got time for that. I do not joke about the years which one man thought himself higher than once denomination of people and sought to slaughter them all for his pure statisfaction, I do not joke of the tens of thousands of men, women, and children, American, Jewish, Asian and so on. For to joke about these things are not right and not acceptable and quite frankly you shouldnâ€™t either. What I am trying to relay to you chums is that not all the  blasted. hypocritical, scum Americans are the same. I do not take responsibility for the actions of my ancestors for that is in the past and I will remain there for those people are dead and gone, we are here and now and itâ€™s up to us to make the decision to either dwell in that dark past, or move forward to the future where there is room for change.

I didnâ€™t come here to make those affected by any of the events I mentioned offended if I have then Iâ€™m sorry.
