am I actually one of those woke white girls like ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ basically long story long ðŸ‘‰ my brother has a crush on my mumâ€™s friendsâ€™s daughter right?
And they came out as trans. So they were born a girl and now identify as a boy. And &gt;he told my brother they were trans, and then my brother told me and my mum. And we were having a talk about it, and they were still calling &gt;him a her and by his birth name, and I just mentioned to be careful with pronouns like so you donâ€™t cause gender dysphoria, i was the only one calling &gt;him a him and by their new name and they said something like, â€œ Iâ€™m pc and trying to be woke â€œ, then they asked me if Iâ€™m still a cis girl, and like??? I just trying to get pronouns right and apparently this made them think Iâ€™m trans / that Iâ€™m woke likeee fuck this house ðŸ˜â—ï¸
