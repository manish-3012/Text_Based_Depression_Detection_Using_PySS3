I kind of feel like life has no purpose Iâ€™ve been thinking about it lately(actually have thought about this earlier). I donâ€™t have any hope that I can become what I want to become, if I donâ€™t, I will have to go in another direction In a completely different way. One part of me is saying that I need to successful and the other part of me is saying that I only need a decent life(going to job 9-5 and coming home).If second one happens, I have no idea what to do. I just need to let go of everything. I feel like I didnâ€™t exist. This feeling eats me everyday ):
