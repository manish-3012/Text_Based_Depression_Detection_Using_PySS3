I seriously need to start making friends at school So im a freshman now and am in high school and most of the kids in my middle school went to a different high school. So my friends are less and I onky have class with one of them. I also am in Marching Band and have friends from there but only 2 of them have the school say Covid schedule as me and one of those is at the stem academy half the day and I dont see him. The other kid is a giel who I'm not yet huge friends with, but am comfortable around mostly. So yeah, I really need to make some more friends.
