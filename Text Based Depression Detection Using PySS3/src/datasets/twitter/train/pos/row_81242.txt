Teens of reddit, why is bullying towards "weird" or "awkward" condoned in school? Genuine question. I'll admit that I was bullied while also having developmental delays but it feels like most teenagers are okay with laughing at kids who are "annoying" and "deserve it". 

As a teen, I hate stereotypes, but it just feels so common. Most people are willing to laugh and hurt this person's reputation even more but very few are willing to address the problem to the person or mention to them that they are annoying. 

If you have witnessed this or have done it yourself, why do you personally think it happens?
