I've got a question for those who doesn't study, but still gets relatively high marks Do you feel like you are cursed or something? I do. I am one of those people.

Everytime I get an assignment I do it the night before or the last second, I would have said the same with studying but I rarely hit the books.

While everyone is studying here I come along, someone whom hasn't studied, getting the best marks in class.

Some may think this is a blessing, but I do not agree. My work ethic is almost at zero, if something is not so easy to get, I almost instantly get frustrated or uninterested with it.
