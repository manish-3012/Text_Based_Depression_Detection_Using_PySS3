Asking my crush a question, need advice. So I was thinking of asking them on snap, "hey, you seem like a good person to ask this to, if I want to message my crush what's a good starter?" And if they respond with something I'll turn it around and use it on them. Is this a good idea? Is it to cheesy, or weird? Plz help me.
