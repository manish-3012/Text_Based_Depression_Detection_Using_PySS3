Is this poem good? If yes then I'll post more poems. Rising Hours

Oh, so beautiful
is the morning sky,
My whole world rocked
by this spectacular sight.

The orange streaks 
with the fluffy clouds,
Start my day
with stunning beauty.

The calm, composed sea
breaks the rocks, 
And my soul
with it's rhythmic melody.
                                                
                                             -Stindrt2
