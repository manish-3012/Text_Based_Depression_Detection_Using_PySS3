I hate school life I hate when people tell me that I am lucky when I score a good mark on a test. Like bitch I have studied for it. I have worked hard for it while you were sleeping. If ever one gets a bad mark, they will blame the person for not studying. They won't ever mention luck. I also hate when my parents don't appreciate my marks even though they are pretty good. They act like they were the most intelligent person at their school. Smart kids (I am not that smart but...) at school deserve to be appreciated. Like they have it hard. Basically the school system sucks...Smart kids are no longer appreciated...you are only appreciated when you are good at arts or you have a certain talent. I just hate school life. People tell me that school life is the best life but it is the best life when you have friends or if you are talented.
