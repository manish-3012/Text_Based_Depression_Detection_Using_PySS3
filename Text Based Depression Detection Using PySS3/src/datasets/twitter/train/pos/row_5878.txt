Sweden, a tool to further your political agenda At least in America people always use Sweden to further their political agenda, republicans say Sweden used to be socialist then when they stopped being socialist (they didnâ€™t, they just went less extreme) and there lives improved, social democrats use it as an example of a thriving social democracy and say we should be more likely them, and there right, what did you think I was going to complain about it nah Iâ€™m going to use Sweden to further my political agenda 

But seriously Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and most other countryâ€™s have a single payer healthcare system, and a lot of them are doing great, itâ€™s worth the extra tax dollars
