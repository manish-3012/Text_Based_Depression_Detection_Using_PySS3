stupid_teen.txt For the record, I am aware that this ideology has a few issues, but this is a general overview.

&amp;#x200B;

I call it Transhumanist National Socialism, because it is transhumanist, has nationalistic and socialist properties.

&amp;#x200B;

The basic principal that the ideology builds off of is the idea that humankind needs to focus more on increasing our quality of technology, progressing as a civilization, and working towards becoming a type 3 civilization.

&amp;#x200B;

To do this, a few things are done:

&amp;#x200B;

\-We unite the world under 1 nation, by force if necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The government produces most goods as to increase funding.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Social programs are produced to keep people happy while allowing for reduced wages.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Unhelpful ideals will be silenced. I PROMISE, LIGHT SPEECH POLICING ISN'T THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The government would be a technocracy until we are able to build highly complex A.I. and control their ideals, at which point a dictatorial A.I. would be integrated.

&amp;#x200B;

In this society, I feel we have the best chance as a species of progressing beyond fighting over borders and resources on an insignificant rock, and into a interstellar (or even intergalactic?) empire. We would live in a society where all work is performed by machines as we relax and have our every need cared for.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so what do you think? I think it's a tad extreme, but nothing too bad. It's fairly reasonable.
