true story okay so we all know by now some people are just absolutley terrible human beings most times females and all in the name of "feminism" or"women empowerment" anyway a friend cheated boyfriend multiple times then when the dude she was dating found out she actually had the audacity to say it was his and he should apologize for walking in on them long story short the guy dumped her this girl now came ranting to me about how he was a misogonystic pig who was infringing on her women rights by not allowing her sleep with other men sometimes iam actually ashamed to be of the female gender anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk
