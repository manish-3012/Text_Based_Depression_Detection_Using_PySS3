Do you care about people you don't know ? Try not to lie plz




1- If someone you didn't know at all killed himself, would you care about it ?



2- What if it's someone you really vaguely know ? Like someone who is in your class but you've never really talked to ?



3- What if it's someone you know online ? You can't really consider them a friend, but you know them  and have talked to them for a bit.
