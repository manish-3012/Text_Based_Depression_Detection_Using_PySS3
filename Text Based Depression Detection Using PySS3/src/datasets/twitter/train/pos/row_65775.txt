I think my cat has a girlfriend So I have an orange tabby cat named Hamilton and he's 1 year old. I haven't been able to see him in a while ,but I've gotten updates on him.


Recently my mom told me he's obsessed with a girl cat  that's black and white. He's been doing mating calls for her.


If she's actually his girlfriend, what the fuck do I do if kittens show up on my porch
