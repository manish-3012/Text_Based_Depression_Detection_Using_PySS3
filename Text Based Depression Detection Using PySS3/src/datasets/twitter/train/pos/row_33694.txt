What exactly is the depression y'all post over here? I mean come to think of it, a good deal of posts contribute to this field. And I don't get why a lotta people feel depression, like seriously, c'mon man. Ok what's your basis on this emotion we see so often, cos most posts be like "Hey, decided to end my life today, good bye".

     Did you ever feel some serious shit like this? If so why? Other than having strict parents, comment anything that drives you to the extreme lol
