Im so tired Its 6am and i will go running now. Why? I have no idea. When i come back i'll have to study so much, teachers literally give us test everyday. Fuck teachers. Then i have in person school at 1pm. I think i'll be able to do everything i planned for today. But im sleepy :(

And i wish you an amazing day as well! Dont forget to do your homework. If you arent feeling really good, maybe take a nap, dont stress yourself so much.
