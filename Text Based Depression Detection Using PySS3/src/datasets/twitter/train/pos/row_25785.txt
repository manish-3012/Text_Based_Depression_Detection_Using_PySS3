I wanna buy something on amazon, I need help thinking of what to get though I got 55 pounds right now (might be able to get a little bit more money on there idk)

bit about me so you can help:  
I'm closet bi

I'm 16

am British

single (idk why you would need to know that but eh)

and my birthday was on Monday (yall bring me anything? lol)

and i play the Switch (but only official Nintendo games)

&amp;#x200B;

I would ask my friends but they just say body pillows and dildos (that's why I'm marking this NSFW) so while I'm "ok" with the idea of them I dont wanna have to open a box with my name on it with a body pillow in

&amp;#x200B;

anyway can yall help me think of stuff to get/ save for?

thanks!
