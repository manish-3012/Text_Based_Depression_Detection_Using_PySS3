Why i hate E-girls. To start with, I have a large issue with simps, mainly because its a degrading and leads others who aren't simps, but just like someone, to be called a simp. This is, of course, madness and should be purged from society . The best way to do so is to remove a massive percentage the simps by removing the main source of simping: E-girls who also employ dishonest tactics to receive money. As a result, i feel a strong dislike towards E-girls. I would like to clarify that my definition of an E-girl does NOT encompass all female content creators and internet users, just those who know they can prey upon their audience's wish for attention, or those that use the fact that they're a girl to manipulate people, such as discord mods.

Here we reach our next point: E-girls use their gender to control mods on discord servers to do their bidding, such as ban users and gain privileges, which creates a toxic environment.

As such, to any E-girls out there (Belle Delphine, I'm looking at you) stop what you're doing.
