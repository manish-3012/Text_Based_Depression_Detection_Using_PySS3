My school girl's called me a racist So im from india. And few months ago a girl asked me if we can date and i said no I'm not interested. And then she said atleast you can try I'm having a good personality. But i my answer was no cus i wasn't interested in her and I didn't have any feelings for her. Then she started saying I'm not dating her because of her looks and things. But after she left i got texted by many girls of my class on instagram saying i rejected her cus she was black and not attractive at all.
But that wasn't the case i didn't have feelings for her. 
Any advice cus I'm going to report that girl to my principal after the quarantine ends
