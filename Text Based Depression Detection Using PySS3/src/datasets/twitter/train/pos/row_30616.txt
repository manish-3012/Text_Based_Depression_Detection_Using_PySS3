Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 20: Alexander Graham Bell Bell had a deaf mother, who inspired him to learn the science of sound, and he also had a wife who was deaf, who he invented the telephone to make her happy. Despite this, he had some opinions that they may disapprove of.

He was the president of the International Council of Eugenics. Eugenics is the idea that there should be laws that restrict who people can have children with. In his case, he thought that deaf people should not be allowed to have children. Yeah, never mind that he is the child of a deaf woman, and had numerous children with a deaf woman. 

After he invented the telephone, he became a celebrity on the Board if Educators. He used said fame to push through a decision that he was passionate about: banning sign language from schools. This policy passed (because he prevented deaf teachers from voting on this) and for 100 years, that board had an anti-sign language policy. As you can imagine, deaf students had their literacy rates plummet.
