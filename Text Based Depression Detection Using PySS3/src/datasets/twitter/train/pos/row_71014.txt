How dangerous is it for me to travel 400 Kilometers by a bicycle on mountain roads. It takes around 5 hours by car,

The route is mostly mountain roads, and dirt mountain roads

I Really want to know that, how long will it take, and what will I need,

If I go @ max avg speed with my bike, it will take around 20 Hours, but that's non stop,

What will I need,

And what are the chances of me dying ?
