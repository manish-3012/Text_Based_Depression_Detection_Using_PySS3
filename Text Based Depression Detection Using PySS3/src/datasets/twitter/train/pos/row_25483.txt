I was just in an Among Us game with a person named McNuggy. He was orange, and dark blue was named yamato, and purple was named Red. yamato and Red were battle buddies who pretended to be in love with each other AND EVERYONE WAS SO HERE FOR THEIR LOVE STORY HE WAS DOWNLOADING INSTAGRAM FOR HER WHEN THE SERVER CLOSED DUE TO INACTIVITY. I donâ€™t think I have ever been more distraught in my whole entire life. I HOPE YOU FIND EACH OTHER ONE DAY
