Iâ€™m related to James Buchanan, the president before Lincoln, heâ€™s at least partially responsible for the civil war He was also a bachelor his entire life, thereâ€™s some speculation he might have been gay but honestly I donâ€™t care I still hate him, he was racist 

Idk how Iâ€™m related to him I just know I am. My family tree has been kept track of very well and has been documented back like 10 generations or something ridiculous like that
