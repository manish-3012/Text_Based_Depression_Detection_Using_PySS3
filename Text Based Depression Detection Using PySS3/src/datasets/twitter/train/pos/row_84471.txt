kinda wish i could exchange my skin for a new one idk i never thought iâ€™d live this long and i just feel. ugly and gross and i had a realization iâ€™ll have to live with certain scars my entire life and i canâ€™t fathom the idea of living to an old age and still having them and having to explain them because i can barely handle explaining them now

ðŸ‘ existence is difficult
