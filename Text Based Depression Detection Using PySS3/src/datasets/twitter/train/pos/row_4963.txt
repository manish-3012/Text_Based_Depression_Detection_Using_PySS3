This has to STOP! So let me just start out by saying that,whatever Iâ€™m about to say,has to be said.And yes,maybe you canâ€™t count this as advice.

So,for my fellow teenagers out here,this whole thing where you try to change ur personality,and act like someone ur not just to impress ur crush has to stop,like seriously.

I have seen MANY people who completely act like someone their not just to impress their crush,it honestly doesnâ€™t make sense To me.And tbh,relationships like this donâ€™t even last very long,so thereâ€™s no point in doing this,also at a certain point this can affect ones life.

FOR EXAMPLE: Ur crush isnâ€™t into ppl who study a lot and get really good grades.And u are that type of person,and happen to have a crush on him/her.Now just to impress him/her,he/she tries slows down on there studies and ends up getting marks lower than they used to and isnâ€™t doing so well academically,just to impress the other person. ITS NOT WORTH IT.

Just be patient and wait for the right person to come.
If you stop forcing things,they will come to you.

Anyhow,thanks for reading!
