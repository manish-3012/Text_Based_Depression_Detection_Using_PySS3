Cant understand if she is into me There is this girl I really like, Iâ€™ve known her since middle school, then we lost touch and we only got back to see eachother in highschool, I just finished my third year. Lately during the lockdown she messaged me (She lately broke uo with a guy) and me who was going out with friends, invited her over to the beach. Now Itâ€™s been like a month and we did alot of things together but I still cant understand if she likes me or not. She never looks for me on social networks but I sometimes write to her and try to get to meet again. This evening Iâ€™m having dinner with some of my friends and she refused because â€œshe doesnt like the placeâ€ Iâ€™m pretty sure she is being honest as she talked to me how were weâ€™re going is a place she dislikes. I really dont know what to expect but Iâ€™ll just keep it cool and see If I can organize to meet up sometime. Something Iâ€™ve noticed in relationships is that Itâ€™s very easy to fall for someone and lose interest to your activities, hobbies. Try to avoid that or else you will feel empty and become annoying to the other person.
