Ima try pull my first all nighter rn It's currently 1:20 am, I've tried staying up all night with my best friend but the latest I've gotten was 6 am... Ik, pathetic

I've had a very *healthy* amount of coffee today so that should help, anyone got any tips for staying awake? My parents are asleep so I can't jump around or stuff lol
