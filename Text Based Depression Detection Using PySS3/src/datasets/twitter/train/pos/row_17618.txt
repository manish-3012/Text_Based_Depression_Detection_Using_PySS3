So today was my birthday I wanted to do something with my friend but you know, virus. I used to think it would be over by the time my birthday came but now here we are. So anyway I just rewatched Lord of the rings the Return of the King for the 343th time and I didnâ€™t regret that at all but I just wanted to do something with my friends.
