I have found my happy place. It is important to find a place you feel comfortable at that is not your home. I just realized mine is a coffee shop I walk to every other day after school. Just sitting here listening to Undertale music and drawing anime characters. I'm vibing. 

Find your happy place guys. It will cheer you up and give you something to look forward to besides porn and stops depression.
Take my advice. Pls I hope it cheers a couple people up while it lives it's short life in new.
