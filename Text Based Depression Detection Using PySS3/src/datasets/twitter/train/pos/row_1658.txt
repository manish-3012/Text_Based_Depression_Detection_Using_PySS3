Iâ€™m meeting up with a friend I havenâ€™t seen IRL in 5 years. She was one of my best friends during my first years of elementary school. Then one day our parents got into an argument and we stopped seeing each other. Never even got to say goodbye. I never completely lost contact with her and now that we are old enough, we are going to the mall today. Iâ€™m so excited and so nervous at the same time. Wish me luck!
