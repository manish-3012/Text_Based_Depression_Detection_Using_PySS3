I have no idea what's happening and I don think it's good My mom and dad have been arguing a lot over the past months. Tonight, my dad decided to pack up my mom's work stuff and some of his stuff and put it all in his truck saying he is leaving. (My dad is the boss of the company and my mom is a worker) While he was talking to my mom, he looked at me and told me "I'm not gonna let this affect out bond. I will keep it touch." I have no idea if he's leaving for good or if he is leaving for a little bit. It's very hard for me to understand because of my autism. I have no idea what to do.
