I have been very fortunate in my life. There have been times where I have been sad or  frustrated, and there have been people luckier than me.

But now in my current situation, I feel an existential sadness.

Iâ€™m leaving the house I was born and raised in. I can look anywhere in my house and see a memory. A past me. 

Iâ€™m leaving behind my best friend, a dude who I have known since... forever. I literally canâ€™t remember a time where I havenâ€™t known him.

Iâ€™m leaving behind an array of elementary school friends whoâ€™ve been so kind to me over the years.

Iâ€™m giving this all up for a new chance at a new place. It makes me sad that I will never see a majority of these people again.
