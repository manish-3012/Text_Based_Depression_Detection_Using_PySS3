Texas is a trash state I'm always hearing about how texas is such a good state, but I just don't see it. For one its HOOOOTTT AF here, So much so that you could actually get a heatstroke. I've been trying not to get a tan ( don't like tans) another thing is that, mabye it's just where live, but the schools are super trash, boring, and ghetto. I don't really use the term ghetto alot, but in this case, its very real. I live in Dallas Texas, and I've seen my fair share of fights, diarrhea maggot infested hell hole toilets, and most of all shitty people. And close minded people I should add. I've seen all of this at all the schools I went to, no matter where I moved. The people here are so uppity,rude and unruly, I feel like nobody who hasn't lived here hasn't seen what a true cunt is lmfao.Aside from all that tho texas is just so boring to me. Theres absolutely nothing to do here. Especially with me living damn near on the hills, in mesquite.And I feel like this is the same case for Houston and Austin. At most all I've seen are people riding horses downtown letting everyone know that they're getting married.

Also this is a very nick pick of mine, but it dosent snow here anymore. And I like the snow so that's a downer.

Welp theres my rantðŸ¤—
