Can we stop with the political crap? Just, FOR ONE F#%â‚¬+^~ SECOND!? Like, I want to browse r/pics or r/publicfreakout without being reminded that the past 4 years have been udder shit, and the next 4 years are gonna be udder shit. Did like every single fuckin sub just turn into r/politics when I wasnâ€™t lookin? Itâ€™s real fucking annoying and I donâ€™t give a fuck about any of it. + I canâ€™t do shit about any political situation. Iâ€™m not old enough to vote, and even if I was, no one would give a flying fuck.

Btw, Iâ€™m on Johnny Depps side
