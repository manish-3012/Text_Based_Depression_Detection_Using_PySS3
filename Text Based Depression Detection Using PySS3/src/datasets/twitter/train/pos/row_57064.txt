Yeah, I'm depressed what are you gonna do about it? That's it. Seriously what else did you expect? I'm sad. You're sad. I literally have no motivation to do anything. I felt like everything i did was a mistake. You ever have that feelings where you get yelled at ONE (1) time and you automatically feel like you're a burden and you think you cant do better? Yeah, that's me. My friends literally ditched me when I tried hanging out with them. I literally cannot explain my hatred towards them. Help me?
