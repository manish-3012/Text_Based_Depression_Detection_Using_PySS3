Yubo and suffering from success, I may have fucked up So I am taking to three girls. 2 seem to be friendships 1 seems to have interest in me. However I suspect 1 of the others likes me from the way they act. And the other one has made it clear were just friends. However none of us with any of them are official. So now I'm kinda caught in a web. Kind of a pretzel. I don't want to hurt any of them. I'm not a cheater so I wouldn't let it get to that point. But maybe I'm a little worried about it. Now I'm not a player by any means. This is a product of my passiveness. And not really saying no to anyone. So I hope it sorts itself out and we are just friends and I'm overthinking. I don't ghost people. I like talking to all three of them. 

Idk if I make sense.
