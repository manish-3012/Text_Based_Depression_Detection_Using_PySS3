Several people told me I'm too naive One definition of "[naive](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/naive)" is:

"Showing or characterized by a lack of sophistication and critical judgment"

I can't stop thinking about it. That's actually fair and constructive criticism I got.

I do feel like I've become crude and blunder a lot and that age has done nothing to change it.

Thoughts? Comments?
