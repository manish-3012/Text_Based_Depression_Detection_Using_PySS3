alcohol isnâ€™t a fucking joke the shit destroys lives, not just the drinker

ok so the reason iâ€™m making this post, my girlfriend drinks about once every 2 weeks and iâ€™m worried sheâ€™s gonna get dependent on it, she says she doesnâ€™t feel dependent on it but iâ€™m scared sheâ€™s gonna, drinking at 15 doesnâ€™t usually end well.

ok now stuff that happens when youâ€™re an alcoholic (stuff i know from experience), my mom is a super heavy drinker, her and her boyfriend are always somewhere from buzzed to shitfaced, just the other day my mom was crying to my sister about breaking up with her boyfriend, stuff like that happens all the time. because my mom is always at least a little buzzed sheâ€™s a reckless driver, bruh today she hit a curb going around a corner, her boyfriend is the same way. everyone hates them, and theyâ€™re both full of shit.

i really donâ€™t want my girlfriend to turn out like that, sure alcohol is fun but itâ€™s not really worth it. also, itâ€™s a long distance relationship so thereâ€™s not a lot i can do to get her to stop or at least slow down.
