You're eating chicken that your friend recommended for your birthday, and it's so good... *You're so busy eating chicken that you can't do anything else. Everything falls away: school, stress, social life, memes... all that is left, is chicken.*

*The more you consume it, the more it consumes you. What are words? All you know is chicken. There is no past, no present, no future, no here, no there. Just chicken.*

*Before you know it, you're bowing on the floor to the chicken gods, every time you cluck a live chicken magically appears and falls straight down your throat.*

*And you love it.*

*You grab a chicken as it's falling, you must bring others to the cure that is this delicacy. You tear the skin off your chicken and make ropes, and feed the people who you tie down with all the chicken they can handle.*

*And then some.*

*You've amassed an army of chicken eating fanatics, and you simply can't stop... and you don't want to. Now the chicken is in everything, every surface is covered in the blood and feathers of hundreds of poor fowls. You roll in the piles of chicken that has filled up all the pools and valleys in your city.*

*You see a nuke flying in, about to obliterate your small heaven. It turns into a massive chicken as it hits the ground, and this ten ton chicken explodes, showering everything and everyone in delicious insides.*

*It's consuming the planet, every resource has been forgotten. All shelters are made of chicken bones and skin, every hunger quenched by the raw flesh of the birds, every thirst quenched by the rich blood of millions.*

You wake up with a needle in your chest, you'd been stuffed with a lethal amount of psychedelics and were about to die.

The doctors saved you with seconds to spare.

You shiver at the horror of a nightmare you've just had.

Years later, after a massive amount of therapy and medication, you are becoming normal again, you've had your first night without seizures or horrible nightmares... in perfect time for your birthday!

Your smile turns into horror as you see your mothers gift... as she got you... a bucket of chicken
