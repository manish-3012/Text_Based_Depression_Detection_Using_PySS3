A good friend (hopefully future BF) came out to his cousin today after years fearing his family wonâ€™t accept him And his cousin wrote a long paragraph expressing her support. If you guys could congratulate him in the comments, that would be amazing because he really deserves the support and Iâ€™m so proud of him
