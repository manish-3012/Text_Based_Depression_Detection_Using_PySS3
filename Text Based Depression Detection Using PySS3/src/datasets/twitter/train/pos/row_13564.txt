Guys am I a Psycopath? So the other day I had a real Yoshikage Kira moment. In class we  have to read the book to kill a mocking bird, and that's when It happened. It was the exact page where Mayella Ewell says to Tom Robinson "Kiss me n*gger". As a black kid I've cared when people said the n-word, I mean it's just a word, but this......... bro wtf happened. What's worse is that while browsing the popular page I saw a post with a racist female cop on r/bad_cop_no_donut It happened again, I felt sick. Am I sick? Why am I into racist women, It's as weird as Kira being into hands bro that's just fucked up bro, ught I'm digusted with myself.
