Online school is better than in person school i'm just gonna list the reasons why I think this. no particular order

1. (In my case) starts an hour later and ends an hour earlier than regular school

2. Don't have to wake up at 5:30am to catch a bus

3. Getting good grades in classes I sucked at before online learning

4. Don't have to get dressed cause no one has to see me

5. I can literally do it anywhere with wifi access. Hell i could do it while lying in bed

7. I can sit on the couch and watch Better Call Saul during a zoom class

8. Free to get up and leave whenever I want

9. I can actually get a decent amount of sleep now.



People always hate on online school so i thougnt id provide a different perspective.
