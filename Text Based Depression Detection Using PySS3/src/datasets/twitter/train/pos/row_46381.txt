Awards are fucking useless virtual currency Itâ€™s funny how much people spend money on useless items that donâ€™t do anything but exist and I hate it more how if people would see a post like this then they would be like â€œhaha award go brrrâ€ so donâ€™t do that. Go use that award money for something else like a video game or some shit
