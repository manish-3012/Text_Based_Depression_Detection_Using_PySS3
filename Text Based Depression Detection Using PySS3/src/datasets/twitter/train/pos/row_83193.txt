The Diary Isle Today I was at the super market when I saw this man standing in front of the yogurt section talking to someone over the phone. I had to get something next to him so I heard what went down. Over the phone someone was asking this guy to get Foragers yogurt. These things were RIGHT IN FRONT of him. He looks dead at the yogurt and says to the phone person, â€œTheyâ€™re not here, I donâ€™t see them.â€ And then hung up with a smirk on his face. This devious man.
