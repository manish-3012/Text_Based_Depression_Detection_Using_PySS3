I'm so done with my stupid math teacher So at the beginning of the week, my math teacher sent us a bunch of papers to do by next week because she was supposed to be sick this week. I thought I could just do them this weekend but yesterday at 9.30 pm my fucking math teacher E-mails us that we need to have half of the papers finished by tomorrow because she is going to be digitally in class. None of my classmates had it by then so we had to rush and do it during the break and the worst part about this was that it was a math theme that we had not fucking done before and she just wanted us to do it without her being there or let alone explaining how to do it. The next question we had was how would we get inside our classroom without the teacher being present so we thought we would have to sit in the hall all class. But then low and behold my fucking math teacher shows up who is supposed to be at home because she was sick, we were all very confused as she locks herself into the classroom and sets up the projector. Next, she tells us to go inside and leaves the classroom to go teach us digitally from another room like what the fuck? She even said that she was technically on sick leave and isn't allowed to come too close to us yet she is walking through this packed school. The class basically completely fails because my teacher didn't set up the pc correctly and nothing works right. So my fucking teacher comes up with this genius idea of pushing math (digitally at home) class to 16:30 (school normally ends at 3 pm). All of my class were of course overjoyed that they could listen to my math teachers incoherent blabbering after school /s. I did not show up to the online class because my nerves were at their limits. But how was your day?
