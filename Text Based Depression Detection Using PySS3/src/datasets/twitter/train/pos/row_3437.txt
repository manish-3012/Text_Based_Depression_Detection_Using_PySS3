Iâ€™m 15 now and sense everyone here is extremely invested in my life I figured everyone should know. As my birthday present consider donating to a charity for something not awful. No churches or political organizations please. Have a Helter Skelter thursday with a small push for White Album. Peace and Love.

also if anyone has any tips for correctly 15ing please leave them below in the comments ðŸ‘‡.
