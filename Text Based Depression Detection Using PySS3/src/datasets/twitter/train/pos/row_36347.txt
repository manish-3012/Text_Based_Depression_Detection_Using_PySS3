Are these classes normal? Ok so I just got my school schedule and I have a major concern. I'm supposed to be taking Geometry and Algebra II in the same year. I have Geometry in my first semester and Algebra II in my second semester. Is it normal to take these usually full year classes for just a semester and will I be getting full credit for the classes? So far I am the only person in my friend group and other people I know to have this double math schedule and I don't know if it was intentional on my schools part. On top of this I have AP government also so I'm kinda scared this year is gonna kick my ass. I don't mind taking the double math classes but I'm confused on why Geometry and Algebra II (Which usually you take for a full year each instead of just a semester) are put together in just one year on my schedule. Is it a good idea to take them both in the same year or should I ask for the normal course? I have already reached out to my counselor with no response so far
