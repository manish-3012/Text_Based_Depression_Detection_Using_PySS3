Guys my friend is really shy and started a youtube channel. He said he'll continue if this video gets 50 likes. I really want him to continue, and please help my friend get 50 likes so he continues. It's an among us gameplay video. (I made the thumbnail for him). He's very passionate about this but someone recently told him that he'll never be successful and he's planning to ditch youtube after only one video. I don't want him to get sad, so please help me.
