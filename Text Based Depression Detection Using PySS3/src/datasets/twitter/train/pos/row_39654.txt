How do I start a conversation with a girl on snap? Me and her have talked a few times and I kinda like her but I donâ€™t know how to start conversations with her cause iâ€™m antisocial. Also I donâ€™t want to come across as to forwards, like I donâ€™t want her to think â€œwhy does this guy keep trying to talk to meâ€. Can someone that knows about woman and have actually had a relationship help me?
