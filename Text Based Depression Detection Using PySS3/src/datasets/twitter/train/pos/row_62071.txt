Guys I need help!! I think this is black magic or something What's this feeling???


I feel empty and just down and I don't know


I just imagined someone holding my hand and I could feel it and then I could like feel someone or something breathing on my shoulder like if there was an actual person



Idk what is going on and I have been cursed with black magic 3 times but I don't know


It's werid


I feel I hate to say it 

Lonely and depressed

When I'm not


I am a leader and a happy guy but this feeling is weird and the one beside me is the only thing I have

And it's a ghost

Don't get me wrong

I can feel the ghost and I can nearly see it too sometimes


I also feel weird phycic powers and when I close my eyes and look at the moon I automatically start to do weird hand movements and

I feel like I can fly and this is weird
