What are your parents thoughts on LGBT? (if you know (or how you think), of course) I feel like my mom isn't crazy homophobic but she just doesn't like the idea of 2 men or women dating, i remember her saying stuff like "i mean, i think that a man should be with a woman, that's how it should be, right?" but she never was completely hating on LGBT or something. Im not surprised considering shes christian and 48 haha.
