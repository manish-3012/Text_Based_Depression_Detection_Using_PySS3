I can't cum... First of all I can cum, its just it takes a very long time. I never really cared about it because I was like that for my whole life but for the past few months it started taking longer. I used to cum in 30-45 minutes when I masturbate but now it takes more than an hour. I can still cum in 30 mins but I have to crush my dick for it which hurts like hell. I talked about it with my few friends and they said that its an extraordinarily long time to cum. But I also want the opinion of reddit. I'm a male and just turned 18. So is this time healthy? Am I becoming sterile?
