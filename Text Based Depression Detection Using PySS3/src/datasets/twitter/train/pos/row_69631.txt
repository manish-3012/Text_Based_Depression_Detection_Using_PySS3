If you have the time, read this, its in a format that so if i wanted to make a book of it i could, its not done, its a journal of sorts, im just having a bad night and wanted to share. This is called my "shit has gone South Google Doc" This is made from a super uneducated 14 year old who was probably an idiot for doing this with this amount of knowledge about the subject, this also just a dump of stuff from my point of view so if anything is wrong, dont correct me ok, if you dont understand yet, your dumb, first off, and second, this is a Google Doc of what keeps me ticking, keeps me going, so dont **EDIT**, **CHANGE**, or **MANIPULATE THIS DOC IN ANY WAY**. This is going to jump around a lot, stay with me ok? Every paragraph is a new topic.

Anxiety is the excessive worry about things that are out of your control, it sucks for someone who has anxiety. (little useless joke there) Anxiety is a bitch sometimes, especially for a caring person, especially them, if they see a friend or family member that starts down the dark spiral, they get worried for them, and start worrying about them for hours on end about what they can do for them, what they didnt do for them. It kills a person from the inside out watching someone who goes down that spiral, but its murder for a person with anxiety. A friend of mine, lets call her Emma, had been hospitalized twice for attempting suicide, and kept thinking about it, it killed me seeing her like that, and she didnt know. I constantly worried that in the morning, or in a week( she was the worst at answering texts) that i would get a call or text from someone telling me she was gone. I hated telling her my problems because compared to hers, my life was a first class ride, but she was the only i felt i could vent to, because my other friends wouldn't have taken it seriously or it just didn't matter as much to them, and talking to my parent just always felt pampered, and was just odd, and more uncomfortable than â€œthe talkâ€. Emma and I had been friends since 1st grade so we had a connection I had with none of my other friends, so we understood each other. But i never really talked about me, call me a simp if you want but i felt keeping her alive was more important than my feelings, anxiety, and frustrations. So i never really chose to bother her much about me, i tried checking on her every now and then. It just killed me seeing her like that though. What also hurt more than it helped was that everything i learned from her about her i kept to myself, which was ON-TOP of everything i was dealing with already, so that probably hurt more than it helped, i had tons of peoples little tidbits about them and depressing stuff, stuff you don't tell many people, on top of my stuff as well. But I felt like I could handle it, and I did, for a while,but eventually I started getting mad that most people came to me for help, advice, to vent, but nobody ever really asked, â€œHey Sam, how are you doing?â€ â€œAnything you need?â€ And that was what hurt the most, and maybe i had put myself into that, im sure i had, but it still hurt that no one ever asked that. Even if they did i would say no im fine, like i said, i don't want to think that im weighing someone down with my problems(10/29/2020 edit: i never wanted to think that I weighed someone down, but I think it was mostly because I didnâ€™t want to weigh myself down with my feelings, I had seen people who embraced them to deal with them, and it never seemed to work, it always made them sad, so I assumed if I never thought or talked about them, I would be fine, that was bull shit.), they aren't theirs, they are mine, let me have them, i never made anyone's problems mine, but i still tried to help if i could or they asked. But back on topic, even if they had asked if i was ok, i would say no, im fine. But then i would know they at least cared, they thought of me. I think what caused my anxiety was that i cared too much for people, when i became friends, i became attached to them, not like a slug or anything, but like, they were my friend, and i was their friend,it was mutual, so if anything happened to them i was going to be genuinely sad. Thats what probably caused mine to start, i was born with it no doubt, but i think thats what ignited it, at least thats what i think caused it, it could have been trying to impress my parent too though, i never really felt like i met their standards, like i still could have dont better, so tried to be better, and by god i knew i met their standards, i fucking knew that, but even knowing that, i still thought i hadnt, like they expected more of me, like i could be smarter, be better as a person, just be better. I have vented to my friends before, but that only helped in that moment, it was never permanent, never.

It's a bitch being the funny kid, the smart kid, and the kind kid aint it. There is one thing they all have in common most of the time, they all care for others, but let others become their priority. My parents always taught me to, never be selfish, because it's just not nice, it's not right. What if i told you that has become my life in a bad way. I'm a smart kid, I'm a funny kid, and I'm the one to lean on. It sucks because the smart kid always helps the other person because they know less than them or don't grasp it, the funny kid is the fake face and the kind kid is the one you can always count on to help. I have all 3 of those in me at all times, the funny part is the fake face that people think i'm ok, the smart part is the part that makes people think i'm better at points, and the kind kid is the one that lets the rest crumble, because it's the one that cant keep up with the other, because it cares about others more. Remember Emma? Well she's the one that got the kinder side the most, I'm the one that cared the most for her( I like to think ) because I always tried to check on her, see how she was doing, see if i still had her. That was my weak side, because i was weak to her, i opened up to her, since i trusted her. She understood my sides. I think she was the only one that did. Being kind is a gift and a curse, I'm sure lots of people understand that, because caring for people is their strength, but also their weakness. I've been hit like a truck by that weakness a few times, not much, but have. It's a strength and weakness because when you care about someone so much, that you can't stand to lose them, and you help them so much, and then they're gone. It's also a weakness because people take advantage of it, they understand how to use the kind kids. The funny parts of me are a fake face because it makes people think i'm pretty happy, he can have a good laugh with people, he's doing pretty good. But really I have a lot of anxiety about what people think of me. I never wanted to be popular but I also never wanted to be at the bottom, so I always cared what others thought of me. Being the smart kid doesn't help either, because with my kind of ego, i always think, this could be harder, let's make it harder by taking the harder classes, the harder problems, what makes me feel smart is when i'm the only one in the room who got it and the next person cant for another 10 minutes. But by being the smart kid, it also makes anxiety fucking sky rocket. Because you always think â€œShit! If i get this wrong im a fucking dumbass!!â€ When in reality you're the only one one right or even close. So you're always second guessing your work, your choices, everything. And it never goes away, even for the slightest moment.

Somethingâ€™s hurt more than you can ever believe, even if they havenâ€™t happened. I can say with complete honesty that I would blame myself if I lost Emma, sheâ€™s my go to, and Iâ€™m here go to. At least I think I am. It hurts thinking about losing her, tremendously. And I live with that everyday, I live with a lot things that I wish my parents would appreciate that I havenâ€™t told them, I know they always say â€œI had it worse when I was your ageâ€ and â€œYour fine, it doesnâ€™t hurt that much'' my first day of varsity weight training absolutely killed my legs, it hurt to walk and it hurt so bad to go down stairs. And they made fun of me for being a wimp, it hurt more than my legs, it hurt more than training, because it came at the personal level, the people I went to, to reassure me it would go away, made fun of me. It hurt. I cried after I was back in my room. I also live the fear that I donâ€™t do enough, Iâ€™m a smart kid, so my parents expect a lot, and I can fulfill those expectations, but no matter what, I feel I canâ€™t do enough, and it could be because I see my dad work while I sit on my ass and play games, or I just can't complete something. I also live with the fact that I have major anxiety, they know that, but I have major fucking anxiety. If Iâ€™m wrong about something, I panic like Iâ€™m gonna die. Iâ€™d rather live with everything I have on my back, than tell people, I donâ€™t want to weigh them down, they are my problems, not theirs, and that might be because society says men can handle, some canâ€™t, most canâ€™t handle all of it. 2 of my friends were suicidal, one of those were hospitalized twice, and I canâ€™t get a girlfriend, which starts to make me think that Iâ€™m worthless, that Iâ€™m nothing to the girls, so I think I must be better, I must become better, but when I think about everything thatâ€™s wrong with me, I get even more depressed and less motivated, because I have so much unlikable things about me, like, Iâ€™m can be a massive dick, Iâ€™m not the most likable person, and Iâ€™m just messed up. So I start to think I donâ€™t need a date, that if I just work, I will get farther in life, but I donâ€™t want that, I see things about relationships and see the couples at school, and Iâ€™m like, I want that, just the ability to have something to hug and watch a movie with, to just have something that I can always go to, that gets me. Just someone to sleep next to, not have sex, just have a girlfriend, that, likes to just snuggle, chill, do nothing, I donâ€™t want sex, I donâ€™t want kisses, I want a genuine hug from someone I love who loves me back. Iâ€™m getting excessive and off topic by now, but I come here to write what I need out, not write a novel.

Iâ€™ve always had this question, because it applies to me, â€œAm I weak because I won't give up, or am I strong for not quitting, for not giving up.â€ And I have never figured out an answer. It puzzles me, because everyday I want to give up, just a little bit, it grows sometimes and it shrinks sometimes. But I never do, because I donâ€™t want to, I donâ€™t want to look weak, I want to look better than everyone, be better than everyone. So I donâ€™t quit, I say,â€There is tomorrow, there is always tomorrow.â€ And there is, it might not be better, but I might not be worse, you never know, until tomorrow.

Sleep, sleep is a common commodity that a lot of people canâ€™t get, I canâ€™t some nights. Nights are the worst and the best time of day for me, when Iâ€™m lying in bed I start thinking a million miles an hour about random scenarios that may or may not happen, who knows? But I also can never sleep from it, because I also get sad at night sometimes, this is mostly when most of my head hits me, the meds just move it back in the day, I always have a point in the day where I am just oblivious and I go into my head, with the meds, mostly at night. I canâ€™t sleep from all that though, because when I run out of scenarios to run, I just lay there, I canâ€™t sleep. Some nights itâ€™s the easiest thing ever, and some nights, most of them recently, I havenâ€™t slept at all, Iâ€™m either up milling around my room, doing stuff from class, and other things. Night time is also my favorite time, I donâ€™t know why, maybe itâ€™s just embracing to me, my ideal night is when itâ€™s chilly enough for a light jacket, have a small mist or fog, starry sky, and, if I had one, my girl, and if not my girl, my best friend, one that gets me, where we can chat for hours sitting on a porch out back at night. That is my ideal night. I wish my room was farther from my parents, just because I canâ€™t sleep at night, then I could get more done, plus it would be nice to not be next to them. The one thing I want the most, for Christmas, my birthday, do you know? Of course you donâ€™t, it might just be me reading this ever. I want that ideal night, where I have a best friend to talk to, who can be fun and serious, who can talk with me, and who I can talk with. Thatâ€™s what I want, someone to talk to, someone who I can communicate with. Then again, quarantine might be getting to my head by now. I have to take the PSAT in the morning, thatâ€™s about 5 hours away. Most of these entries are from around 11 to 2. Never during the day, only at night.

It's been quite a few days since shit has gone south, i think that's a good sign, i miss it though. When things went south, i came here, i wrote it down, and it got out a little bit, but i feel those were the times i thought the straightest, when i actually thought about myself, my life, and just, my head. I learned a new word from a Russian Badger video recently, stoicism, it means to endure pain or hardships without showing or complaining. I want to live by that word, to never show that I'm in pain, to never show that I don't like what I'm doing. I personally think it's a great word, it's a word that I feel I want to describe me, but does not yet, I want it to, I want to be known by people, and when they think of me, they think,â€Damn, is he ok?â€ I want that, I want someone to see that I went through some serious shit, and I'm not showing any emotion, not showing that i'm dying inside, not showing that I want to cry, I want to be known as menatlly strong if nothing else.

Shit went south today. I learned today that I will be losing Emma today, my doggy. She hasn't been in the best of health for the last few years and we have decided to put her to sleep. I've known Emma ever since Susan moved in, she brought Emma with her. I'm really sad about that. 2020 has been a bitch, but it could get worse, way worse. Who the fuck am i kidding. 2020has probably hit me the hardest out of everyone i know. I lost my house to a fire, susan was in a car crash, my house was almost done being rebuilt, then bam, a fucking fire, susan was in a car crash, my aunt was almost lost to cancer, my friend is on the breaking point for sure cause her dad has cancer. And then school was cancelled again because of a covid rise, being in school was the last thing keeping me sane, all swim practice and workouts were cancelled, those helped me. And then I had little light of hope, just a little, and then 2020 had to take that from me by saying i had to give up the dog i had lived with since i was 3. I need a hug, please, that's all i need.i don't want to tell anyone about this. Because then they would say man up, you're 14, deal with it, it was worse when i was kid. I need a hug.
