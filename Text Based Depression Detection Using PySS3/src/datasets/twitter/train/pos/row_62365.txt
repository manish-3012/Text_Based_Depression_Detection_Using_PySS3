I need a bit of advice. So im 18 and one of my coworkers wants to hook me up with her daughter. Me and the daughter both like knives, art, and are family oriented. Ive talked to her and we get along well. But as you can guess theres a catch, otherwise i wouldn't be posting this. Shes almost 2 years younger than me. I know were both still teens, and people have already told me they see no problems, but with the callmecarson stuff just happening somewhat recently, i feel conflicted.
