idk how to feel about this?? my computer science teacher commented â€œdang gurl...you are making these boys look bad...20/20â€ 

for some context my class is mostly boys and iâ€™m one of only four girls. but about the comment, i think iâ€™m just going to ignore it, but how big of a deal is it really? the last thing i want to do is overreact but this just struck me as a little weird.
