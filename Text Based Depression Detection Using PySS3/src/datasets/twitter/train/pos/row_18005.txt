Complaining about the "boys quirky girls boring" memes reinforces the stereotype I mean, obviously gender doesnt have an effect on how fun/boring a person is.

The memes usually build on young males being childish and stupid and girls being more mature and reasonable for their age.  
Complaining about those memes instead of using the format to make fun of boys is reinforcing the stereotype and sucking the fun out of that meme instead of adding to it.  
I think everyone would appreciate some "boys stupid girls smart" or "boys childish girls mature" memes, right?
