Is this normal? I have a 6 yr old brother (the youngest) and out of my 6 siblings, he's the one I most look out for as he cannot form a full sentence yet and depends on my parents, mostly my mom (he has separation issues) lately I've been having really bad nightmares where my mom dies and I see how my brother would react and how I would have to pretend she's still there for him bc every time my mother isn't where he can hear or see her he yells out to her or starts crying, I always stay up as these nightmares leave a sick feeling in my stomach to where I feel as if I'm going to throw up or I'm going to faint it's horrible and I don't know how to stop it because now the nightmares are beginning to worsen to the point where I do throw up and can't sleep anymore. If this is normal, what do I do?
