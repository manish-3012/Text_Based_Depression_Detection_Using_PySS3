I want to make a move but don't know how. As most of you know, Valentine's day is tomorrow, and there is a girl I like, Iâ€™m not sure if I should tell her I like her, ask her on a date, ask for her to be my Valentines or what. I'm a 14M whoâ€™s never been on a date before, only has had an LDR, and no experience in anything like this. My family isnâ€™t really one to talk to each other about this kinda stuff and I would be mortified to talk to my dad about this. Iâ€™m pretty sure she likes me back because I have her snap, insta and phone number and we have been texting for a while. Her friend sent me screenshots of her texting saying that she likes me, and I think she asked her friend to do that.  Should I make my move tmr and if so what should I do, or should I wait to make a plan, and ask her in person after CNY break.
