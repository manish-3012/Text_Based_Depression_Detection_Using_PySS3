Relationship activities? So recently I have been working on self improvement, and trying to to be the best version of myself. I wasn't it the shape that I wanted to be in, and found myself becoming not focused and lazy. I have spent time on that, and recently developing better workout routines, and study habits. Skip to yesterday, I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while. I decide that it is the time, and my boy (who also has a gf) has been hyping me up. For the longest time I wanted to ask her out but assumed she would reject me. I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot, and try to improve from this situation. Anyway, I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased. She said she would love to, and we have been texting a ton since. She said that she had a crush on me too, and I was so glad it worked out. I have been in relationships before, but niether really count as they were just 2 flings. I'm familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago. That wasn't really a relationship either, as the person who asked her never did much, and didn't treat her with much respect. I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently! I really want to have fun with her, and know that I will not just leave this as a fling. I have been thinking a lot about what things we should do together, and since there is a pandemic right now I know it will be difficult. Anyone who has been a relationship with someone (especially in COVID), it would be very much appreciated if you let me know some fun activities you have engaged in with your signifacant other!

TL; DR: I asked a girl who I was into if she wanted to be together, and she said yeah. Now, I'm wondering what sort of activities to do together in a COVID era.
