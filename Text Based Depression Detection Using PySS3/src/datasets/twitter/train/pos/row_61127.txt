All Iâ€™ve ever wanted is just a friend that I can properly talk to and cares about me, would anyone want to be that type of friend? I have no friends. My old friends started hanging out with a mean person who shoves me into the ground and thrashes me on it and does this everyday, never gets in trouble and is taken care of by all the other teachers. Now they laugh at me and the nice ones just stick with the mean ones and now Iâ€™m just a lonely gorilla like I used to be, and always will be. I just want a friend who I can actually talk to. Who wants to be my friend?
