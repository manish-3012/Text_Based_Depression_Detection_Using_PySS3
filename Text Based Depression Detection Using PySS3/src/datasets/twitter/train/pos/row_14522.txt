Private schools are overrated. Fight me. Most private schools are extremely expensive and if youâ€™re in the middle class you probably wouldnâ€™t have as many personal stuff because that money would go towards the private school, most of the kids are real aesholes and since thereâ€™s usually a small amount of people your chance of finding good friends or people you might get along with are low and not only that but the amount of drugs are fucking crazy Iâ€™ve seen crackheads fight each other like a Call Of Duty zombies. 

Rich kids can get their hands on drugs extremely easily. Itâ€™s weird how many of you want to come to private schools for some reason.
