I just had the most wholesome among us experience Man I just hopped on among us with a couple of my friends and with some randoms when two people going by â€˜Jolyneâ€™ and â€˜Tyyyyyyâ€™ joined, and Tyyyyyy(who Iâ€™m gonna call black) started saying he was depressed and such like. When he joined I was the colour black, but he asked if he could have it and I saw no reason to refuse, so I turned to dark green. (Most) of us tried to comfort him and gave our support, one of them decided to call him a stupid ass n-word, which I think was just plain racist, but anyways I banned him being the host, and he seemed to take a liking to jolyne (who Iâ€™m gonna call pink) as they were the nicest one to him. They followed each other around in the games that followed, each of which were really fun, but one of the rounds black just didnâ€™t reconnect and pink seems kinda sad about it. Sadly they left as well a game or two later, but idk it was just really wholesome to see everyone to be so supportive of black when he said he was feeling depressed.

Honestly Iâ€™m sure not a lot of you care about this but I just thought it was something wholesome I could share.

Also, if either of those two are reading, (I was going by the name Jotaro, and was green) Iâ€™d like to give my greetings, and to wish them luck ahead in life.

Tl,dr: I witnessed a super wholesome moment between two people in among us
