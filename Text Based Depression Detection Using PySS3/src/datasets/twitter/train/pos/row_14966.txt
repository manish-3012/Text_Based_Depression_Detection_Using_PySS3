Just a little rant :) Warning, probably spelling mistakes but i don't care

I don't have a super hard life but sometimes what has occured gets me really fuckin down....

Long story short my mother tried to kill my dad and now i want nothing to do with her. But having one parent and no family is hard...

The problem i have been having recently is my dad is my dad and i love him but he struggles being a single parent and i am not the most helpful kid in the world.
I also don't exactly like telling people how i feel since i always feel like they are going to try and put me into therapy or some shit which won't really help in my situation. I'm also scared of making the person i tell feel bad and that i'd just be pushing my problems onto someone else.

I just really would like to know what it is like having a mum that was a mum and not some druggy for once...
We used to have so much fun together and even if she wasnt a good person i enjoyed her being in my life...

But now thats gone and I don't really have anyone else since my family is filled with a bunch of assholes or live in another fucking country

But thats the end of my rant i guess thanks for reading
