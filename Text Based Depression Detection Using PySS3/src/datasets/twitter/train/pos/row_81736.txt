Fake friends and mentally draining I am emotionally weak. I was bullied a few years ago for you know, appearance and stuff. But now, it's almost as if bullying has evolved into a very strange passive aggressive way which slowly emotionally drains you and lowers your self esteem. In also a way that you can't explain how people bully you because its a lot to do with the delivery and a hint of anger in their eyes. This may seem like rambling but look. My 'friend' today, threw rocks at me but in a playfully aggressive way and they stole my shoes from me and y'know what I fucking did. I just sat on a curb and kind of giggled at them and sighed, I just hoped if they thought that I found it funny they would stop. Of course they didn't and eventually they basically blackmailed me. Because I'm so desperate for friends in covid times I agreed. I was about to leave and they said if I leave they would say that they wouldn't come out with me again (so they could use me more and benefit from my things, like they could swap with my bike.) Another quick thing, I've bought them countless fast food meals and guess what I have from them in over a year, 1 dollar/1 pound. I'm just drained and I feel awful. Any advice?
