Iâ€™ve been playing beast and the harlot on clone hero, but now just payed attention to the lyrics. Jesus Christ â€œThere sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked


The beast and the harlot


She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit, every filthy bird
And makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the greatâ€
