Why do you guys do self harm? It literally solves nothing, harming yourself doesnt cure depression. If its because you hate yourself then you're doing exactly what the person you most hate (you) wants to do. There are many other ways you can help yourself feel better, by talking to a friend about your situation (you are always lying to yourself if you say "i dont have friends") or meeting a psychiatrist. cutting your veins like a dumbass wont help at all. I myself would pointlessly harm myself but after thinking about it i realised it solves nothing! Dont hurt yourself during hard times and bear with it, you may think you are right when you harm yourself but looking back now, 2 years later, i was wrong in all the cases


Sorry for my bad english
