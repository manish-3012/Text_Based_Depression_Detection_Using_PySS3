I just had a dream about one of my previous crushes and I realize how much I still like them. I stopped talking to them because it seemed like they didn't care about me anymore. A ton of my friends say that she did that with everyone tho, and now I'm contemplating talking to her again. She's fucking adorable and I really want to talk to her, but.. idk if she's gonna give me any respect. FUCK. This dream rlly fucked me up
