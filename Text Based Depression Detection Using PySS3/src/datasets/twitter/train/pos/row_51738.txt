If you shut down someone talking about something they are really excited/passionate about you are a terrible person. Like seriously. Fuck you. Do you know how hurtful it is to be very excited about something and someone suddenly says to stop? 

If you do that fuck you and ask yourself why is it so hard for you to embrace someone who has a genuine love of something?
