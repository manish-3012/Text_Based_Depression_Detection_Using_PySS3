I feel lonely Ever since we were put in separate classes I felt lonely, but now theyâ€™ve been ostracising me a lot more, and theyâ€™ve barely spoken to me at all.
One of my friends has hardly spoken to me throughout the year and said that it was because of being separated yet she still speaks to her friends from my class (so obviously her excuse is bs) but Iâ€™ve been feeling really lonely lately
