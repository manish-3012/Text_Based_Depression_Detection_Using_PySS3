Is it wrong to like two people at the same time? So I've had a crush on someone for a while now, but today I got put in a group project with someone else and long story short, I realized I have a crush on them as well. I know this sounds stupid but it feels almost like I'm cheating, even though we arent dating. I just want some of your thoughts on this, as I feel like I'm a bad person for liking someone else.
