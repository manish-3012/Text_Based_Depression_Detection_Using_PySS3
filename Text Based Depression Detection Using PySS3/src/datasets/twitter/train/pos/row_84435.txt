Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 37: Douglas MacArthur 1 of 9 of the 5-star military leaders in Americian history, he was labeled a hero for his acts in World War One, World War Two and the Korean War. However, he has something in common with any decent military leader in history.

No regard for human life.

In the Pacific theater, he used lives like he used smoking pipes and sunglasses. This, in combination with his general behavior, made those under him dislike him.

A possible explanation for this was that, like all decent military leaders, he had an ego the size of a mountain. His loss of the Phillipines was humiliating for him. His wish was to die there instead if living with such a defeat. When he was ordered back to the homeland, he blamed everyone, from those under him to the above him, including the president.

When he returned to the Philipines, he declared the fighting over literally at the first opportunity. In reality, pockets of Japanese held their ground until the end of the war. Again, it was his ego that made him eager to undo his defeat so soon.
