I ask for 6 things in 2021 1) A guy who's pretty like a girl and got fight stories to tell. 


2) To be able to see both sides like Chanel. 


3) To go swimming laps through pool water.
 

4) To feel heated like I'm underworld. 


5) To have tattoos that I can hide in Shibuya.

6) To die because I can't make a post without making a fucking mistake.
