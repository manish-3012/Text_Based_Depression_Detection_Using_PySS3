I regret coming out I have been having enough trouble worrying about acceptance with me thinking I'm nonbinary. 

Flash to last night. 

I paint a pair of jeans with my pronouns and the flags on the knees. I go upstairs when I know its only my mom. She looks at the jeans for a while then just stares at me. I tell her what it means and she just says "okay." She then goes on about how I can't tell anyone else in my family because they'll be mad. Not even my brother who I trust more than anything.

I feel fucking terrible and regret even doing it. I don't even care if my mom accepts me if everyone else will just hate me for a fucking gender.
