How talk to girl There is this girl I see walking to school most days. We live nearby and walk the same way and have gone to the same school for a long time. Despite this I have never talked to her or been in any of her classes.

I think she is really pretty and would like to get to know her but I never find myself in a situation to strike up a conversation. When I see her walking she walked about the same pace as me and I am already a fast walker.

I have her Snapchat because she added me on quick add a few months ago but neither of us have sent a single thing to each other. Would it be weird to say hi out of the blue and compliment her hair or something? How can I start a conversation with her?

I am not that great with girls so pls help me out here :P
