Why do teachers get so mad when I'm sleeping in class I'm just trying to sleep, leave me alone I'm not bothering you. Seriously though like teachers come up to me all mad telling me not to sleep and then get mad when I tell them I didn't sleep all night. Let me be.

I will never understand why we can't wear hats/hoods either. In the past they would say it was so they could see our face and know who we are, now we wear masks so what's the mask doing.
