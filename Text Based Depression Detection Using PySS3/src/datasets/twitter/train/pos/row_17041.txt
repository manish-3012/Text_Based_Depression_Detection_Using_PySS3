After 15 years of life, I finally found a boyfriend. We've seen each other online for a couple months now, but we've never really talked until a couple of weeks ago. He's a really sweet guy, in case you're wondering. I never even thought I'd be able to get into a relationship, but here I am. Are you proud of me, guys?
