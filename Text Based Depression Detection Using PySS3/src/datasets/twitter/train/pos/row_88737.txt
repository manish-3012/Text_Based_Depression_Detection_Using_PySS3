Teaching of LGBT in primary schools. I wanted to know the opinions of individuals here in regards to education in primary schools on the subject of LGBT.

Me myself did not go through that when I was in primary school (im 19) I have never had any negative thoughts towards gay/lesbian/trans people. I just followed mind your own business and don't judge others without knowing about them mindset. These are the points I think should be taught personally rather than putting a lot of emphasis on LGBT people. Like I don't have time to worry about Tom liking Ben they can do whatever. But the fact that the primary schools are introducing LGBT "Relationships" education which wasn't necessary before, like how many of us grew up to be homophobic or transphobic? Kids should rather focus on who they want to be in the future and receive education that correlates to those dreams rather than learn about social issues.

But these are just thoughts that I wanted to share.
I want to hear others opinion on the subject.
