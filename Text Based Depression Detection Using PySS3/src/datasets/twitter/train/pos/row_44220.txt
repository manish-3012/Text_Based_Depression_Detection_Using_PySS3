Why do yâ€™all guys where freakin short shorts in winter... itâ€™s 30 degrees F outside and you choose to wear short shorts and a t shirt...tf is this another stupid trend. and better yet itâ€™s almost always the â€œpopularâ€ kids. Like i stopped caring about other kids and popularity but iâ€™m genuinely worried for these people, like are you not hurting? same thing goes for girls who were short shorts that are invisible because theyâ€™re wearing a XXXL dad shirt.
