Any Finnish teens out there? So I'm looking to make some friends from Finland! I'm a Christian and a few years ago I started feeling like God was leading me there. I'm in the U.S. So my mom suggested I try to make some Finnish friends. I'd love to learn more about what it's like to actually live in Finland! And ofc we can talk about other stuff too. I love music and writing. Also I'm really into U.S. state trivia! You can pm me or leave a comment. Also I recently turned 17 so if anyone's interested I'd prefer you be like between 15 and 18.
