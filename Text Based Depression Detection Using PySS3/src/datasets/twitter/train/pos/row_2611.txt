Fellow teenagers of Reddit. This is a bad way to live my life? Or is this completely relatable and normal? People always told me shoot for the moon and if you miss, you'll be among the stars. But anytime I shot for the moon I missed I was among the stars for a little bit, but then I found a cluster of antimatter and was annihilated into photons, and created a chain reaction that destroyed the entire universe. So I just never try any more and lost all motivation to do. Is this a bad way to live my life?
