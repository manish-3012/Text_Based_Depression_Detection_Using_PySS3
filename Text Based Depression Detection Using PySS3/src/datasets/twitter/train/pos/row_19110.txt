Advice on Clowns, from a clown - You can actually send mixed signal to us. You donâ€™t have to blatantly say to us â€œClowns are so creepy, I HATE CLOWNSâ€


- Donâ€™t assume we became clowns because we have nothing better to do. 
I personally was accepted by Harvard to study medicine but I chose clownery instead


- Thereâ€™s this myth that all clown have big penises, thatâ€™s just false, most clowns have average or small penises.


- Donâ€™t say â€œDrop the act Seriously, this is ruining our relationshipâ€ to your clown SO just because you are insecure about being the less funny one.


- Us clowns work really hard in life, graduating from Clown Collage is no joke, so tip a clown when you laugh.
