I havenâ€™t grown in a while my height for my age is off the charts (not in a good way) so itâ€™s to late for me to get growth shots since Iâ€™ve already stared puberty. I have found that I havenâ€™t been eating that well lately so Iâ€™m changing my diet completely to help my growth, and letâ€™s hope it works. The tough part is that I have a gluten allergy and on top of that a dairy allergy.
