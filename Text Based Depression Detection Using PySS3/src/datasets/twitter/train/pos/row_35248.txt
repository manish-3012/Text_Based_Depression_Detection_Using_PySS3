Why my ex pisses me off Alright, here we go, this is gonna be fun. 

(Background: I asked a friend Iâ€™ve known since Kindergarten to be my gf in January of 2020. She said yes.)

She then proceeded to break up with me on Valentineâ€™s day, and didnâ€™t speak to me for 3 1/2 months when I asked a friend of mine to tell her I wanted to talk. 

We talked for a bit, and she said she was sorry and that she wasnâ€™t in the best frame of mind, but I call bullshit on that. We didnâ€™t really talk for a while, then I just decided that Iâ€™d try and work things out. She thought I was being too persistent, but I was only messaging her once or twice roughly every three or four days. We started getting a little more chill (this was around Thanksgiving) so I asked her what she was doing for Thanksgiving, and she said she was going to her cousinâ€™s house. I asked her a couple days later how her Thanksgiving was, and she blocked me.

If I ever run into her, I really wanna make her pay.

TL;DR- My ex broke up with me on Valentines Day, we talked a couple times over the next 6 months, then she blacked me after I was being polite and hasnâ€™t talked to me since.
