Just realized that college professors are genuine monsters and that we're nothing more than fucking machines to them. My friend's grandma died and now they have to move back home....which is in a different fucking. Them and their family moved in with their grandma permanently so they have so much stuff to take back. They also have to deal with rituals and their fucking emotions. We have two models which require a lot of research, trying and testing that have to be completed by Friday. They asked our prof for an extension and he literally told them that they should work overtime before  moving back. He said that he would cut marks for whatever is not submitted. He said that he's only concerned with her academics. This world is disgusting....uwu you are weak and unfortunately for the race if you have different needs. I'm just really angry.....idek how to fucking go on.....our profs keep calling us lazy and say that we complain too much because uwu we have a pandemic rn and all we do is work, and worry about work. We have turned into mindless zombies. Everyone deserves therapists rn.
