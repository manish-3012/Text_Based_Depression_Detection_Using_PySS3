I hate how kind my mom is being A month ago she was yelling at me because I said I didnâ€™t feel safe at home. Now sheâ€™s all lovey dovey and for some reason cares about what Iâ€™m doing. I started learning spanish and Japanese and usually she just makes fun of me for liking other cultures but recently sheâ€™s been all like â€œSo howâ€™s your japanese been?â€

And itâ€™s not just her. When I showed my dad this new program I found for making music he was all like â€œCoolâ€ but it was clear that he didnâ€™t give a shit. Now heâ€™s all like â€œArE yA wInNgInG sOn?â€ (Not really but you get the point). Iâ€™m mad at myself for being annoyed by this. I should be happy that my parents are being nicer. But the problem is that Iâ€™m not happy.

This is kind of why I hate myself. I just canâ€™t be happy.  I feel like a brat.
