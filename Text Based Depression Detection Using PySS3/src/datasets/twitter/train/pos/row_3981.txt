I'm scared lately I've been seeing videos of these legendary guitarists ya know Steve morse, Dave mustaine. and all of them are talking about how their fingers are giving in I just can't help but feel sorry for them. I can't stop having anxiety about the day I realize my hands are giving in and I can't play. it's really hard to accept.
