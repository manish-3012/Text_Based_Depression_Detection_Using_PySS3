Worst week of my life Wish i was dead. I smoked 5/6 days so far, lost my friends, argued with others, have been a dick to my family members, was sick, recieced homophobia, got yelled at, wasted a lot of money, cancelled plans with people, and now my best friend might have covid and Iâ€™m fucking terrified from her. God, I just need a hug.
