What does it mean when a guy does this? he can text me one day and then stopped texting me the next day

he thanked me for being his friend even though it didn't work out but because he sent *that* message we started talking again and now no messages from him again?

bruh

i mean maybe he just want to see if i texted first, but you know i never do because i'm scared to reach out to him again or show him attention again after all the pain he caused me.

i'm cool with being friends with him again but i don't want to be the one always checking up on you or being challenged to see if i will text first lmao.

i miss him putting the effort to text me.
