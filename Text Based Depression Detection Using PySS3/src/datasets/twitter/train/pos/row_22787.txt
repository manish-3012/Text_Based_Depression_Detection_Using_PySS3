I cannot decide what game to buy I'm on xbox, I really like the dark souls series, sekiro, for honor, fallout series, elder scrolls series and battlefield 1

I've compiled a list of games which I think i'd buy, but I dont know which one to get out of the list

Wolfenstein II: New Colossus 

Assassin's Creed: Odyssey

Metro: Exodus

Red Dead Redemption 2 

I'm leaning towards Wolfenstein or Metro but I'm not sure, so I'd like thoughts on the games and recommendations on which to choose, or even recommendations for different games
