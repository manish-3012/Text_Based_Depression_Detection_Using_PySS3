Im going to ramble for a bit Don't you just love it when you sit down and try to focus on something but you can't so you open a bunch of different apps but can't stay on one for very long before your brain tells you to move again and you go back to what you were trying to do but you surprise surprise can't focus on it still so you stop and close your phone and rock back and forth for a bit and just try not to hyperventilating because you don't know why you're freaking out and you just claw the fuck out of your arm to try and calm yourself down and not lose your mind completely 

just me? 
No? 
I hope y'all are okay 

Time to go and do the thing I was trying to do before
