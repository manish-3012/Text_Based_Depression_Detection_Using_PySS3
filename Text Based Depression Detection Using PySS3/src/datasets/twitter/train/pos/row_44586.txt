Eviction notice. The [Eviction Notice](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Eviction_Notice) is a [community-created](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Steam_Workshop) [melee weapon](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Weapons#heavymelee) for the [Heavy](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Heavy). It is a pair of [brass knuckles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brass_knuckles) with a flat grip and spikes on the bands.

While the Eviction Notice is the active weapon, the Heavy moves 15% faster at 88% base movement [speed](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Speed), a rate of 18 km/h. In addition, the Eviction Notice grants a 3 second speed boost upon hitting an enemy, similarly to the [Disciplinary Action](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Disciplinary_Action). The Heavy's speed with the Eviction Notice deployed combined with the on-hit speed boost totals at 119% movement speed, a rate of 24 km/h.

The weapon itself has a 40% shorter attack interval than the [Fists](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Fists), allowing the Heavy to fire punches almost twice as fast. However, it deals 60% less damage than the default Fists, making its overall damage per second 33% lower than the Fists.

The other downside of the Eviction Notice is that the user's max health is drained by -20 when switching to it and while the weapon is active at a rate of -5 health per second. The user's max health will not decay below 100. This health is regenerated while the weapon is holstered at about +5 health per second. As this occurs, the user's current health changes in a way that keeps their health percentage constant; a Heavy at half health will remain at half health no matter how this weapon modifies his max health (aside from rounding errors). The user's max [overheal](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Healing#Overheal) is also reduced when deployed, remaining at 150% of the user's current max health and 125% when using the [Quick-Fix](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Quick-Fix).
