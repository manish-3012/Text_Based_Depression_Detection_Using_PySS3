My parents don't know that I don't believe in God yet, help! I live in an LDS household, but I've found that I don't believe in God and I don't want to be part of an organization that shuns LGBTQ+ people and I don't know how to break it to my family. Please help me, I don't want to pretend to believe in God for four more years.
