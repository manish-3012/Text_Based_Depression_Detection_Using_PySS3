Why the fuck isnâ€™t most surgery/medicine free for us and funded entirely by the government Like wtf?! They fund police, the fire department, the military, science, so much shit but not healthcare, which probably could save more lives than any of those combined.

Like any mental health care, surgery, prescriptions, and rehabilitation should be free and paid for by taxes (to an extent - I donâ€™t want to pay for Melaniaâ€™s millionth plastic surgery or anything like that). 

It is the duty of the government to protect their people, so letting people die because theyâ€™d rather get buried six feet under than call a cab because they canâ€™t pay is in-fucking-sane. 

Idk about other countries tho, this is really only talking about the US
