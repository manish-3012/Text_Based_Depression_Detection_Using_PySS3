I get so embarassed when receiving compliments So basically I'm making this whole post bcs my guy friend keeps calling me cute even tho I told him not to say that countless times,and he keeps insisting it,he doesnt seem like he's joking,,I feel,,overwhelmed

And also embarassed by that bcs I dont have the confidence or enough self love to reply back "oh thanks" or "Haha yeah ik" bcs I would literally put myself down and say no my ugly ass?No way.I am not.

And when I keep denying it and tell him not to say it bcs i get embarassed he continues again and says that me getting embarassed is also cute,I'm??i would seriously punch him istg but ofc I'm not doing that I just get so embarassed I feel like dying

Idk srsly I cant stop him anymore and he told me that he would keep doing that until I admit it myself :\
