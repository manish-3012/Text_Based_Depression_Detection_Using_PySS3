People Suck I just came back from fixing my neighbor's fence gate after someone thought that they could yank the living shit out of it because my neighbor had a BLM sign on it. The gate was pulled of its hinges and was literally hanging by a string. Like wtf? My neighbor is an 86 year old retired art professor trying to live out the rest of his life in piece. He makes spray paint art and lives with his girlfriend for God's sake. Like, leave him alone. 

After the asshole broke his gate, my neighbor put up a sign asking for peace. We live in the conservative area of the city, so I can't say I'm super surprised by this, but still. Weither your on the right or left, democrat or republican, just leave people alone and live your life. Just because someone is in support of something that you don't agree with doesn't mean you have to be an asshole to them.

TLDR; People can't just leave an old dude with a BLM sign alone and decide to break his fence gate.
