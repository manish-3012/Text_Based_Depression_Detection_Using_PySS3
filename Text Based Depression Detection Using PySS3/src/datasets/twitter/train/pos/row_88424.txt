Please stop glorifying stuff like being behind on school work, cheating on tests, procrastinating and being sleep deprived. There's a difference between just ranting about it/asking for help and advice and saying stuff like "im part of the gang now".

 Lets face it, school is important.

If you see a post about people asking for help and advice on such stuff, please don't say stuff like "you're one of us now". Try to provide actual advice instead

Being sleep deprived and not catching up on your homework isn't something to be proud of.  


im not poking fun at people who have problems with academics, im one of them too. but i hate how everyone keeps acting like its normal to sleep at 4 am and get shitty grades
