Condolences to anyone for Beirut I love anything to do with war, including explosions. So generally I would marvel at any sort of explosion but the explosion that happened at Beirut is beyond anything I've seen. An explosion of that magnitude is probably the worst accidental civilian explosion I've seen outside of a war zone. I'm sure there's others that has happened close or even more extreme than that. But the shear mass destruction both the initial explosion and shock wave caused is beyond what I could imagine happening to my city. My condolences to anyone who has lost loved ones and to those still suffering.
