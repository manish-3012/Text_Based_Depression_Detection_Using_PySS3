gn to all my folk who feel empty all the time with no emotional outlet due to lockdown restrictions ðŸŒ™âœ¨ idk if I can take this next lockdown to be honest it's really difficult especially bc I dont have my own room and we were meant to be going back to school and seeing my friends but instead I'm at home disassociating multiple times a day and uncontrollably day dreaming. or whatever night guys get some sleep you deserve it &lt;3
