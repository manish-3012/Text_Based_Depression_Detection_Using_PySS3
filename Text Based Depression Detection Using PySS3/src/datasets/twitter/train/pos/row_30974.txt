Literally just existing on the Internet as a young girl is terrifying I'm definitely not saying it's any better for guys, but I posted my face yesterday for the first time and woke up to 39 very lovely messages including two dick pics, someone asking me to be their sugar baby, someone asking me to sell them my socks, two people asking for nudes, three people asking if I'm a virgin/"how far I've gone," and someone asking to be my foot-licking slave.

It's even worse on Discord and Kik, and I deleted Omegle months ago bc I don't wanna die.

Even just mentioning my gender/age can generate some pretty creepy DMs.
