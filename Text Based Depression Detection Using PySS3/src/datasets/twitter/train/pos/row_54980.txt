I think I'm in love with my ex... Backstory: 

We dated when we were 9 and 10 and have known each other for over 4 years. We are really best friends right now. 

What happened today:

At school, we were with our other friends and took a ride down memory lane and looked at our old texts. I then thought of the great times we had. Watching the fireworks on 4th of July, our first kiss that was in front of the entire school, and the great times at water parks. 

Realization:

Then I remember that we only broke up because we thought we were too young to date. She even said that we could try again in high school. WELL HERE I AM NOW IN HIGH SCHOOL. It was today that we saw this. Today was the day I thought of everything. 

Right now:

I'm currently debating on making the move, just like she did to me those four years ago. I was gonna tell her friends, but that you be to risky so I'm asking you guys.

What should I do? Should I just keep this a secret? Should I tell her my feelings and hope for the best? Should I wait?
