I could be the best past time youâ€™ve ever had TLDR: Pretty fun guy with tons of free time and I wont ever ghost! Respectful, sweet and knows boundaries, single as hell and pretty creative

Heyyy, Iâ€™m 17M, and well I have too much free time! Iâ€™m looking for a friendship but mostly more, I want to connect and see where it goes! Iâ€™d prefer female friends because Iâ€™ve never connected with a guy in my life online, other than my 2 best friends who I met irl! Iâ€™m pretty fun, and pretty ugly, I love soccer and cricket, and am pretty active, and well anything else hit the chat button :)
