Reading old Dr. Seuss comics is weird Sometimes they're incredibly racist (particulary against asians) and sometimes it's kinda based

Like in one comic he'll say how "America First" is a fascist slogan, or that people look away when foreigners are killed in other countries, which do be true 

But some of his comics are incredibly racist that I don't even want to share them

Apparently his views changed after a visit to Japan but idk
