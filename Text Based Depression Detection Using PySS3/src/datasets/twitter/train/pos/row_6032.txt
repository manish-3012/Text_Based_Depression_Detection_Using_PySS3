I dont have big problems Im a going to be 17 male currently studying product design. I frequently see discussions and confessions here on reddit saying they have clinically diagnosed mental issues or emotional problems...serious ones. Others like abusive  parents helicopter parents and coping with their trauma etc etc. I feel bad for them and feel how unfortunate they are. 
I dont have any problems as big as these. I live in a average income family, have a fair bit of part-time job experience, a group of fun friends, a loving SO and a decently caring family. I cant ask for anything more. I have many things others dont have. 
But sometimes, i feel sad. And i want to discuss it to someone else. I cant. I dont wanna sound like an attention seeker self diagnosing themselves with depression. I dont wanna sound like a pampered kid who cant stand the continuous and unfair nags from my father. Everyone has their problems and mine cant be as big as many others. I feel like i dont deserve support from friends.. i dont even deserve the friends i have now. They are so nice and loving even though they have family problems. 

Idk what i wanna tell yall at this point. 
Is there anyone that feels the same?
Feeling empty and sad then you should probably be?
