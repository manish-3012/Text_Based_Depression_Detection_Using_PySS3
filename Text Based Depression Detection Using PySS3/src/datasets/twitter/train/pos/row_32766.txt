I HATE it when my parents don't close the door after they leave my room Like seriously, JUST CLOSE THE DAMN DOOR after you leave the room. Now I have to get up from my perfectly comfortable (potentially back - breaking) position in my chair or bed to close the door because their lazy ass couldn't do it. And when I tell them please close the door, they sometimes have the AUDACITY to say "why don't you do it" ok then, let's see how you feel if I refuse to flush the toilet the next time after I go into the bathroom. Fucking hell.

But yeah that's about it. Rant over.
