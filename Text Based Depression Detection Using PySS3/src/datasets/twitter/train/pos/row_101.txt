Despite what we will tell you Californians do have an accent Mine is basically standard American, but thatâ€™s cuz I was basically forced into a standard American accent cuz my family would correct me if I spoke in anything but that, so my accent is distinct from most people around me, although thatâ€™s relatively common, but most peoples accent where I live sounds like if a NorCal accent had a slight southern drawl and had the speed and stressing of a valley gurl accent, itâ€™s bazaar and so easy to understand, although the people that stray more towards the valley gurl side are a bit harder to understand 

I do still have a central California accent but itâ€™s not nearly as thick as most peopleâ€™s, they didnâ€™t completely beat (not literally) it out of me
