What would happen if brain swapping was a thing? You know like a surgery you can have where you can swap brains with people.

I thought about this and I could think about two outcomes.

1. You would be in control of and be inside of another body.

2. You would be inside your body with different personality traits and different level of intellect.

What do you think? I think this is one of my more interesting thoughts that I have had.

Anyway have a good rest of your day.
