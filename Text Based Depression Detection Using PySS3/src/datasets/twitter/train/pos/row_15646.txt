Iâ€™ve seen my dads browser history My dad has an iPad thatâ€™s always in the living room, and I had my phone charging in my room and was searching something up while chilling on the couch, and he had the side bar thing open on the bookmarks and I decided to jokingly check his history

It was *full* of p-rn

Nothing but p-rn for several days

Stepdaughter p-rn (thank god he doesnâ€™t have a daughter), choking p-rn, a bunch of types of p-rn.

I donâ€™t even know when he has time to watch it, he sits downstairs most of the night until he goes to bed with my mom in their room, and he canâ€™t jack off down there cause I always stay up later than him and come down a couple times per night for water and letting my cat in the backyard for a bit. Since quarantine heâ€™s never really home alone long enough. 

Iâ€™m just so disturbed by this discovery and Iâ€™m lying awake in my bed because of this
