This is most definitely absolutely not gonna work but if that one girl from Toronto is on Reddit, Iâ€™d love to hear from you Heeeyyyy so context: I was goofing around on Omegle just now and I met a Toronto girl who was super awesome and super fun and we never quite swapped social mediaâ€™s, but I had an awesome time talking to her and itâ€™d mean a lot if I could find her. 

I ainâ€™t gonna name names cause thatâ€™s not cool, but we did a whole song and dance about getting an Uber from my place to yours and messing with a jet and crash landing it, fist fights and scary movies. Anyways, I had a wonderful time talking to her and I really do hope I get to talk with you again. 

Youâ€™re probably most definitely asleep right now but if everyone else on Reddit can help a guy out hopefully I can find you?
