How to easily hide screen &amp; paper from parents? Hi! I just recently became a furry and I know my parents would kill me if they found out, so I have to constantly hide my screen from them. I have trouble doing this sometimes and have to look at furry stuff in one class out of 8 only, I am now also wanting to do physical furry art. Is there any way to easily hide papers and screens from parents or any passersby's / fellow students?
