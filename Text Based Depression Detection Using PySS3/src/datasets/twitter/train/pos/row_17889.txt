I made a best friend!!! Wow, so, uhm, wow. That's the entirety of my feelings about this friendship and her as a person. We hit it off on some writing platform a few months ago (she wrote, I read and commented on basically every chapter), added each other on discord and in just a few months I wormed myself into her inner circle of friends, just as she did with me.

I am amazed. It feels as if I'm on the moon, gazing at the stars, planets and nebulas. Ever since I lost my previous best friend of seven years in 2015, I've been lonely. I rarely had a reason to smile, and I got into a habit of just being blank. Every day I looked at other kids, read books with characters who have these amazing connections, and wished I could have that with someone. And now, I got it. Now I can experience that friendship, albeit online, and it's absolutely amazing. My cheeks hurt with the stretch of my grins, I stifle my laughter in class and I look back on conversations with a fondness.

It's *nice*, in that unbelievable and indescribable way, having a legit best friend. A person who you immediately feel comfortable with, who you know will support you no matter what, no strings attached. It's amazing having this person as your best friend. This person, who is similar to you in so many ways, yet has differing experiences and opinions and thoughts which create fun discussions and great jokes.

I just wanted to rant a little to someone about this, because I can't exactly rant to her and how much she means to me xD
