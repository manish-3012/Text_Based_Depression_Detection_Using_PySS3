This year is annoying as hell I fr dont know how this happens to me, but every week i try to do all my homework on time. I dont procrastinate, but for some spiritual inconcieveable reason i still had to make myself a page long bullet list for what i have due. Its also friday, so the weekend i looked forward for is fuckn ruined.
