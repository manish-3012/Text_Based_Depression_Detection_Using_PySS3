Why is my sister saying â€œmidsâ€ all the time? Is this a thing? (24f) My sister (19) is in college and saying everything â€œis midsâ€ and I just donâ€™t understand why. I didnâ€™t think I was that old, I was in college just a few years ago, no way this is a thing right?

Her reaction to everything is saying that itâ€™s mids. Not good, not bad, just in the middle. Mids. Drop her keys? Thatâ€™s so mids. Line is long? This is mids. She uses it as an insult as well. Youâ€™re so mids. Donâ€™t be mids.
