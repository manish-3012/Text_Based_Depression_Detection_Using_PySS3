Health Insurance Resources for an 18 year old My nephew is still in high school and just turned 18 in the United States (Kansas). Neither of his parents have health insurance, so neither does he. What resources are there for him to get health insurance or health care? Thought I would check here to see if there are any 18 or 19 year olds that have had to get their own health insurance. Thank you!
