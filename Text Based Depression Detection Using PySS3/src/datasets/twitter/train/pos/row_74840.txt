So me and my gf are in long distance Me and my gf are in long distance, about 10000 miles. Today she messaged me saying that something had come up and she couldn't text me for a whole week, and not to text her. To me this feels a bit unfair, I don't like how she just disappears for a whole week without giving me the slightest clue on what is going on. Not one detail she just says that and that's it. Im feeling a bit annoyed by this, is that reasonable? I feel like it's justified but I'm not really sure. Whenever she gets back I'm gonna talk to her about it but until then is gonna suck.
