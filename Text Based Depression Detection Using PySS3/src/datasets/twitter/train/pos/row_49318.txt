Forcing people to click on your links Listen, I donâ€™t care if you post ur link 5 time, I donâ€™t care if youâ€™re trying to force me to click on your link, idc if upmost ur links a thousand times, I still wonâ€™t click. 
Sure, post your links, but donâ€™t try and force me to click on them, itâ€™s my choice and youâ€™re not gonna do anything about it, and if you feel targeted at this, then itâ€™s your own fault for trying to force people to click on your links and you know you do that if you feel targeted.

Hereâ€™s a little context on the reason for this rant, every time one of my friends posts a link to their YouTube video, they post it like 5-7 times, and midway between their status post theyâ€™ll say â€œoh you thought you were gonna escape? Go and click itâ€ and itâ€™s so annoying, I hate it when people do that, trying to force u to click.
