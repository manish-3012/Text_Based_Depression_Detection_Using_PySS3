Guys, with the Greek-Turkish conflict going on I am scared for my family's safety and mine I am Greek and Turkey challenging our forces by trespassing our sea borders had upsetted us. Turkey is making some really aggressive moves and our government is trying its elbest not to provoke serious conflict which could lead to war. And because everything is being done for oil and sea power, and because Greece's geographic location is wanted by countries with great power, I am afraid that other countries will jump in the war.I hope people from Europe and other places of the world will be willing to help eliminate any chances of a war happening by siding with us and protest or make public statements about the subject to raise awareness
