I really donâ€™t think most people know what itâ€™s like to hate yourself this much. I feel so lost. Empty. I cry for help, but nobodyâ€™s here. Maybe this looks like a cry for attention. Truth is, it is. I need help. Someone. But in reality thereâ€™s nothing you can do. Thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do. I canâ€™t be fixed. Itâ€™s not a mood. Thereâ€™s literally something wrong with my brain. Iâ€™ll never be okay. Iâ€™ll never feel okay. Iâ€™m fucked. Drugs make me feel nice. Too bad Iâ€™m broke. Iâ€™m so lost in life. Lost within myself. I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. I donâ€™t see value in continuing on with this crushing existence. Truth is Iâ€™m afraid. I donâ€™t like pain. Mental or physical. Iâ€™ve never been one to cut. I hate blood. And it hurts. Suicide hurts too. It will hurt the people around me the most. They care but they donâ€™t really care. I donâ€™t want to live but I also donâ€™t really want to die. I just want to feel alright. I know Iâ€™m doomed for something terrible. A horrible life. Addiction. I just. Iâ€™m just tired. Emotionally. Mentally. Drained. Of everything that was there. And itâ€™s not coming back. Iâ€™m so broken and cold. I just way to lie down and drift away. Never to awake again. God. Why? Please. Just. Please. I. I donâ€™t want to be like this anymore. Please. Please help. Fuck
