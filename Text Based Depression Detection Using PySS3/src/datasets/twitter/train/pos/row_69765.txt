My whole foot hurts because of my toenail can someone help? So I accidentally hit my toe into my door and my nail jabbed itself into the left side of my big toe. Now it hurts and its numb. The numbness is slowly moving to my whole foot and it's hard to walk right now on my left foot. The hurting started around an hour ago, any help?
