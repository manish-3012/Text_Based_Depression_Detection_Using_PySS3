[M15] i need friends to talk to!!! reposting because im lazy lmao

i dont wanna write a low effort "need dms pls" post so imma say some stuff about myself so that this filler isn't the only thing here.

my name's Tommie (yes with an IE at the end, yes that's my actual name and not a nickname for Thomas or whatever), i live in California (Santa Clara County, anyone?). I love to play games and watch anime, and some of my other interests include cooking, voice acting, and crying in bed rethinking my life so that i can sleep better. i kid you not, it makes me feel good and it is an actual thing that i do. my favorite music artist is Joji. if you have anything in common with me at all (or not, i don't discriminate), hit me up!
