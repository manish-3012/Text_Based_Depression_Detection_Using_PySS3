Kinda embarrassing. This one popular kid asked me out, I sit next to him in science and wr never talk, he said he's into blondes. I kinda just laughed because I thought he was joking. I mean, we never socialized before and were in very different friend groups. I'm an Extroverted introvert, which means I'm an introvert unless I'm with certain people who are my friends. Well, he was NOT joking and asked why I was laughing. I told him I knew it was a prank and how I would never say yes to someone like him. ( he always joked around and he had a reputation of beating his girlfriends up.) Btw: he looks like white elmo and smells like fish. Ya so turns out he was not joking and actually wanted to date. He had to go out of the room cause he was crying so hard and it was so awkward cause I couldn't move seats.
