How should I tell my parents I am interested in starting a small business? How can I convince them to let me start it? I am genuinely asking for advice here. I feel like my parents might just brush it off or joke about it. Maybe if they saw how serious I was, they wouldnâ€™t make fun of it. But I donâ€™t know how to explain that I AM genuinely interested, that I have a plan, that I could potentially fund most of it with my own money, and that I can be committed. I feel like telling them will just make me feel stupid. Help!
