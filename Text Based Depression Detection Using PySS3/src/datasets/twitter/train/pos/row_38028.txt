I got groomed Hi all

I'm here to tell you all a cautionary story, this is the first time ill be fully talking about what went down but everything is altered, let's call me Lucy, and the perpetrator Amber.

2 years ago I just figured out I was trans and so as I do with most new revelations in my life I joined communities and talked to other trans people, this lead me to a group chat with 2 people of note, Amber and her friend Adam, now at the time I was 13-14 and was naively trusting them with all my life, not telling them where I lived at first but talking to them about the intimate areas of my life including times when I self harmed, but I felt as if I was safe. Amber was supposedly 15 at the time and wasn't trans but was just depressed and neglected she claims, I started talking with her, trying to help her, eventually it came to a point where she asked me to be her girlfriend. I said yes as I trusted her immensely at this point and we talked almost every night. Alot goes on but then we come to the day she starts giving me the idea that we should meet, she would fly out to meet me and we would meet up. Just a note, I had only seen two photos of her, and have voice called her a dozen times. Me being naive loved the thought and we started making plans quickly. Note that she claims to have had an abusive ex. Fast forward and she's in a hotel close to me, when I get a call from Adam, in a slightly frantic voice he says that I need to do something and that ambers ex had a knife to her throat, that's when I decided to call 999, they asked the routine questions, I was freaking out, but after I called the police I thought, what if she's not who she says she is, and I started questioning, fast forward 20 mind where there are 2 police cars at my house and Amber wouldn't do any video calls. Still to this day I feel like it was partly my fault.


Guys please
No matter how vigiallant you are you can't catch everything
Just stay safe
And don't meet anyone that you met online
