I've been having a really bad day. I dont want none of the "oh im so sorry" bullshit. Say some stuff that will feel like i got slapped in the face by life. Just full on navy seal type reality motivational shit I really need it because I lost a good friend over a wrong message. It wasn't suppose to go to her. If you are wondering what the message was, it was a dirty text for another friend and its a running joke between us. So yeah. Bad day
