i might be able to get a car and some freedom to escape my abusive family situation my moms boyfriend got in a minor accident in his honda civic and hes gonna buy a new car with the insurance money he gets from it since the accident wasn't his fault and im gonna see if i can buy the honda civic off of him and make it into my project car and work on fixing it with my grandpa he should be able to help guide me on how to fix it. in terms of damage the whole front bumper is fucked and the oil is leaking out of it but im gonna see if i cant fix it and make it my first car. realistically i should be able to fix the damage to the car for about 700 dollars worth of parts so ill see about using the money i have saved for that. it all depends on how much it costs me to buy it in the first place. this could either go very well for me or it doesn't and i have to pay a bunch for the car lmfao but we'll see about it im excited. i just might be able to get out of this situation and get a job and get my freedom from the house and my parents. i really hope i have enough money saved i have around 900/1000 dollars but i really dont know if that will be enough
