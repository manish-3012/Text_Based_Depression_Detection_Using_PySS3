Tip for not being awkward infront of your crush. I honestly donâ€™t have any experience with relationships and Iâ€™ve never actually had a crush on somebody BUT my friends have said I give out good relationship advice so

Donâ€™t try to think about them too much while youâ€™re in public, I know its hard but try your best to think about something else. I know a dude who had a crush on this girl and whenever he went up to here he was always calm and relaxed and he told me that he wasnt thinking about having a crush, rather just about him and her being friends.
