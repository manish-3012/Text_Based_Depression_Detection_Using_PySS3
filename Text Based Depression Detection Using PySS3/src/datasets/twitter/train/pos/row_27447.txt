Small time youtuber, lets help him out (not self plug, reposted because not a lot of people were awake) A while ago I came across a horror lets play channel with 140 subscribers, but he usually only gets around 11 views on each of his videos. I find him really funny and the fact that he makes unfiltered vids without ads makes me want to help him out a little. The kind of vids he makes seem like stuff reddit teenagers would like, so here you go-

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzhlKnIqm-ClmWs2X0WlMQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzhlKnIqm-ClmWs2X0WlMQ) this is his channel. He gets most of his content from [Itch.io](https://itch.io/) games, so you can play the same games for free.  

the first time I posted this he got 4 new subscribers,  and honestly I just wanna make this bubbly man happy :)
