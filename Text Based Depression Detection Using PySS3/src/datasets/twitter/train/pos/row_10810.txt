My dad just mocked me for not having a girlfriend Dad It's not 1960 anymore when kids got married at 16 17 .


Im Really deppresd I don't want nobody by my side because why would being deppresd in a relationship be so much better? If anything I would make the other person more deppresd and bring his mood down.

And plus it's mor common not to have a girlfriend because In my high school there are 600kids and only 40 of them said they're in a relationship (yes there was a test about this)

I want no one I just want to be dead
