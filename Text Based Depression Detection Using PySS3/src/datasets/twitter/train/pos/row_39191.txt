My dad is pressing contempt of court charges against my mom My mom and dad have been apart for like 4 or 5 years now and even before that my dad worked a lot so my mom has always been like the main parent. I like my dad he tries to me a good dad but he fails sometimes. In there divorce they had some debt that they thought would go away in the bankruptcy but it didn't and my mom is being held accountable for it but that company is trying to sue my mom AND dad (In the divorce agreement it says that my mom would be is responsible for them but that was because they weren't supposed to be there.) Anyways the debts went to pay for my dads schooling, car, and just living expenses. My dad is trying to press charges against my mom so I told him that until he drops those charges he will not be seeing me. He has yet to text me back 3 days later. Does he even care?
