my grandaunt just dies and i am really confused rn so this morning i received some really bad news, my grandaunt died. The problem was i never really had any relationship with her. I only ever talked to her once or twice i think so never really developed any sort of relationship with her. That being said her and my grandma had a very tight bond and i am incredibly close to my grandma. Today i could see that she was visibly upset and she was eating a bit less than usual. I asked her if everything was ok and she said yes but since i have had no relation with my grandaunt, i couldn't really do anything to make my grandma feel better other than asking if she was ok and telling her that it will be fine. a large amount of my family is also very sad and i have no idea how to talk to them, but keeping my mouth shit feels bad.

i just don't know what to do. The worst part about it is the fact that she dies of corona virus, something that is really bad in India atm. I just felt like i needed to talk about this because there is no one else to talk to this about. I beg everyone here to stay safe, wear a mask and follow all of the safety measures.
