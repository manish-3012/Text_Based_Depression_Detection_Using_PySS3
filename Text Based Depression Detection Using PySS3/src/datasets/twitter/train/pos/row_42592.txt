Whatâ€™s wrong with the world today I feel like people are going out of their way to make life miserable to others. People are actively more aggressive and rude. So many shitty things are happening in the world. Lots of negativity all around. Itâ€™s so draining. Why canâ€™t things be better? Does the world feel wrong to you guys too?
