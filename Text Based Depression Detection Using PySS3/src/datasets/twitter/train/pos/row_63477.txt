I had a dream In the dream I was watching a movie and then someone knocked on the door. I opened the door and this beautiful girl was there. We watched the movie together and hugged all the time. Then she said she needed to go and I woke up. Only to realize i needed to go out my bed in an hour. So there I was in my bed crying that i will never see her again and slowly forgetting what she looks like...

What a live do I have
