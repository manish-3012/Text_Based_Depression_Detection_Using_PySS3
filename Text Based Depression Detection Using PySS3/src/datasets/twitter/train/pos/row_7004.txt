My grandma is an utter b#tch Alright, little context before I start this rant
For Christmas I bought a VR headset and a few games the 2 focus games will be Superhot VR and Gorn, My grandma has a big enough room for VR so she lets me use it, she also likes Puzzles and had a big fishtank she had in the corner, then moved to tbe center of the room, Alright time for rant

G O R N rant: [This was a few weeks ago] I was playing gorn, beating someone to death, there was a guy with a bow around the middle, I physically walked over and threw a punch and BROKE 2 KNUCKLES AND A PINKEY AGAINST A FISH TANK, I then pause the game, look at my grandma, and she then shouts 'oh my god [real name here] You almost broke the fish tank! That would of cost me $400!' She cared more about a fish tank then her grandson lying on the floor bleeding, she moved the fish tank back

SuperHot VR rant: this one happened today, I was on the last level of Superhot VR cutting some bullets, I go for a swing right to not die and while I was cutting the bullets, she walked over to the middle of the room, hunching over to work on a puzzle, ignoring me swinging like a madman, I almost hit her in the back, my dad notices, tells me to pause the game, I pull up the toaster I was murdering red guys in and see that she was standing RIGHT NEXT TO ME!

It's like she's trying to make me feel bad for her, it's just

She's a b#tch
