Hello fellow teens It is I, totallyateenager and I want you to know that my mom didnâ€™t buy me AirPods so Iâ€™m depressed now. But good news, my crush said yes to me asking her out! So I thought I would bake some cookies as a little celebration! Please donâ€™t give me awards because theyâ€™re kinda stupid and pointless because basically this sub in a nutshell is all about trying to get awards for some reason so yeah.
