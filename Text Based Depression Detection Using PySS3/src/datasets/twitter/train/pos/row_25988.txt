One of my favorite guitarists released a single, and OH MY FAEKING GOASH Its [The Perfect World by Marty Friedman (ft Alfakyun)](https://youtu.be/pq3MqusXS-I) It's basically another version of the ending theme to the anime show "B: The Beginning" (which Marty also wrote, if im not mistaking)...sorry for interrupting, I just **CAN'T** stop listening to this song
