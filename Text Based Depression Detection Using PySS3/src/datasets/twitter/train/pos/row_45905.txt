Just something I feel like I need to say 1. If you only support the LGBT community

To only have a that one gay friend

Out of pity (what I mean by this this is that you think gay people are oppressed people that need their hands held all the time)

Or to see any drama/ get "intel" on men

YOU ARE A CUNT


2. If you call a black person a "coon" or any poc something unnecessary like coon, just because they don't say they're oppresses, or dont have the same political views, opinions, or anything in general that dosen't malign with yours because "it's suppose to" than not only are you A SHITTY CUNT, but you also dont want actual equality. 


Thanks for listeningðŸ¤—
