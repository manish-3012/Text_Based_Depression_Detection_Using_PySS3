Teens of reddit Y is it that girls always says that e nice and be yourself is all u need to do to get a gf when they always fall in love with the bad guys Like don't get me wrong all girls aren't like this and I don't really mind not having a gf but I have friends who are like the nicest ppl ever but they always end up getting rejected by the girls that say that being nice is everything that you have to do and one more thing is that they always end up being called simps like even me only because we are doing nice things to any girl but back on track why is it that all nice guys ends up rejected while the bad boys don't. When u say that it is the other way around
