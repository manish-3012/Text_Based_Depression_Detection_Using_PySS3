I really donâ€™t know anymore, just what the hell? I almost went through a plan to kill myself but backed out, I told someone, and got put in the hospital for a week.

I finally get out and they make me go to an anxiety program thatâ€™s three hours daily, I tell them I just need help with my depression, they say â€œmaybe your anxiety is causing your depressionâ€.

Now my family finds my cutting stuff and this freaking program finds out and says â€œI think you are really struggling with depression and need help with that before we can continue the anxiety programâ€ no shit.

They then tell me Iâ€™m now in a six hour daily program to help fight my depression.

Fucking kill me now.
