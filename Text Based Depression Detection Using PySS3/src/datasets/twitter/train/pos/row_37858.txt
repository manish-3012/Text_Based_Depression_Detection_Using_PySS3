If I ever become rich.. I am gonna make, realistic versions of the TF2 characters, the only two i'm worried about are spy and medic, all the other ones I have decent plans for, pyro's dragon fury and sticky bombs, are the 2nd, rocket jumping is gonna be a shit storm, the regenerating sanvich may be kinda easy, if you have any other helpful shit, it could be helpful
