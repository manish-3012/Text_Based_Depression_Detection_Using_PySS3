CODE RED I LIED ABOUT KNOWING HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR CURRENT CHAIN OF EVENTS:

 \&gt;picked up the guitar after 4 years

\&gt;learned to play like the first 10 seconds of let it be

\&gt;uploaded it on insta

\&gt;very pretty girl with angelic voice asked me to come over so we can sing and play guitar together :)))

\&gt;I SAY YEAH SURE WHEN ARE YOU FREE

\&gt;Wanna come today at 6? See ya then!

\&gt;I ONLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE FIRST 10 SECONDS OF LET IT BE WHAT DO I DO 

Genuinely though, any advice for strumming? Most songs of the genre she sings are just some basic coords so that's fine, but it sounds a bit scratchy when I strum and I think I have a problem with the timing. Any feedback appreciated lol
