I just realized that i can probably get killed or hurt in most of the world without consequences I just learned about the gay panic defense and im honestly just shocked how much lgbt phobia there still is. Dont even get me started on western countries.

Also, im sick of all the biphobia, especially from the lgbt community. 
Im not out yet, but im already sick of it
