Fighting with my best friend All of March has been a fight with my best friend. Weâ€™ve been friends for three years and, like itâ€™s the most connected Iâ€™ve ever felt to anyone, but oh my god. This last month has been so hard. Weâ€™re constantly arguing or mad at each other, I feel like I cry every time I talk to them. Itâ€™s been awful... my other friends donâ€™t seem to get it because we always seem to click when weâ€™re with our friend group. I just felt like I needed someone to talk to, even if itâ€™s a Reddit post. Iâ€™ve been miserable, and Iâ€™m just hoping this will pass.
