how do i tell my (sort of christian) parents i donâ€™t believe in god? i had a revelation recently and realized i was atheist. now, iâ€™ve entertained the idea of being atheist, i just never fully thought of myself as atheist until now. with everything thatâ€™s been happening, iâ€™m fairly certain there is no god. 

iâ€™ve hinted it towards my parents saying something along the lines of â€œwould you be disappointed if i didnâ€™t go to church when i grow older?â€ their response: â€œyes.â€ 

however, my mom showed a bit more mercy. she told me that at the end of the day, it was totally my decision. iâ€™m a little reluctant to tell her still because her immediate response was yes. she had said this after she thought about it.

my parents are really loving so obviously no hate towards them, but my mom came from a very religious family and so did my dad. so how do i tell them i donâ€™t *actually* believe there is a god?
