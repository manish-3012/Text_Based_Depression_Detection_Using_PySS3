Canâ€™t feel anything positive anymore. TL;DR: this is just another depressive rant.

I donâ€™t know what to say other than i can barely feel anything anymore except for anxiety and stress. My insomnia can keep me up for days but iâ€™ll still feel just as tired as if i had a 9 hour sleep. I canâ€™t grow to like anyone, iâ€™m just so lonely because i canâ€™t catch feelings at all.


Iâ€™m at the constant verge of tears but i can never actually cry, all i can do is let it pile up. I never get any help IRL and the only help i can get online is basically just â€œitâ€™ll get better with timeâ€. 

I never have fun, all i do is sit down in front of my fucking computer to make time pass. I canâ€™t achieve shit in school, my parents donâ€™t give a fuck. I just spend every night outside walking for hours music blasting in my ears, crying on the inside and just wishing i could cry on the outside. Itâ€™ll be pitch black, ice cold and iâ€™ll still just walk untill i collapse.

I feel so alone all the time, whether itâ€™s in my bed all day or around people. 


I can barely sleep at all, i feel like constant shit. The only time i slept this weekend was 4 hours on my floor with my window open whilst it was snowing. I canâ€™t eat anymore iâ€™m so underweight for my length, barely one meal a day. 


I donâ€™t know what to do, all i want is for someone to appreciate me and talk to me. All i want is someone that cares for me, someone that loves me. But i canâ€™t even get that if i tried because i just canâ€™t care or love anyone else.

I see no light in this sea of darkness, i just sit here, rotting away for someone to one day show me the light...
