Things my dream house (decrepit looking wizard shack) would have â€¢stairs that when you pull a lever turn into a slide 
â€¢very out of place chandelier that falls nearly missing you whenever you step on a specific tile on the floor 
â€¢mr Rodgers style trolley system that runs along every wall of the house in a big loop 
â€¢poltergeist 
â€¢false doormat that is actually a trap door that lets out into a dungeon whenever you ring the doorbell 
â€¢chair that ejects you like a cartoon if it decides it doesnâ€™t like you
