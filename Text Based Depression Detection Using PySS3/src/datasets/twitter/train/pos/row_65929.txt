The Queen is a vampire Think about it! She is really old, according to this article (https://www.delish.com/uk/food-news/g32141355/foods-the-royal-family-dont-eat/) she hates garlic, the weakness to vampires, also the first fictional book about vampires was published in Britain! And she also wears a hat to keep her out of the sun, why would she do that in a colder country like Britain, oh I know! Because she is a vampire.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk!
