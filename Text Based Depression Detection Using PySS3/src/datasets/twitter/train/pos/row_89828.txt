How to hang out with a friend (one that i like more than a friendðŸ˜³) if my mother wont let me Hey guys, so im a 17 y/o male and my mother is really overprotective.  Last time i asked her to hang out with this girl, she made up every excuse for me to not be able to hang with her, from coronavirus to saying that i could be accused of sexual harrassment or something and i just need to stay way from people who we dont know their family, etc. And that infuriated me because she let me hang out with another girl just fine only bc we knrw her family.  Anyways, i really like this girl who asked me to hang out and i dont wanna reject her offer to hang out. Ive explained it to her, but its been like 3 months and ik shes tired of waiting on me.  Any advice? Ive tried talking to my mom about it and she just doesnt listen to anything i have to say.  Should i sneaknout? If so, how?
