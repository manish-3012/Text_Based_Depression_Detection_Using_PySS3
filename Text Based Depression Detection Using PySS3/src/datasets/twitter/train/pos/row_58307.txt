I think my crush stalks me on Instagram There is a fanpage from a singer who likes my post and watches my stories on every instagram page I use. Without following them.

That fanpage has a video of that singer during a performance of hers. And my crush has EXACTLY the same video on her instagram. And both posts were posted on the same day.

So I watched the instagram from the singer and my crush has liked (almost) every single post of her. 

So I sent the fanpage an DM, just a simple 'Hi' to start a conversation and the page blocked me immediately and the page deleted that video now.

Do you think it's my crush?

I am sorry for any grammatical mistakes lol
