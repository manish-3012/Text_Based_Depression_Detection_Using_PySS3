I got scared by the wind blowing from my fan So basically my mom told me to get water for the soup sheâ€™s making. I was browsing reddit, so I decided to bring my iPad with me. So I got her the water, but since I was so focused on reddit I got scared when my fanâ€™s air just blew at my leg. I feel like an idiot now.
