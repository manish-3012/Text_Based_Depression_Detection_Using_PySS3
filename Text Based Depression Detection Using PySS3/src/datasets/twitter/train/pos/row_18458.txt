I need a new life I'm feeling kinda depressed cause if i make a little mistake, such as forget to use my phone without asking, I get like a 30 minute lecture and banned from using it. Now my mum thinks that she should take all my technology cause I'm feeling depressed, even her college says so. I don't know if I can come back to see these comments but its just depressing to be banned cause I'm depressed so now I'm more depressed. Even though I'm going through this, I hope none of you go through similar thing. Love all of you for being a great community, no homo obviously (Now you know my gender :)  so none of you guys need to try and simp help).
