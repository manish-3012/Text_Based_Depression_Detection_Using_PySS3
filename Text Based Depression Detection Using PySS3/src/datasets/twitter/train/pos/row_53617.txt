Can you guys help me? Bruh so okay Iâ€™m 15 and my dad put like age restrictions on the WiFi so now I canâ€™t look at the *hub* and all other websites with similar *themes* and itâ€™s very annoying. Now I m is reddit and redditors so I think you guys will realise how annoying this is and how hard it would be to just live without this stuff. And yes Iâ€™ve tried turning on mobile data on my phone and turning off WiFi it still doesnâ€™t work. What I guess Iâ€™m asking is if you guys know a way I could cheat the system? Find a way to get onto the *hub*?
