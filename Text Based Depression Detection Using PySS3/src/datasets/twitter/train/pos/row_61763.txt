People really complain too much about getting hit in the balls I'm a guy and I got hit in the balls so many times and it hurts, but still it's not that bad, I see guys on the ground for like 3 minutes saying that it hurts really bad, it really isn't that bad.


Btw I got hit in the balls by a professional kravmaga trainer it was like 30 second of pain and then it was gone.
