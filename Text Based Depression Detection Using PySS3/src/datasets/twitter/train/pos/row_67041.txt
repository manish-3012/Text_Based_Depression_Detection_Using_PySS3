Wanna here something freaky? Iâ€™ve been working on becoming a more appealing person over the past year, and itâ€™s been working for the most part. Iâ€™ve lost a good bit of weight, gained some muscle, and have become more fashionable as well as a more agreeable person overall. As a result, Iâ€™ve become more confident getting more of a definitive friend group. But the absolute weirdest part is that I donâ€™t know what to do next. Iâ€™m at a point where I could talk to anyone, maybe ask a girl out and have the chance of actually succeeding, but I donâ€™t actually know what I want to do. Iâ€™m in a place Iâ€™ve never been before, and itâ€™s so weird.
