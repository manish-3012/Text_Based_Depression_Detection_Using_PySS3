Bruh my dad thinks there will be a civil war over trump He says he doesn't want one but he also says the American people won't stand for their election being stolen. He thinks that even if just 1% of trump voters rise up and march on the capital it would be over. Like bruh even if that did happen you really think ~1 million rednecks with semi autos are even capable of facing the might of a couple of U.S. divisions, last time I checked the NRA doesn't have many anti tank weapons and don't even get me started on air superiority. Even if they they somehow got coordinated across all the states, formed a mass of 1 million and bum rushed the capita; the government would relocate and await more support. I swear my parents are good people but their politics are so wack they think Fox News is too liberal.
