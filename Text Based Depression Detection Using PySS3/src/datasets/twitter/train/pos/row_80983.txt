Come join our Minecraft Cross-Play Server! BasicallyMC is a newly revitalised server, with a safe discord environment, and cross platform play between Java and Bedrock.   
We are currently looking for new, active members, as well as staff to help moderate, to play on the server and be apart of the community. We really don't care who you are as long as you are, we don't discriminate.

Our Discord has its own custom bot,  and we plan to add in game &gt; &gt; Discord chat, as well as other functionality. 

We are launching the server in the coming days, and will either restart at 1.17 or reload chunks.

Any questions please ask in the comments or DM me, if you would like to join please DM me for discord link. :)
