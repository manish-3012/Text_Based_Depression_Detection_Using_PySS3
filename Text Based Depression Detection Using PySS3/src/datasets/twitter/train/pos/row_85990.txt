Promoting a community for LGBTQ teens to chat and find friends!!! r/LGBTeenChat is a new community that I'm building to be a recourse for LGBTQ teens to find friends and people to talk to as well as ask questions and be a little more lax than some of the other communities. It's supposed to be a comfortable space, but right now it's an empty space. If you are a part of the LGBTQ+ community and a teenager, then your support to help grow the community would be greatly appreciated!!!!
