I masturbated for the first time ever. It was weird. I've seen a couple things from porn but the semen was really weird. It got everywhere and it made a huge mess on my hand. I don't know whether I'm gonna do it again or not.
Here's some things I learned

1. No longer horny

2. Felt good as hell

3. Be sure to have something to clean it in hand quickly

4. Do it at a time no one can see you.
