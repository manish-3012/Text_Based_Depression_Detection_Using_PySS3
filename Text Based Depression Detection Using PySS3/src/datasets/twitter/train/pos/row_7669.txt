THIS IS A MESSAGE TO ALL HIGH-SCHOOL-ERS OF REDDIT I am 15 year old. I am not bragging, but I'm the popular kid at school. Dont ask me what they see in me. 

Anyway, I've seen a lot of people giving girl advice or guy advice, blah blah blah. But no one was talking about this. I thought that I would. 

I am a 15 yr male. I have never been in a relationship. 

That was a sad start. Lemme start again.

Ok, seriously. 

\- Don't worship the popular guys. 

You don't want to be the popular guy. You dont want to impress girls. You don't want to be the 'bad boy'

"oH bUt u/I_flew_the_Kamikaze, tHeY bUlLy Me. I wAnT To bE cOoL tOo"

No.

Just no.

Being popular sucks. I wish i wasnt popular. Honest.

\- One more thing I wanted to say. Take your exams seriously. Dont slack off saying "Im A 12 Yr OlD MiNeCrFt YoUtUbEr"

No one likes those. Have a plan B. You want to sdo anything, fine. But have a plan B. Something solid, something like a safety cushion to fall upon if your passion can't feed ya.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Love is shit. All of you with girlfriends or boyfriends, good. You've found your true love. Yay.

But others, lonely people, don't be so stuck up on love. Stop complaining you're lonely. Find a hobby, be yourself. I used to be lonely too. I get it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- If you're depressed like I am, vent it out. If you can,t, DM me. I can't vent it because Im too embarassed. Now its like poison for me, its too late for me to do anything. I am beyond repair. But you're not. So TALK.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Girls, this one is for you. Please don't make fun of us if we aren't "manly". Fuck you if you say that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats it, ig.
