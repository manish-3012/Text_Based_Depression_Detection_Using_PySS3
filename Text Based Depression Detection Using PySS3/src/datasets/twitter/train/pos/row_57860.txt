I like her but don't know how/when/if I should tell her. Sorry for the huge wall of text and typos (I'm on mobile).

I'm in 9th grade and she's in 11th (Ik big age gap at least imo). We both go to the same church and private/christian school. I really like her and she sometimes flirts with me (idk if it's just to get a reaction out of me or not). 

Go back about 6 months and I added her on snap. Then one day she started flirting with me (once again I don't know if it was just to get a reaction out of me). Then I told her that she's 2 years older than me and we probably can't be together because of the age gap. She then proceeded to say "age is just a number" and stuff like that. Even before I added her on snap I was really into her. Then I told her I felt uncomfortable and kinda creeped out (I wasn't creeped out and just didn't know what to say. Looking back on this I realize I really screwed up).  She then said "sorry" and "sometimes I just get ahead of myself". What do I do? I really like her and want to tell her but I'm afraid of rejection and what people will think around me (once again, a christian school and church). 

Thanks for any help in advance!
