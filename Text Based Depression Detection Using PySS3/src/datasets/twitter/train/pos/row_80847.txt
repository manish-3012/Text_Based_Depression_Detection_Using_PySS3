Iâ€™m not sure if my best friend is as interested in me as I in him. (19m) 
Here goes nothing:
So, Iâ€™ve had a best friend throughout the last 10 years. In all the years weâ€™ve been friends, it has always been me reaching out to him. We meet up and then a couple of weeks go by without me hearing anything from him, then I decide to text him, heâ€™s up for it and we meet up. Repeat. Heâ€™s a busy guy and forgets small stuff easily, so itâ€™s not unlike him to just not reach out.

I havenâ€™t really thought about it much up until now, but itâ€™s beginning to bother me a little. When we meet, heâ€™s interested in how Iâ€™m doing and everything is great, but itâ€™s just nice to feel wanted and it being a little more neutral if he reached out to me a little. Is that crazy of me?

Should I talk to him about it, or just let it slide?
I usually wait s couple of weeks before reaching out to him again just so it doesnâ€™t seem too pushy, but ideally it would be nice to write after a couple of days. I donâ€™t see many other friends than him, so my social life kinda lives and dies with him. 
Does you guys have similar friendships? Any advice maybe;)
Take what you can use from my unimportant first world problem, and have an amazing day out there!
