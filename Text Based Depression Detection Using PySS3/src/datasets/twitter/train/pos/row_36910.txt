Well I just turned in a lot of assignments... Iâ€™m failing every class right now, I get good grades on tests i just donâ€™t do homework. My mom basically did a crackdown on me today and I started working on every assignment. In the event that I fail, I plan on dropping out and working for my dad. But Iâ€™m so lost right now to be honest. I didnâ€™t plan on surviving this long, Iâ€™ve wanted to kms for so long but I just canâ€™t because I feel bad for my family. But I canâ€™t tell my mom how I feel because I feel like she might think Iâ€™m just using it as an excuse.
