AP HW Stress Hey guys,

Rn Iâ€™m in four AP classes and Iâ€™m super behind. My mother is doing my AP Psychology hw quizzes/tests while I do all my other classes including Math. Is this right? Should I allow her to do that? Has anyone else had this problem where their parents had to help them do AP HW?
