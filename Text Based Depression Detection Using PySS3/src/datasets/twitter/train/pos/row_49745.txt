My first ever design TikTok I make album covers as a hobby. Iâ€™m looking to get into it full-time as I know my talents will be wasted in a normal 9-5 job. 

Iâ€™m looking for recommendations for album covers I can redesign and as this is possibly the MOST active subreddit, I figured Iâ€™d ask here first. 

[Hereâ€™s my first upload](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeFR39gU/). I look forward to seeing your recommendations and hopefully turning them into something funky and cool ðŸ˜Ž
