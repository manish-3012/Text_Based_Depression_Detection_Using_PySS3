Looking for new friendly faces! 
Hey! I'm Henry and I'm looking for some folk who would be willing to try their hand at our relatively small server.
Our mod team does its best to keep everyone happy, and we have plenty of kind and caring residents that would gladly welcome you.
While it may be true that the server may not be the most active at the moment, we'd love for good folks like you to liven up our soft and cozy atmosphere.

Dm for details and invitations.
