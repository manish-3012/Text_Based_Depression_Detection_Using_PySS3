Gender reveal parties are B.S. Gender reveals parties are just dumb excuses to have parties and stuff. Then you say things like â€œmy baby may have a vagina but heâ€™s a boy!â€ And shit like that. You canâ€™t decide a babyâ€™s sexuality when it canâ€™t do anything other than cry, sleep, and shit itself. Plus, letâ€™s be honest, itâ€™s just some fancy things modern parents do to â€œfollow social standardsâ€.
