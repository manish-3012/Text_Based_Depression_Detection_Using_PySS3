Flashback to the time I had to get an MRI So I ended up in a children's hospital a while ago because of a concussion, there was more to it but I'll spare the details, and the doctor wanted to take an MRI. They hand me this thing of CDs and say "okay, since this can take a while, we're gonna put you under, but also heres some music to help ease the process."




So in this *children's* hospital, I find a 2pac CD in the CD case, and you bet I was like "fuck it, I pick 2pac. I wanna see how many times he says the n-word before I stop remembering things." Of course I didn't say that out loud, but that was my thought process.




3 times. He said the n-word 3 times before I was out.
