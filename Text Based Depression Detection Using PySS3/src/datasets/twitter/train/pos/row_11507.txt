If parents set a rule they should follow it too Examples:

â€œNo video games during the weekâ€ - My dad plays video games all week while Iâ€™m not allowed to

â€œNo non-school related activities during the weekâ€ - Ok then no non work related topics during the week

â€œHelp out around the houseâ€ - Ok I would if I could but you definitely can just get off your drunken ass and do something

Thereâ€™s a shit ton more and all the ones that make no sense ore are disobeyed by my Dad.
