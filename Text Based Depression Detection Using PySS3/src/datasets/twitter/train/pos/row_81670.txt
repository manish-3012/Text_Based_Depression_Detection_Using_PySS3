Happy thanksgiving yâ€™all!! To be frank, thanksgiving fucking sucks, I mean it *blows*. 

You get all these people from weird corners of your family coming into your house so they can snoop around and shit, then you gotta eat grandmaâ€™s dry ass turkey but you still gotta say itâ€™s good because sheâ€™s the one with the iron fucking fist and you canâ€™t tell if everyone else secretly agrees or has a shit taste. After this election, thanksgiving is gonna be *heated*

TL;DR: thanksgiving is ass, and I envy those who donâ€™t celebrate it
