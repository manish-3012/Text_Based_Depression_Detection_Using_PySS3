I applied to six jobs today. So I (16M) have wanted to get the fuck out of my house for a *long* time now. My mum's an alcoholic who takes her shit out on me and my Dad's an asshole.

I've now applied to six jobs (yes, all in one day lol) and hopefully I get hired for at least one of them. The money will go a long way - they're all minimum wage so maybe not towards me moving out just yet but perhaps towards making my home life better.

Treating myself, you know?

Since I'm a student and UK laws are weird I can only work one job so if I get hired at more than one I have to turn all but one down, but I'm really hoping I'll get hired.

I did apply for a part time vacancy at GAME which I'm reallllly hoping I get hired for. It's the best shop on the planet.
