My grandfather compared a woman to a monkey So the title really isnâ€™t a joke. i donâ€™t know if anyone has seen, but collage football in the US just had a woman join a team and i think thatâ€™s pretty cool. but my grandfather was talking about it and said â€œwho cares if she scored a goal? you could teach a monkey to score a goal.â€ which is the biggest bullshit statement. Like what? Why the fuck would you say that? thereâ€™s just no reason. 

sorry for the rant, but i donâ€™t have anyone to talk to this about.
