My mother gave away one of our puppies without telling us so now my sister is crying. We were having a really good time playing with all four of them then suddenly my dad comes with this guy and he takes a puppy away. It was just so out of the blue and honestly I was so heartbroken. My sister is only 7 so obviously she took it really hard and started sobbing. I had to be the strong older sister and stay composed even though this made my already bad day worse. My dad also told me that we can only keep one so I have to give away my favourite one so my sister doesnâ€™t lose her favourite one. It makes sense tho since Iâ€™m leaving next year but Iâ€™m hoping to give the other two to my close friends so I can see them anytime. Did I cry a bit at the thought of that? Maybe. Now I had to buy my sister a bunch of stuff to make her happy. Obviously bribery will work well on her but I think it might take me a bit more time. I thought I could part from them in my own time but I guess not. I had to be the one to pick which one he could take so now I feel like the devil. 

I hope youâ€™re all doing phenomenally well and that youâ€™re a very amazing day because you deserve it. Bye
