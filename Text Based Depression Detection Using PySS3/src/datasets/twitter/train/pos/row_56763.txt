I used to help people on r/depression and r/suicidewatch cause so many people make posts and need help but most of the time no one comments on them Now i donâ€™t anymore since i agree with them life is pointless and if youâ€™re suffering why not end it i mean if you arent happy and there isnâ€™t a meaning of anything why bother
