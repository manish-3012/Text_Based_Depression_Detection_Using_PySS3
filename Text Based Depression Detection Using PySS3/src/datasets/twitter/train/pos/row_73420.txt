I really need help So when my uncle I was really close to died I got some of his stuff, including his favorite sweatshirt. I love this sweatshirt and I wear it a lot but the zipper won't zip anymore. I'll get it zipped up then they'll all split again and I have no clue why 

If someone knows how to fix this then please tell me
