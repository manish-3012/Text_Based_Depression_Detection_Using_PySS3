I feel like something is wrong with me There is this girl at my school, we very much dislike each other, and we only ever interact when we have to, shes friends with people in my friend group so relatively often we do have to interact. It's usually sarcastic comments and back handed compliments to each other, but the other day when me an a few friends were hanging out, we went by our school, and for whatever reason when we walked by places it made me think of her, not in like a, ohhh I like You kind of way, but not in bad way either, I almost miss the bickering, and I feel like thats messed up, maybe I just miss social interaction but idk I feel like my brain is  broken
