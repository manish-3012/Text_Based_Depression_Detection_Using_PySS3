Just want to shed some light on the people who got affected by 9/11 Today is the day of one of the most horrific things to happen to mankind - 9/11. I am one of the few lucky ones who didnâ€™t get effected by 9/11, but I know many people did, and I just want to say that be strong, and always remember that someone will be there for you when you are going through a hard time in your life, whether itâ€™s some internet stranger or someone you know personally. RIP to all of the people who have died on that day.
