I have a problem.  Alright, so last year before everything went to hell I told a girl I liked her. This wasn't just some random girl tho. This was actually one of my few friends. She said she liked me back. Afterwards we went on with our lives as normal. It was never mentioned again. We haven't seen each other in about 8ish months. But I've started to redevelop a crush on her. Has anyone else had a situation like this? Any ideas on what to do?
