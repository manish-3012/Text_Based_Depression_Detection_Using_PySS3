I donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life 

Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself or anything but Iâ€™ve considered it before I cry when I wake up because I donâ€™t know how to deal with how I feel 

My dad tried to act like he cares but then he started yelling 

My parents think itâ€™s just a hormone thing but Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life I just feel like everything means nothing because Iâ€™m gonna die anyways I want to enjoy life but I canâ€™t 

I just donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™ve tried doing hobbies and stuff that makes me happy but they donâ€™t I feel like my parents are embarrassed by me which I donâ€™t really care about 

I just needed to vent thanks
