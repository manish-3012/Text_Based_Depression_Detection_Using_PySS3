any other poc teens who once made their identity their entire personality? similarly, have you ever like just forsaken your identity completely? 

because whenever i lie awake in bed and those stupid embarrassing memories come back i wonder if anybody else goes through the same things. i used to wish i were white and didn't go out in the sun because i was afraid of getting a tan and used bleaching products. then when i found out about internalized racism, i tried to appreciate my identity more. but i think i did it wrong. people used to complain about how lele pons had to always let everyone know she's latina and lilly singh always talks about how she's a bisexual woman of color and i wonder if i came off to my white peers as one of those people. the way i used to do it is that i'd speak in urdu and wear my hijab and pray in public (rather than hiding in some private room like i used to do) and talk about my culture a lot (like i'd interject it in every other conversation). 

anyone else been through something like this?
