My rabbit committed suicide... A few years back i had a rabbit. She was the cutest thing ever. I loved her a lot. 

let's get to the my short story. It was a normal summer day and i was chilling upstairs playing some videogames. I got bored and went down stairs to play with my cute little rabbit. I go in my backyard to search for her. After a good 10 minutes of not being able to find her i asked my dad where she was. My dad said with a really sad voice that she committed suicide. I was shocked and asked him how did she manage to do it. She somehow went under  some pipes and hit a pipe and the pipe fell down on her. 

Rip. I loved you !
