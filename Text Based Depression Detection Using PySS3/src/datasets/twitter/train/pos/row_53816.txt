Does anyone wanna chat? DM me :)))))) Along with certain other squashes and pumpkins, the zucchini belongs to the species Cucurbita pepo.[4] It can be dark or light green. A related hybrid, the golden zucchini, is a deep yellow or orange color.[5]

In a culinary context, the zucchini is treated as a vegetable; it is usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment. Botanically, zucchinis are fruits, a type of botanical berry called a "pepo", being the swollen ovary of the zucchini flower.

The zucchini, like all squash, originates in the Americas, specifically Mesoamerica. Its original name in Nahuatl is ayo(h)conetl, also with the variants ayo or ayocotzin (plural ayococone). After this, the concept and use of zucchini was developed in northern Italy in the second half of the 19th century, long after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas in the early 16th century.
