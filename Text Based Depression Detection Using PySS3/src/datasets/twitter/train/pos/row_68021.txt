Aight this is not supposed to be serious but this is my first time I saw a black person. I just got this funny memory of the first time I saw a POC that wasnâ€™t like just dark brown skin  and for context Iâ€™m Mexican and as a kid I would regularly go to like play at a soccer field. I remember this one time i saw a black person for the first time and I just told my mom in Spanish â€œWhy is he B L A C Kâ€. Funny memory but yeah thatâ€™s it.
