I am so tired I am in a really bad situation right now and needed to talk about it. I went to the website "Kids Help Phone" which is a helpline for kids and teenagers in Canada. I tried everything, I texted them without answer, I called and they got me waiting for over an hour without ever responding. I am just lost on what to do anymore, even specialized ressources don't answer me.
