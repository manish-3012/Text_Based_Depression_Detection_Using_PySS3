I can't think of a username I'm thinking of deleting this account and I can't think of a new username. I really struggle to think of usernames when I sign up for something; my username on Spotify is 'Sweatypalms'. I dunno if anyone can help because y'all haven't a clue who I am or what I like. It'd have to be something I feel fits me specifically. If there is a case anyone can help, then here is a list of things I like: movies (*Alien*, *Star Wars*, *A Clockwork Orange*, *The Terminator*, *John Wick*, *The Thing*, David Lynch's works), music like David Bowie, Pet Shop Boys, *Doctor Who*, *Discworld*, Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro, stuff by Russell T Davies, *Judge Dredd*. I don't have any hobbies aside from watching movies and scrolling through Reddit. I'm a little hopeful that sometime can help me but if you can it'd be much appreciated.
