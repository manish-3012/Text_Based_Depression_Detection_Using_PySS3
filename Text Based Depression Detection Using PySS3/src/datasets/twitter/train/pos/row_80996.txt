Remember when quarantine started a year ago? I know a lot of people were scared, but for me it kind of felt like an adventure. I mean, this was the kind of thing that happened in movies. Nothing like this had ever happened before, so what would happen now? I was still scared, but it was more of a nervousness, like you're walking into a horror movie unsure what to expect but excited to be there.

Well, now we've all been sitting in that same movie theatre for an entire year. Not so new or interesting anymore, huh?
