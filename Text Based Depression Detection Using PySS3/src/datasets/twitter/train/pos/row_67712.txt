Release, Let Go (177) It starts from inside. That is where the good, bad or the ugly will come. It isn't what is perceived, it isn't what is seen but only, **what is felt.** 

The ups and downs, they can **all be ups, perspective.** Through the tough times lately I have been embracing how I am feeling, exhaustion, not good enough, the waves, treacherous waters or still rivers, it **all matters.**

Something that I am proud of is the connections that I have made with my inner being but then being able to express it to others. The beautiful conversations, interactions, experiences, even if sometimes they don't go the way I **expect, they still go.** 

**Expectations.** The root of most of our anxieties, pains of a human being. Subconscious conditioning of what we have felt, lived through prior and now what we are bringing to the present moment. 

**Release, Let go.**

**I love you.**
