Guys I think I just did it! The original moderator of r/Subredditinator (u/JustACanadian\_01) just told me that he likes my banner design for the subreddit, and I think I might have a shot at the Moderator position despite the 16+ rule! He says he'll watermark the image with my name and apply it! I'm so proud of myself!
