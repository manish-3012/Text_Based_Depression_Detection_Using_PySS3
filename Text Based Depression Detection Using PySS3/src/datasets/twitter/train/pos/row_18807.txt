Im not a teen anymore Hello guys

I just wanted to bid you all farewell. Today I was playing GTA V and was supposed to do a mission. 

But i parked the car i was driving. And i sat there listening to the radio about a nutjob and a housewife.

I have advanced into the boring adulthood.

Farewell teens!
