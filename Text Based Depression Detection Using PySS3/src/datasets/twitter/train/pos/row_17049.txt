A spider just spawned in front of my face an then got under my bed tf should I do So I was watching YouTube on my bed and suddenly I see something centimeters in front of my face,I realized that it was a spidey boi I got up while repeating "ok,ok,ok" out loud until i turned on the lights.I started looking for him and there he was he also got off the bed.I was on the floor and I was looking at him.I didn't know what to use to kill him,I eventually decided I could use the carpet but by the time I was preparing for the attack,he was halfway under my bed,and I can't look for him because the bed is super low to the ground. I feel a mixture of disgust,anger and fear I have to go to sleep in like 1 hr tf should I do?
