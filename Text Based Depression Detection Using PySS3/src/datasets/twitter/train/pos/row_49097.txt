I did some experiments My first experiment was - how long can an average kid run? 

In january, a year ago i went outside and decided to do this experiment. It took me 4 hours and around 20 minutes to run 11km (i speak dont miles). I didnt run fast cuz i wanned to save energy but im sure i can do better now.

And no sleep experiment. My score was 40 hours. Yeah thats not that much but it was my first time. I experienced 2 hallucinations. It isnt good but i will fucking try again.

Which experiment should i do next?
