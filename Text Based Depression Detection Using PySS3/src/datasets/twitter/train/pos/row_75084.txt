life: ok you are going with the other class now in a few months

Me (December 2019): Its not like im going to be bored inside all day, I will have school and stuff

Life: lets start a pandemic

Life: sure why not

My sister: gets extra free time because she finished class early because teacher wasnt there

Me: I wish I didnt have class

Life: sure! *makes the English teacher not able to teach so we don't have class and we just do busy work*
