Trust issues Ok so I know this is going to be a long story but please read it. 

I talked to a girl for about 2 weeks (I know itâ€™s not a lot) and I started to like her. We continued to talk, we called and she gave me her Instagram (I met her on Snapchat). 

One day I asked her if she was single and she said yes. Two day later she said she needed to  unfriend me because her parent didnâ€™t want her to have a boyfriend.

I found it weird because she used to talk to me all the time but didnâ€™t said anything about her parent. Anyway I unfollowed her.

Now yesterday she followed me again so I followed her back. We talked for like four hours and then she says I have something to tell you donâ€™t be mad.

I texted her ok I wonâ€™t. And she told me that she unfriend me because she had a boyfriend.

Now I have trust issues.
