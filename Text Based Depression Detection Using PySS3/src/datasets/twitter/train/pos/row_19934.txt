If your parents constantly fight but still have positive interactions, don't worry. Hihi, noticed nowadays a lotta parents argue and many peeps dont know what to do. I want you to know:

**PARENTS ARGUING IS NORMAL, AND NOT WORRYING IN ANY WAY.**

I mean, you fight with your siblings, or even your friends. Your parents are humans and they also have emotions. Two human beings will always have differing ideas and eventually it will end.

If your parents still have positive interactions when they are not arguing, then everything is perfectly fine and normal- everyone needs a break from each other some way or the other. 

But, if your parents insult each other **CONSTANTLY (insulting rarely is not something to be worried about: you probably insulted your friend when pissed off with him/her),** then just be wary because this may be the start/in the middle of a toxic relationship you were never aware of.

**WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE ARGUING PARENTS**

Its kinda difficult to have the same behavour because of the different circumstance, but I'd advice you do something actually useful but at the same time do the things you would regularly do. 

**Try not to eavesdrop. It's none of your business.** Listen to music, or read an interesting book. Just do something that will distract you from the situations.

 **Also, don't give a shit. Using the same friendship analogy, most of your other friends don't give a crap if you are in a fight with someone else and won't get involved.** 

Lastly, don't get involved. If your parents involve you then it is their problem; not yours. 

If you guys have any other questions please leave in the comments. Thanks :)
