Random movie idea A horror movie but starring my grandparents. If your grandparents are like mine you already know whatâ€™s coming. So picture this, a guy with a scary mask and chainsaw breaks into my grandparents house. My grandfather sleeps through the entire thing and my grandmother grabs the guy by the ear and drags him down to church.
