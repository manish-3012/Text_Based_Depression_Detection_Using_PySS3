Getting my shit together before it gets bad Even though Iâ€™ve barely been a teen for under half a year Iâ€™m already starting to get stereotypical teen shit being sloppy messy room ect 
Also Iâ€™ve been going to bed at 6am and waking up at 3 which has made me feel terrible 
So today Iâ€™m pulling an all nighter with no naps and cleaning my room during it
Will keep updated
