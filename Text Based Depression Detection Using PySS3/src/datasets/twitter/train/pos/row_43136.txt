Just got threatened while riding my bike because I was wearing my dad's old police hat.... Context my father was a patrol cop/hostage negotiater for 4 years he retired before I was born and got a different job. So decided since it was raining that I was going to wear a hat, since I was a kid it's been my dream to become a cop like my dad was not for any thing else besides my dad's pride that he knew that I would carry on his legacy. So let's come back to the present. I grabbed a hat off the rack and i picked my dad's old police cap, got my mask, and headed off to the garage to get my bike and go excersise fast forward a couple minutes later i got about a street down before a couple who I was guessing were on a walk too even though it was raining (guess they like the rain as much as I do) and yelled at me and I know I heard the words perfectly "you trump suporting bitch" and this couple must've been as old as 20-25, now believe me I don't like Trump as much as the next guy I think he's a horrible person but still just because I like the police doesn't mean I support trump it's just you have to remember not all police are bad, they keep drugs off the street, they arest women abuser's and rapists, they also keep guns off the street so you or your neighbor don't get shot. So let's come back I heard the words and I just decided to ignor them and keep riding I get about 5 blocks down and then I hear the words "I swear I'll find out were you live" from the man and at this point I'm scared because these people look like the people who will do it and they were close enough to probably follow me home so I just book it home so they don't have enough time to try and figure out were I'm going and then just go straight into the garage (that I kept open because I forgot to close it with my phone) and guessing that my dad would close it and then I just look behind me just to make sure that they weren't following me and slammed the door. Then told my parents what happened needless to say that I won't be going on bike rides for a while until things cool down. Moral of the story is be careful and wear a mask and be careful. Thanks for coming to my ted talk and if you read the whole thing good job.
