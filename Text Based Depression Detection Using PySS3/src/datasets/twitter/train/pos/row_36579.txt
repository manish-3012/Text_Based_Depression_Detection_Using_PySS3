Fish girl meme This girl must be going through a really, really bad time right now. Imagine yourself in her position. Not only now, but also in a couple of months / years.

Obviously no one is going to stop sharing these kind of video's, and that's not my point.

&amp;#x200B;

But if we are the ones to judge her, then we should also be the ones to take responsibility for that. In this case I think the internet's judgement is at fault here. Not specific individuals per se, but as a collective this meme has gotten out of hand and I believe Jordyn is suffering.

Help her out!

Don't forget: the internet's judgement carries a quite disproportional sentence with it.

We should be mindfull, responsible and fair if we are to collectively act as judges and excecutioners.
