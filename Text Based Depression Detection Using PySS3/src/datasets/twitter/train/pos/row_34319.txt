High and deep thoughts. Hi Iâ€™m new to reddit and not the savviest with well, anything. But Iâ€™m interested to see everyoneâ€™s different type of memes and their favourite type. I donâ€™t really know if Iâ€™ve explained this well at all so what Iâ€™m trying to say is I have different friends that different interests completely unrelated to each other so I need to choose which meme is suitable to which friend. For example dark memes will be shared with a closer friend who I know doesnâ€™t have any hidden background links to the meme to cause upset or anger. Iâ€™m really interested to see whether this is the same in other places of the world. (Probably because Iâ€™m High)
