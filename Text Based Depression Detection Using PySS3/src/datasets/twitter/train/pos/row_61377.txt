Someone was unmuted... We were preparing for a small project in Spanish (that is honestly kind of easy) and one kid just yelled calling it stupid while nobody was really talking, making it much worse. I feel bad because everyone laughed and they now have to stay after class :(

Moral of the story, make sure you are muted before exclaiming your anger.
