A comprehensive guide on how to get a gf 

you know, during the las vegas shooting, Stephen Paddock supposedly spent over 3,000 rounds of ammunition over the course of 10 minutes from 27 ar15s with bumpstocks despite the fact that that would require him to drop a gun after each 30 round magazine was emptied and videos from the survivors shows there was a non-stop stream of bullets with a firing much higher than a bumpstock is capable of producing shooting from multiple locations which shows to be an m240 lmgs. after the fbi took over the investigation his house somehow burnt down along with all the evidence and photos of his hotel room, where he shot from, show only about 50 spent shells years later, we still don't know his motivation and there was strangely no followup on the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history.
