DUDE MY CRUSH THINKS I'M GAY why the fuck can't I just... not act gay? I act gay, I look gay, my hobbies are "gay", I dress gay, I sound gay, and EVERYONE THINKS I'M GAY

I'm really not gay, and I know I'm not because there's been like 2 dudes who I've even thought about dating. one is Enzo, and he's a dreamy mf that everyone wants to date. and the other is a fucking youtuber

just..  why am I like this?
