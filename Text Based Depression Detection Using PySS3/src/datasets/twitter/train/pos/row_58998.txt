I kinda want to start a nonprofit to help rape victims This is a bit of a rant, so sorry but I never realized how bad it was and to what extent people were forced into it. Iâ€™ve never thought haha rape okay but I never really realized that what happened was much worse. So, Iâ€™m so sorry if this makes me sound weird but thereâ€™s a song by Nirvana called Polly [this video](https://youtu.be/NJ97KdTQFww) goes in to explain what that  songâ€™s about and you should watch it. Ok so back to the main thing I want to do something with the  Years that I have thrown down the drain of rejecting it. So is there anything that truly helps victims? Charities anything? Please send me links in the comments I want to at the very least give back a little bit or at least try
