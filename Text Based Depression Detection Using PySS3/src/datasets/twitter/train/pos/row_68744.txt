10 Things that are hard for lefties 1. Scissors
2. Can openers
3. Writing in a ring binder
4. Writing in general (especially if next to a right handed person)
5. Scissors again (they are the bane of my life)
6. Sports- everything is set up for right handed people
7. Mugs (the handle is often on the wrong side so the picture is facing the wrong way, this also includes measuring jugs)
8. Picking up other peoples drinks- once I accidentally picked up someone's g&amp;t thinking it was my water :(
9. Ice cream scoops
10. Computer keyboards and mouses

There's almost definitely other things that I can't think of right now. Brought to you by a lefty.
