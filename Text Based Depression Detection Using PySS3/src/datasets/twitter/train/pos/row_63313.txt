Pissed at parents with high expectations Iâ€™m so fucking angry.

My parents literally expect me to take all advanced and APs, get into an Ivy League, and be all super successful or whatever.

But they treat me like shit. I always babysit my brother and clean up around the house, with not so much as a thank you. If I get a bad grade Iâ€™m pressured by them to feel like Iâ€™m a failure. They always try to plan out my life for me. They donâ€™t respect my point of view and if it differs from theirs then Iâ€™m â€œbullyingâ€ them. Sometimes if Iâ€™m â€œbullyingâ€ them theyâ€™ll start screaming at me for hours, just telling me Iâ€™m a failure and a disappointment. If I bring up other failures of theirs as parents then Iâ€™m â€œbullyingâ€ them. 

Nothing I do is ever good enough, if Iâ€™m at the top of my class â€œwell, you could do betterâ€. If I got 100s across the board for a project I worked my ass off on, â€œitâ€™s okay.. but not good enough. You shouldâ€™ve listened to meâ€. 

And if I have any reaction besides â€œoh youâ€™re right, I am a failureâ€, then Iâ€™m â€œbullyingâ€ them. 

Yet Iâ€™m supposed to keep being this perfect, straight A student? I feel like theyâ€™re just trying to make me into this work producing robot because Iâ€™m not allowed to have a personality, opinion, or any interests unless it aligns with what they want.

And Iâ€™m not even getting into the worst of it.. 

So yeah, I guess I didnâ€™t post this on vent cause I felt like yâ€™all might be able to relate..
