A finland fact for every day #14 Finland (and the nordics in general) do not care about religion. Yes they all are lutherian but it does not matter. In the 1500s when the reformation happened, king of sweden (which controlled finland at the time) chose the religion to be lutherian. That is why they all are. But it does not really matter. Most people are baptized because of tradition but are in actuality atheists or undecided. The church does not have much power and people depend on science way more.
