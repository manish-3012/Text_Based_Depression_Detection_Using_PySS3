Did you know that elon musk didn't create tesla or PayPal. All he did was invest money in those companies, become ceo and make the founders quit cause of his terrible leadership. Did you know the reason he got fired from paypal was because everyone was sick of his terrible decisions? He was never founder of either companies but he continues to lie to everyone by saying that he created them.
