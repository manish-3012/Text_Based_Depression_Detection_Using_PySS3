My Mom said that I can either download life360 and turn on Google maps location sharing or I can pay rent and food A bit of context: I have had life360 and Google maps location sharing for a really long time. I just turned 18 a couple of weeks ago, and since then my parents are saying that I can do whatever I want, because I'm 18.
Sounds good right? 

So I tought, hey if I can do whatever I want, i'll just delete life360 and the Google maps thing. Well my mother just came into my room and explained that if I'm such an adult and I can do whatever I want, then I should have no problem paying for my rent and food. She said that I have to decide tonight. What should I do?
