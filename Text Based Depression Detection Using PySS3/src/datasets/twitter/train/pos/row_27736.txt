Am I being too sensitive? Well, I'm probably what you call an indoors kid, and I was never involved in sports, which resulted in me basically sucking at all kinds of sports. I've been made fun of quite a lot because of it, making me not only feeling insecure and not wanting to try due to being afraid of getting laughed at. I've been trying to improve myself physically for the past 2 years although not routinely, just jogging sometimes, in home aerobic exercises and the likes.

Well today, one of my best friends asked if I wanted to go play badminton with her families and some other friends as well (one being my crush oof). While I'm an awkward guy around people I'm not familiar with, I also obviously suck at badminton (I can catch some but not much) . She said something along the lines of "Well it doesn't really matter if you go or not" which to be honest kinda hurt me. While she said it kinda in a jokingly fashion, I still can't help thinking about it. 

I've been wanting to find a friend who is willing to slowly help me in improving myself physically and someone who doesn't give a fuck if I suck at sports or not. Basically someone who is willing to accompany, help me and of course, not laugh at me when I'm already trying my best.

 For some more information, I also went with her and some friends in our circle to play badminton once in a while, which probably counts as me taking the first step in improving myself? Maybe it's because I was made fun of previously due to sucking at physical activities, but I can't seem to not take her comment/remark to heart. What do you guys think?
