Has anyone ever thought about Discord becoming an outdated chat service like MySpace in the future? Like image talking to your future kids and saying something like, â€œI remember back when I used Discord to meet my close friends.â€ Back in my momâ€™s day MySpace was their Discord, it was popular, and you could met new people easily. But now thatâ€™s SUPER outdated, and we just have to move on course change is inevitable.
