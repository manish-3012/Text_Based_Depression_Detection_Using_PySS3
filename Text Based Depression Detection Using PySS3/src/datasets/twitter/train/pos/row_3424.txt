i am proud of you i didn't know who you are or when you will read this and you didn't know who am I but i am proud of you as a bro and honestly i think you couldn't do best . i am not here to be the annoying  virtue signal trash. but as a random bro just lay back, stop what you doing and think of something that you genuinly proud that happened in your country /the world and you think is great that it happened in your lifetime. something that happened when you were alive and be proud of it silently . goodbye and have a good life  . to never
