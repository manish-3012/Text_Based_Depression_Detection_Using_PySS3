why is existing so hard lol seriously idk if iâ€™m just weird or what. talking to people is so hard and i feel like iâ€™m just weird at this point haha. it seems like if you say anything thoughtful or make jokes that donâ€™t fit our generations specific humor, people shut down and think youâ€™re weird. 

even posting on here itâ€™s like... is that a weird thing to post ? will people get it? iâ€™ll just not.. do that. but here i am. venting lol. i hope no one else feels like this :/
