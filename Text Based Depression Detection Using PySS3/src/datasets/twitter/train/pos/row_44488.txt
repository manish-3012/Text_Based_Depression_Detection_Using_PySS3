It would mean a lot if you would take your time to read this. Thank you! I was dumped by my gf months ago and she lied to everyone about me, like I didn't care about her, but I did, and that I didn't understand her problems. How am I supposed to understand them if she never told me about them? Plus she hid them, so I couldn't even tell if something was wrong. So every girl started hating me in my class and make fun of me and talk stuff behind my back and shout my head off for everything. Once I asked for the homework in a groupchat and they told me that this isn't the right groupchat for asking homework, but when an other boy asked they told them without shouting his head off, or once I was going to be late from the lesson, so I got in the classroom from the window and I didn't know my shoe had so much dirt on it, so someone's table got dirty, and they are shouting my head off, and saying that just because I don't care about anything I should care about the stuff around me, but how could have I known? I cleaned the table, and even offered to wash the girl's jacket, but still they don't care about it and start saying stuff behind my back. So I started to say out what I thought, like when they were complaining I said: Shut up, and stop complaining! Maybe I was too mean. And when I said some things behind their back (like they are stupid and my ex is a bitch) they come at me like how dare I call them a bitch, but I didn't, I only called my ex a bitch. I feel really bad, and I'm starting to think that I am a bad person. What do you think? This is the only place I can tell this, because I don't want to talk to my parents about this and my friends don't give a shit about it. I posted this so late, because I just can't handle it now, things aren't going well at all and this is just making it worse. And sorry for making it too long. (English isn't my main language, so sorry if there is a mistake in the text.)
