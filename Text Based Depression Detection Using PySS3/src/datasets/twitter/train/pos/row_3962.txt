I don't really feel hate, anyone else? I don't really feel hate about anything really, like you could be Hitler or a fucking pedo and I wouldn't feel any proper hatred. I mean If I had the choice I would definitely kill both but I just assume that when a bad person dies they will come to their senses and their punishment is the guilt they have to endure. Even if someone directly harmed me or smthn I still wouldn't really hate them. Anyone else?
