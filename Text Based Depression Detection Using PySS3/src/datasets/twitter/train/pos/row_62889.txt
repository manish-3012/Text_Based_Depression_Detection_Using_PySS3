Why does anyone have the delusion that the school boards care about students well being? Last year, we signed petitions against an alternating, A-B days type schedule. EVERYONE HATED THE MERE IDEA. This year, during virtual learning amidst a pandemic, THEY DID IT ANYWAYS, FFS. It has DOUBLED our workload. Some people have four to FIVE AP classes at ONCE. Any insane, unnecessary changes that made your life worse at school and out? How are the people who make these decisions so out of touch with students and faculty?
