who here has tried drugs, never tried drugs, and who somewhat consistently use drugs? sadly polls don't work, also i'd be interested to know when you first tried a drug recreationally, i was 10-11 but technically i didn't inhale, first time for real i was 12.(also just say you haven't tried drugs don't be like drugs are bad and i shouldn't do them bc i rlly don't care lol)
