does my crush like me? so this girl and i have known each other for about a year now, just friends. now we made "insults" about each others       last names, her last name is peltonen and pelto in finnish means field and i kinda made peltonenÃ¤ wich means field nose(yes it is dumb) and she made one of mine (my last name is selkee wich means clear (like clearly etc). epÃ¤selkee wich means unclear 

now she has started to flip my cap off when i am wearing it(with a kind smile idk its not evil). i have no fucking idea does she like me or not.

when i told my mom she said that she likes me.

sorry if there are any mistakes or weird splices of words
