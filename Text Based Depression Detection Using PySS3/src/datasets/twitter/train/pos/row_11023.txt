Help with upcoming â€œdateâ€ ASAP So there is a girl that I work with. Iâ€™m going to go watch a movie in the back of her car with her cause theatres are closed. We also text kind of frequently. Iâ€™m not sure if it is a date or what if is. Should I try something when we do meet up or what do I do?
