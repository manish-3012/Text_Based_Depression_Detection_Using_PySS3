Is it just me or is it EXTREMELY ANNOYING when someone defines their best friends by who they have on their best fiends list on snap? I had gone to a friends house yesterday just to game and stuff yk, just a causal game hangout and we got to the topic of friends and who our best friends were. He then proceeded to list all his friends on his best friends list on snap.
