Should I ask out this girl that I like? Gonna delete soon cos someone stalks me lol

So basically Iâ€™m 16 and I have never had a gf nor have I ever asked anyone out before. I met this girl via mutual friends and she is like seriously one of the kindest people that I have ever met.

I know people are going to say â€œYes ask her outâ€ and etc. but I am a scared little pussy.

My problem in this situation is that I am good friends with her and we both talk about life on Snapchat in our spare time until like 12 in the morning. Iâ€™m not sure if she does that with just me or she is just kind enough to do that and also does this with other people.

So back to the problem, she is one of my friends and she also shares a mutual class with me at school. I really want to ask her out but if she says no Iâ€™m scared that our friendship will end and she will like..... not be friends with me or something. 

So what is your call on my situation? Iâ€™m not asking her out face to face because fuck that Iâ€™m a pussy but like via social media?

Sheâ€™s really kind so she isnâ€™t the type to go around and say â€œHey ____ just asked me out LMFAO ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚â€.
