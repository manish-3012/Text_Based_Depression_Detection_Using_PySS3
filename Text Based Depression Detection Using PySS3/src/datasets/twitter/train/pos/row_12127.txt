why am I being ignored? sounds like a selfish thing to ask, but this is my first interaction with a women, so I rlly need advice.
k, here's the situation, so, were online friends, and we kind of fell for each other. we talked alot, and by alot, I mean alot, I can't scroll all the way up in a 5 day conversation, we live in very different time zones, so tgis might be one of the causes, I rlly don't know. but anyways, I was having a meltdown, I have depression, and I had a rlly bad day, and so as we were talking to each other, I asked her to never leave me, she said she won't. the next day, I wake up. feel better and apologies for what the meltdown I had. she said it's alright, so I asked her how her day was
got no reply in a day, the next day she tells me "sry I was busy" that was the last message I got from her. now I'm being ignored for over a week, I'm not worried about myself, I'm worried about her, I constantly am telling her to have a great day and all. basically, I'm guessing I fucked up somewhere, I don't know where. please help
