Nineteen year oldâ€™s maleâ€™s advice for NNN. Itâ€™s fucking stupid. Donâ€™t do it

Do what you have to do. Youâ€™re causing yourself unnecessary stress. You might be taking tests right now, you might be going through stressful times right now, you might be around people that activate hormones that make you act  poorly. Itâ€™s better to release that.

No shave November makes more sense. If itâ€™s about awareness for male cancers, do no shave. 

Also, donâ€™t talk about it around girls. No one wants to hear about you masturbating, saying that youâ€™re not masturbating implies that you were. Itâ€™s fucking weird.
