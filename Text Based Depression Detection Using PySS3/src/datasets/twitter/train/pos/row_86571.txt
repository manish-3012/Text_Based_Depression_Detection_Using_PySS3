Those 3 words I've been dating one of my best friends for a month now, her birthday is next month and I wanna tell her that I love her. I have it planned out in my head, I'm gonna get her the album that bonded us together and I'm gonna take her on a date and give it to her. I need to know if my plan is a good idea or not. I need advice from you guys.
