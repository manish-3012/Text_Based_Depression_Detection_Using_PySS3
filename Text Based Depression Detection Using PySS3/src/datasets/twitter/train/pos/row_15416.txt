Getting scared at random moments again They've been gone for almost three months.. until yesterday. They came back.

I dont know what to do, if I tell my mum she'll get too worried, my doctor doesnt believe me fsr. My friends are amazing, but they obviously cant do anything..

Gotta say.. been a long time since I've gotten scared I'm fucking maths class.

Idk what to do.. some advice would really be appreciated, thanks
