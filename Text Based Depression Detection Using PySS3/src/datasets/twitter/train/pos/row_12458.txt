Is it wrong to be scared of being gay? Ok, before you imeaditly downvote, let me explain. I completely respect all LGBTQ people around me and have nothing against them. I understand they have their own preferences and that it's nothing that should be discriminated against. Lately, ive seen some posts on this sub about homosexual relationships and they got me thinking about how id feel if I werent as straight as I thought I was. I started to feel anxious and scared about what if this happened and when i realized my reaction, i sort of felt guilty. I just want to know if I'm a bad person for feeling this way, or if thos feeling is more normal than i thought.

(If I deserve it, please downvote me to hell. I'm sorry if ive insulted anyone with this post)
