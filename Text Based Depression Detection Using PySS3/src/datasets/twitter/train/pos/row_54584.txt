trans guy here (i think) so, iâ€™m pretty sure iâ€™m trans, but i am having a really hard time because i will never be a real man, and all of my friends know me as a female. i fucking hate it. i am also attracted to males, but i feel like people would just be confused or irritated if i said i was a dude who still wears makeup and likes guys, which i know there are those guys out there and they are amazing, it just seems like when it comes to myself i just feel like people wonâ€™t like me. i wish i was born a male so it wouldnâ€™t be like this. i donâ€™t know what to do because i might be wrong and then everyone will think i was just lying for clout.

one of the main things though is that i like this guy and he likes me back but i feel like iâ€™m lying to him because in my head i feel like a male and heâ€™s straight, it really hurts.
