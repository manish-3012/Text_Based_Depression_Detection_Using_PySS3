I think my parents ruined dating/relationships for me and I resent them for it So basically my parents are strict when it comes to dating. They never let me talk to boys, hang out with them, blah blah blah typical parent stuff. I lost my virginity about 2 years ago and my parents essentially disowned me for a year. Now Iâ€™m gonna go to college in a few months and theyâ€™re like â€œnows your time to date and do all the stuff you couldnâ€™t do.â€ And now I kinda just donâ€™t want to. I dont find myself wanting a relationship anymore, I donâ€™t find sex addictive, I donâ€™t want to bring home a gf or bf to them. Ever since that day they flipped out a switch just kinda went off in me. I get irritated when they talk about relationship stuff to me now. I completely just zone out. I want to cry because I feel like they ruined something really special for me. Not only just dating but with friendships. I wasnâ€™t allowed to hang out with guy friends and most girls hung out with guys. I never went to any parties. My social life is completely nonexistent and theyâ€™re like â€œwhy donâ€™t you ever do anything, these are your years to hang out with your girl friends and have fun.â€ But I donâ€™t have any girl friends. I donâ€™t have friends at all. Iâ€™ve never been to a sleepover because they wouldnâ€™t let me. When I used to think of my future I used to think of having friends and doing fun stuff. Now I can only picture myself alone. Living alone, traveling alone, and maybe visiting my family once a year. I resent my parents for it.
