BS â€œunexcused absencesâ€ My school is hybrid (in school some days and online other days).  On the days we are online, we have to go into a website and fill out an attendance form.  Some days, I forgot to do this, and the school sent my family a fine for having too many â€œunexcused absencesâ€.  The thing is, I did the work!  It was only a stupid little form I forgot to fill out.  This is maybe the most asinine thing the district has ever done to us.  Iâ€™m not even the only one who is having this problem; many students and their families are being sent these fines!  Anyone else having problems with this?
