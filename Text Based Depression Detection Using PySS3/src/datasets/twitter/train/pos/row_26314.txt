Why do you guys hate muslims? Ok so Iook I am a Muslim and I live in Saudia 
I am asking this question because I was having a discussion with one guy on reddit so to prove my point I literally said that I am a Muslim after a while he didn't reply but I saw like 23 down votes like I just told someone I am a muslim and some people were like nope you gotta get  a down vote.
I don't actually care about the down vote but people have a lot of misconceptions about muslims if you have any questions I can answer them we have been stereotyped into bad people but actually we are not 
And I really dont like bringing religion and stuff where people are not talking about it but I just wanted to ask btw  I am 17 so that's why I posted it here
