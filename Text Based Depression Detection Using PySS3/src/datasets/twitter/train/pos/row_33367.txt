I recently had a confidence click! I was just chilling and thinking about shit and then BOOM! Just happened

Now I feel like I could comfortably talk to strangers IRL, and I have no idea how it happened. Before there was nooooo way I was gonna do that lmao

Idk if this will help you guys who havenâ€™t had that click yet but, GO FOR IT! TALK TO PEOPLE! WHY NOT THERES NOTHING TO LOSE. No one gives a fuck about what you do unless it fucks with them and how could you without trying??? Just go for it lads, at least make an effort, maybe youâ€™ll get your click.

And guys, good luck. Itâ€™s a great feeling and I hope every single one of you get this experience yourself. If any of you need extra help with that search up JP Phillips on YouTube he really helped tbh.
