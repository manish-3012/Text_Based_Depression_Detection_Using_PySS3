I'm fucking done. My mom has recently gotten into a relationship.

This is the second fucking time in a year.


My Step-dad, whom I was very close with talks to me still and even though she broke up with him, he had been my replacement dad since my dad left when I was two due to internal problems.

She started being "friends" with one guy, he slashed her tires, and she was like "there was no proof!", especially when it's the only person who could of done it.

Now she's dating another man, not even a year after the incident with the other man, and only a year and a half from breaking up with my step-dad.


And when I woke up this morning (I've been staying over at his house because I've been getting really bad depression because of family fighting)


I hear the two fucking, and I'm tempted to stomp my foot on the ground out of anger.
