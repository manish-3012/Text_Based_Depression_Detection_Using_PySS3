I told my crush how I feel about her and asked if I could kiss her. She asked where and we didnâ€™t really have time to kiss. I donâ€™t know what to do. Hey so I told my crush how I feel about her and stuff and she said that she would think about it and stuff. She told me that she never said I wasnâ€™t her type even though I thought I wasnâ€™t her type of guy. I asked if I could kiss her and she said yes but we didnâ€™t have time bc we were in school. 

Could I get some advice on where to go from here. Iâ€™m kinda bad at love.
