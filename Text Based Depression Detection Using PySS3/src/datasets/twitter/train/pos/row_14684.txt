just a little vent (I really just needed to talk to someone aha) (sorry if itâ€™s the wrong flair Iâ€™m new here) 
so about two years ago I got diagnosed with minor autism. at first I didnâ€™t think much of it as it wouldnâ€™t change who I was, and it never will. but others didnâ€™t think the same. Iâ€™ve always had troubles with school, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s difficult, I just think itâ€™s incredibly boring. like so boring I would rather do anything else in the world than go there. so Iâ€™ve spent most of my school days at home rather than at school. and now finally, my parents had something to blame it on. donâ€™t get me wrong, I love my parents, theyâ€™re really nice, but they seem to not understand that all their comments about my autism being the cause for all of this hurt me. almost every single adult Iâ€™ve met who knows about my autism seems to assume that I must have troubles with EVERYTHING just because Iâ€™m autistic. itâ€™s always annoyed me, but for the past few months I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t hate myself. I love who I am. but I hate my autism. if everyone stopped making such a big deal out of it then I would live the perfect life. (not really, but much better than this hellhole) every time someone comments on it Iâ€™m close to breaking out in tears because of how done I am. every time they tell me something new I have troubles with I donâ€™t understand how they always forget about everything I DONT have troubles with. they NEVER talk about the good things about me, only bad things. I literally taught myself English from just staring at a computer screen all day. school didnâ€™t teach me anything. but no, thatâ€™s not important, cause I must be a complete idiot because I have this label under my name. I cry myself to sleep almost every single night just thinking about how much better my life would be if I wasnâ€™t like this. and I know you might just say â€œbut just go to school! itâ€™ll fix your problems!â€ thats not gonna help. I donâ€™t even know why I donâ€™t go most of the time. I just canâ€™t. anyways thanks for tuning in today for anjas ted talk. have a nice day!!
