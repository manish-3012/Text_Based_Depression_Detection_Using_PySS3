What do you think of the cool space stuff happening this year? I just found out NASA will launch a successor to the Hubble and will orbit an Apollo like spaceship around the Moon and back later this year. Also SpaceX is working on the first fully reusable spaceship and will fly a cancer survivor on a Crew Dragon in benefit for St. Jude.

Also space debris have lit up the sky in Seattle.

Are we entering a new exciting age of space travel and space exploration or have we already entered the new space age when SpaceX first flew a cargo ship to the ISS?

And for some reason the superpowers want to build "scientific outposts" on the Moon.

It really seems like humans will be able to land on Mars by the 2030s.
