Hey you, Iâ€™ve got a nice story to tell you guys that happened to me the other day Also, I will be referring myself as inverse pie

So, on Thursday at school, I was walking back to my desk at the back of the classroom when my crush called me to come to her desk, I walked there and asked her if she needed help with something, she then just straight up says: can I borrow your jacket?
So I kinda just looked at her and said â€œokâ€ without questioning it, so I lend  her my jacket I was wearing and as I was walking back she said: haha! Iâ€™ve stolen inverse pieâ€™s jacket. I twist around and look at her, she has put on the jacket and you have no idea how fucking adorable she looked, she looked at me and said â€œwhy is your jacket so big?â€
I just told her: I thought you knew I was tall. She held on to it until the end of the school day and gave it back to me

TL;DR: my crush borrows my jacket, looks fucking adorable, gives it back to me at the end of the day and I donâ€™t know why weâ€™re still not dating.
