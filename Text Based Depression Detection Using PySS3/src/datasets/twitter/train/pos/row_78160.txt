So.... an update to my earlier post Anyways... so itâ€™s been a long way since summer, and Iâ€™ve grown a lot as a person, I met this awesome and stunningly beautiful girl at the start of school and we are going 3 weeks strong in a serious relationship, but Iâ€™ve also realized how much of a problem it is to always to be horny and I feel like Iâ€™m burdening my GF with my extremely high sex drive, although she always helps me out in one way or another I feel bad because she isnâ€™t just a piece of meat that I call when Iâ€™m horny you know? And she is just a great person who Iâ€™m afraid to lose, is there any way I can control my sex drive and hormones?
