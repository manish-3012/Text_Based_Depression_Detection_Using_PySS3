I dropped a prized ornament and my Grandmother made me feel like shit. So we were decorating, and she gave me a prized ornament of hers. It was of an artist who I can't remember. So I accidently dropped it. She then went on to compare me to her when she was helping her mom decorate. I hate people like this. Comparison isn't motivation to be better. and i felt like shit until my grandpa got home. He then asked me what was wrong and i started bawling. I hate to make my grandparents feel bad so I just couldn't hold it in. My grandma then goes "I'm the victim here, and you're comforting him" Now, she's turning it to a aggressor-victim thing. Then, when he does try to comfort her, she says "I don't need your comforting!" She is annoying in times like this, but i still love her, as she can be nice and friendly 89% of the time.
