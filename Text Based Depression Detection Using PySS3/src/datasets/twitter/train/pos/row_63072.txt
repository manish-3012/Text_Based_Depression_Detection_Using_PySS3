Can't read romance. I grew up reading fanfiction, so now I can read smut and watch porn stone faced, no reaction. But the fuckin minute someone presents me with a cute ship, with them doing cute things and generally being adorable, I start giggling like a little bastard. I can barely even read it cuz I keep putting my phone down. How does that work!?
