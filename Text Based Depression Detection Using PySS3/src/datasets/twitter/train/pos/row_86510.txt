Help please I met a someone here like last Friday, she was very nice we spoke like Friday and Saturday and she went complete radio silence no activity on discord or Reddit, looking at her post history I saw she tried to commit suicide 4 days ago but her parents found out before she could, now I'm worried she actually did it, I have no way of confirming my suspicions and I'm felling really sick, I can't think straight. Can someone help.
