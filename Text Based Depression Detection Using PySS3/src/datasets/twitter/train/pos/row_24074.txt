Im scared I don't have anyone to tell. I have a fingernail infection which is fine, but it's gone quite bad. It hasn't gone beyond the tip but it's swelling up a lot, hurts and yellow-green a bit under the nail. I can't even hold a pen and in just over a week I have to do an entire month of exams, I don't know how I'm gonna do anything, I even woke up before 6am because it hurts. It's been a week. Sorry if it was graphic, I don't need anyone to talk but I need to tell someone.
