Sorry about this School has been kicking my ass recently. I have really high expectations for myself and I'm definitely my own worst critic which is something I'm working on but school isnt helping recently. I have 2 major projects that I'm supposed to be half way done by now and I've only started one. My English teacher keeps assigning stuff and I can't keep up. I'm so tired from staying up working that every morning that I'm struggling to pay attention in my class. Unfortunately when I'm stressed I procrastinate my work so that makes it even worse. In my other class theres a class wide assignment and my parts supposed to be done today but I'm not even close. I've had so many late assignments from English class and I feel like I dont have any energy left. Everyones telling me I'm exaggerating my problems which is probably true bc I currently have a really good average but if I keep this up I won't. Sorry again I just needed to talk somewhere
