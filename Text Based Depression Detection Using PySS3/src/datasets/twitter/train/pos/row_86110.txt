Abusive people It makes me feel so shit when abusive people are lucky to be able to find people who make them happy, whereas the quiet people who just wanna give someone the world canâ€™t find anyone and get played (gonna use myself and my best friend as potential examples lol). My ex gf was super abusive and effectively raped me but canâ€™t get done bc thereâ€™s no evidence and we was both underage so Iâ€™d probs be the one who gets done or she could say I did it to her. This was over a year and a half ago, we broke up like a year and a bit ago and sheâ€™s been in relationship(s) since us whereas Iâ€™ve just been played by every girl. My best friends ex was abusive to him mentally and now sheâ€™s in a happy relationship and heâ€™s really struggling so itâ€™s shit because he deserves to be happy :(
