I declare king of this subreddit. It is me. Bow to me. While I may not be God of it, queen of it, I sure declare myself the king. 

Sure, there are people far more successful than me, I understand. But every victory calls for celebration. 

Today I made out with a girl and she gave me a hickey. She is also one of the coolest people I've met so far, cooler than probably my friends. I've also lost my virginity so.. I already am higher up than most of y'all. 

To add to that, two days in a row, two A's in a row. I've been praised for setting examples the teacher used for the entire class. I have become legend in my school for being able to sing rap god perfectly. 

A girl told me I'm so attractive I could get any girl I want. This isn't fantasy, my friends. It's reality. Bow to your king.
