I finally got the nerve and confidence and I was planning on asking my crush out next time I saw herâ€”Fridayâ€” but then I stumbled upon her Pinterest... Kinda a clickbait title... but also kinda not. 

She has a pin on couples pictures with like 60 posts and I honestly feel less inspired to ask her out. While  Iâ€™m here thinking about how cute they are and how I would def recreate them, itâ€™s also got me thinking About if she sees me in those, and what if I disappoint her. 

Idk man, Iâ€™m losing the battle to anxiety rn
