This should probably go on Unpopular Opinions But saying you won't date a race just bc they're that race is racist. I'm tired of hearing "I wOnT dAtE wHiTe PeOpLe" and "dAtInG bLaCk PeOpLe Is OvErRaTeD" which is another reason why I hate tiktok (that's where that mindset was created).



Coming from a black person, I don't care what this caucasian person did to you or even did to us, that is not a reason to spread racist propaganda.



Thanks for coming to my tedtalk.
