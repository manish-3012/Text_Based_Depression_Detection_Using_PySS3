Advice pls... I've been self-harming without realizing it for years just for the sake to feel pain... But now I'm emotionally shattered due to recent events and for the past couple of weeks, everything I look at tells me mentally how this item can be used against me as harm. I'm trying to fight the temptation to "cut" but I don't think I can hold back much longer. It gets worst daily. I've never intentionally cut and don't want to start yet my emotional pain and anger is telling me otherwise...

Evertime I look at something sharp the first thing I think of is cutting, and avoiding these thoughts has become a challenge I'm going to eventually loose...
