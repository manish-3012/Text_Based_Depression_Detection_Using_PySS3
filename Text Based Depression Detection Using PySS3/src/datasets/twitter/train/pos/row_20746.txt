Middle school sucked damn I was a relatively normal child up until 5th grade,I moved to America almost at the end of that school year and it was so awful,I had only 3 teachers but only my homeroom teacher was nice to me the history teacher was neutral but the math teacher was just straight up TERRIBLE,she had a bad reputation and thankfully she was absent most of the time I was there,but 3 months of her presence made me go from a socially normal child to extremely anxious around my surroundings and shy(man I hate that woman,some day Iâ€™ll dance on her grave if I get the chance)6th grade was ok-meh,I was still extremely shy but not as anxious,I felt lonely most of the time because I had only like 5 friends in total but they made me feel a little better :),7th grade,I was more self aware and had more friends,the teachers were mostly ok except for one of the PE teachers which is not as bad tbh(note,I changed schools every grade up until 8th grade) now 8th grade(last year)I was ANGRY,my acne scars were really noticeable and that made me feel sad all the time,I canâ€™t really tell if it was depression because Iâ€™m much better without really any treatment or anything but I definitely had the symptoms,I hated looking at my face,I felt that there was no point on styling my hair,dress nicely,or even basic hygiene because if my skin looked bad I would just look gross no matter what I did,I would be mad at everyone because middle schoolers are cruel and I felt I had to be defensive all the time even around my friends,if a guy said he liked me Iâ€™d treat him badly because he was probably joking because câ€™mon,who would like that right?i hurt a lot of people that care about me and I was hoping I could apologize when the school year started but thatâ€™s not much of an option right now.if you read all this ty for getting this far
