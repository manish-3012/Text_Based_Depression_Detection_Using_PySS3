Fuck chemistry I fucking hate chemistry. It makes about as much sense as half the shit i see in r/DIWHY. Like, i understand that math is used quite frequently in science and i can respect that, but for chemistry, its more like fucking history in the sense that you just have to remember shit and most of it is impossible to remember. Like the molar mass for  C3H4S7Na10FE9 like what the actual fucking hell. How in the hell are we supposed to know that shit, like are we supposed to memorize the entire period table and the molar mass of all the fucking elements? In conclusion, fuck chemistry and all it fucking stands for.
