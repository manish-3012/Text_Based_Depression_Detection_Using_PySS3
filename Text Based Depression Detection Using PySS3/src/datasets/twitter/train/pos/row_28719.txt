Whatâ€™s this feeling 

Things I use to find fun are just slowly going away. Anything I do feels like a waste. Even talking to my friends isnâ€™t fun anymore. Each and everyday of mine is getting longer and longer I feel like Iâ€™ve given up and I have one last thread of hope my school grades have all fallen and Iâ€™m getting more and more tired as the weeks go on it feels like itâ€™s been years synced this has been happening but in reality itâ€™s only been three weeks it gets worse and worse I canâ€™t keep the thoughts out of my head I just want it to end I just want it to stop the longer I wait the the worse it gets it feels like Iâ€™m screaming into an eternal darkness that will only ever end with death and I donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™ve given up

Thanks for coming to the Ted of talks
