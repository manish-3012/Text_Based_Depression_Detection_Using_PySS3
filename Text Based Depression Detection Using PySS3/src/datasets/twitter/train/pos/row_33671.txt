I feel like an American I finally mustered the courage to make an appointment with a therapist. Hurray! So I went online, checked how to do it and then I saw the fee wasn't covered. I'll be damned. My broke ass isn't going to pay 60â‚¬ to rant at someone with a PhD. Instant ramen will have to listen to my rant meanwhile.

Now I know how someone feel when they can't get medical care because it's too expensive. While my case isn't that bad I'm sorry for people not having universal health care. Truly I hope the world becomes a better place before self imploding.
