I have no idea what iâ€™m doing First off, Iâ€™m fucking terrified. Got a few tests coming up, which usually I would be calm about **except** this year because of COVID, â€œEvery test could be used as your final exam grade if exams are cancelledâ€. Particularly worried because my school has a nasty habit of setting impossible tests to scare us with shit marks, so even though Iâ€™m alright with past paper questions, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll fail these tests. 

Also what the fuck am I even doing. Iâ€™ve spent the last year or so just doing things to try and get into top unis but honestly I donâ€™t fucking know why. Iâ€™m barely handling all the work and not finding enough time to prepare for uni admissions and iâ€™m shitting myself. Iâ€™m fucking tired all the time and I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing - literally I just do schoolwork and watch youtube videos. Iâ€™ve got no real friends I can count on, probably my fault for being a selfish cunt who canâ€™t be arsed to think about others. I donâ€™t even know what the fucking point is in trying so hard - I could still get into a good uni without all this effort and honestly I donâ€™t know if becoming a spoilt, useless loser is worth it just to go to a top uni. Sorry about that anyway, rant over.

TL/DR: Scared of failing test. Tired of work. Wondering if working towards top unis is worth having no life.
