Literally just did a rant but Iâ€™m in a mood Iâ€™m just a fucking screw-up 

I donâ€™t even know who I am 

Itâ€™s constantly getting worse and I just want to be normal but everyone is always treating me like the special kid. The stupid kid. I would literally rip my brain out if it meant getting rid of these stupid mental disorders. I donâ€™t get why people fake them or glorify or glamorize them. Like what about constantly having a practically un-fightable urge to defy everything your guardian tells you is quirky or cool? What about not being able to focus, function or even being able to control yourself is sooo quirky and cute?! What about living in constant fear of NOTHING IS CUTE?! I DONT GET IT?! People will go onto the internet and brag about these things! Like I have ODD (not OCD), adhd and anxiety and do you know what Iâ€™d do to NOT have them? I seriously want to know what goes on in peoples heads when they do this. Itâ€™s gross how people would fake a mental illness for clout or to look cool. It makes them look like idiots, and I hope they understand that what theyâ€™re doing is harmful to people who DO have mental illnesses. Like 1. Theyâ€™re giving us a bad name 2. The way theyâ€™re treating it might make some feel their condition isnâ€™t valid or that they might feel like fakers. 

Iâ€™m being edgy on the internet as a coping mechanism I know. Yes, I am looking for attention because ay man. I just want some positive attention, because all the attention I get feels like itâ€™s because Iâ€™m â€œspecialâ€ or negative energy because of my behaviour 

Iâ€™ve just been feeling horrible lately and itâ€™s only getting worse. I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Thereâ€™s so many things I want to say but I donâ€™t know how to say them. Thereâ€™s way to many things and half of them are basically impossible to put into words. I just need some encouragement please
