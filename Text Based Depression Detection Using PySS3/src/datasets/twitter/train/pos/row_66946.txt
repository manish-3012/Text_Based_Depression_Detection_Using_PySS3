I am once again here to rant about me not being smart enough It honestly feels unfixable. I just finished a science zoom call, and in the zoom the teacher was asking us to name some chemicals. She asked the smart girl to tell us what C6H12O6 is and she instantly said glucose. I have no fucking clue how the fuck she knew the fucking answer to that question. I donâ€™t think the teacher has ever told us what C6H12O6 is, an if she has then I donâ€™t fucking remember it. 

I *need* to improve my memory and overall academics. I *need* to become better than her, and I want to be recognised for that. 

I hate being called a gamer. I almost never play video games anymore, because Iâ€™ve learnt that it is better to spend time studying. People will *always* judge you on your past. If you try to hide it from them, thy will eventually find out. I donâ€™t know why I hate it, but I do. Maybe itâ€™s because I get no recognition for the effort I put in. Maybe itâ€™s because itâ€™s not true anymore.

Sometimes I honestly just feel like giving up. But I donâ€™t. I know that giving up is just a waste of our precious time on this planet. That doesnâ€™t change the fact that I feel worthless at times. Honestly all I want out of life is to be recognised for good things, and to be remembered after I die.

I guess Iâ€™m done my rant now. As always, if you have any advice then I would appreciate it a lot.
