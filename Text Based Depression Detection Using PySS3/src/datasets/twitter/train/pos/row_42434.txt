Why are y'all bitching about online school Like you're at home with sun flowing through your bedroom instead of being in a loud classroom, you have to wake up at 7 am and you have time to get prepared for the morning and 9nce you finished wirking you're at home instead of waking up on the dark at 6 am 10 minutes away from the bus and coming back home at 7p.m eating and going back to sleep for the same days everyday, people complaining about online schools are lazy fucks bitching about everything and acting all depressed saying they're lonely and deprived from any social contacts when in reality these loosers don't even try to make friends when they're given the occasion, they're also saying that they're given too much work when in they're just letting it stack and not trying to go with the flow.
