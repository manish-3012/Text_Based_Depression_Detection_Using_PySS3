I need help please! So last night my dad found my iPad, which I have been using for quite a while now to help me sleep, and he doesnâ€™t think I should have any electronics in my room. Now, I donâ€™t know what to do. I barely slept last night, but my dad wonâ€™t believe anything I tell him. He did say though, that if I can show him proof, or some sort of study showing that having electronics in your room does not affect sleep, he will give my stuff back. I know Iâ€™m asking for a lot, but truly anything helps. Iâ€™m doing research on my own as well.
