wanna talk about sealife? my favorite aquatic animal is the flamboyant cuttlefish and my favorite fish is the lake sturgeon

The Cuttlefish because 1.) cuttlefish are underrepresented among the cephalopods and 2.) the flamboyant cuttlefish is this fabulous shade of purple with yellow highlights, it is super cool

the lake sturgeon because of an experience I had at the Shedd Aquarium where the announcer was being silly "Say hello to the lake stur-geon. Hello, lake stur-geon" and it is a pretty cool fish overall.
