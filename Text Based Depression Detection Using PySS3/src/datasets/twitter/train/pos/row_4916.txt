Recommend songs related to ones I have heard I have a lot of miscellaneous songs that I really like but I don't know the exact genre or songs like them, so I will post links and you guys can listen. You can also send songs you like and I will listen (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud)

[Slovak song I like to use for learning Slovak, I need more](https://youtu.be/zYbVXO2TaSU) (idk what exact genre but I think it falls with pop music, just give me anything Slovak)

[I like the Stone Flower album and this is my favorite song from it, it's so heavenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhtzTTnt1Dw) (bossa nova I think?)

[I like the songs in this one but I love the remix aspect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0-DCn9Vao0) (future funk kinda, although what classifies future funk?)

[Sounds a bit like Jack Stauber to me, but I like the lyrics and vibe-y guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjDtCHxjb_4) (indie)

[I like how grand this is, but the weakest part for me is the moe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwpK5QJu6K4) (anime rock, not sure of the specifications)
