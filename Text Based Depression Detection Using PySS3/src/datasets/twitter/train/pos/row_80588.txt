My Cat is all the sudden sick... and Iâ€™m kind of scared. My cat of 8 to 9 years, donâ€™t remember, is all the sudden sick. It seems she was happy and playing her little heart out the night before, but today is completely different. I got her as a surprise gift from my mom after my second brain surgery, my dad wasnâ€™t aware of this gift lol, and she is the best cat in world. Iâ€™m a little biased. My parents are taking her to an emergency vet right now. Idk Iâ€™m just scared, Iâ€™ll make sure to post an update when I here any news.
