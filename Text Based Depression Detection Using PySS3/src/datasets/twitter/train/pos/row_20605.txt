A serious post on pedophilia and loli hentai. With this post i want to share and discuss my opinion (Which i recently discovered is quite controversial) that pornography such as loli hentai, that depicts minors without being actually child porn, should not be prohibited and do no damage to society. Allow me to explain.  
Pedophilia is a mental condition that, like any other sexual orientation, cannot be changed. I believe pedophiles should seek psychological help, in order to ensure they don't ever have relations with a minor, but I also believe pornography for them should exist as long as it doesn't involve real children being used. I believe this because it has been proven that countries and societies where porn consumption is common rape happens much less: It is logical that a person who is sexually frustrated will be much more propense to rape if they don't have a way of relieving sexual stress such as masturbation. The same applies with pedophiles: A pedophile who relieves sexual tension through masturbation is much less propense to ever abuse of a child than one who accumulates sexual desire with no way to relieve it.

Now, I don't understand how so many people disagree with this. It seems so clear to me that this pornography, no matter how disgusting it can be to us non-pedophiles, helps prevent actual children from being abused. That's why I make this post, to discuss this with people who think otherwise.

I am not a pedophile. Quite opposite: my life has been greatly affected by pedophilia. That is why I want it to happen as little as possible, and I believe this is a way to do so.
