is it time to have the conversation about how it's "cool" to hate anything targeted toward teenage girls? it gives misogyny. like twilight may have strange mormon undertones but all things considered it's not the worst of the bunch. and let's not even get on Taylor Swift and the amount of backlash she receives for writing about **life events**. Something about that phenomenon that everything targeted toward teenage girls is "cringe" just bleeds misogyny.
