About the post with 92 reasons not to commit suicide Okay, time for puking some negativity.

Fine, you want to help people. Super, but I don't know if this is the way to do so. You have to remember, if someone's suicidal they're probably suffering. Like, a lot. They don't care if there's stars or animals. They can't see any of it as meaningfull. Maybe they don't have any friends. For a sub with a culture based on being alone and without any friends, it seems like a lot of you are taking them for granted.

Don't get me wrong, they are good reasons for someone who is dramatic and maybe spilled some milk and now wants to die. These are not that good reasons for someone who is suffering from depression, PTSD or bipolar disorder, or any other thing that makes your life meaningless and painfull. And I know OP wanted to help, but if people who think day in and day out that everybody hates them, they can't live for the people who love them bc they don't think they exist. It's like a punch in the face to hear "Oh just live for your friends!" if you don't have any.

And by the way. The reason "People on [r/teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/teeenagers/) who care about you". Yeah no, I don't think you actually give a shit about me. I'm a username to you and nothing more. You're probably just trying to be kind to someone messed up because you want to feel good about yourself. And that's fine I guess but don't say that you care, because why would you?
