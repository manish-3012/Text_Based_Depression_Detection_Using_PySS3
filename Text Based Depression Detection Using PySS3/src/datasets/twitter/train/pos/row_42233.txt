Is it normal for my arms to be numb after pushups and dumbbell exercises? Iâ€™m a pretty weak kid, wanted to change that today, so I asked my dad if he could teach me how to build my arms. I barely managed to do 5-10 push-ups in a row, I think I only did about 17 or 21 today. I also donâ€™t know how to lift weights so it was kind of weird lifting 3lbs over my head parallel to my ears. I think doing like 20 reps or something idk what reps and sets mean. My arms are kind of numb, before and after a shower. Is it normal or something I need to worry about? Just wondering if there are such things as too much push-ups or dumbbell lifting lol Iâ€™m a beginner, arms are extremely thin compared to my legs. Do I do like 5 pushups everyday? When do I add on that?
