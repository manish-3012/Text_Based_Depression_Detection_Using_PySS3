I GOT A JOB!!! Hey, this is the first time on posting/writing something on reddit. The last months have been so stressful and stuff I'm a premed-international student in canada trying to balance studies and jobs together.
I'm not taking any courses this summer maybe one, but the thing is I was scared if i would land a job this summer and was really sad and stuff. Today I got an interview from the most posh restaurant in the city from their best location (downtown centre), they hired me as soon as I was done with the interview, i couldn't believe it
Its just I don't have a lot of people in this country that I know, just wanted to share with you guys.
Im really happy for the first time in a while

Thank you for reading this and for your time stranger.
