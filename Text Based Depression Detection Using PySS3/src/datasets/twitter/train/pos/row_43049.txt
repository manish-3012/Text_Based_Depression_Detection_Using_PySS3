where can I test for depression or bipolar disorder ive been having some serious mood swings lately with suicidal tendencies but nobody seems to take it seriously and this just worsens it
im from romania
how can I have someone diagnose me properly please help me
I have nobody irl to talk to about this and talking to people only makes me feel very lame because society looks down at people who interact in the online world so please don't meesage me if im fine or anything. It's just a little cut on the wrist. Just answer the question from the title I don't need to know anything else
