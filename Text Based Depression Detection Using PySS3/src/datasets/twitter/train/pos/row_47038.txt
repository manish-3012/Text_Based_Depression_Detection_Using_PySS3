Scared my girlfriend will feel me getting hard while kissing and think I'm a creep I've been with this girl for a couple months.

Idk if it's weird, but when we're kissing, I get hard like super quickly. 

However, she's previously told me that she's not ready to have sex until she's much older.

I'm scared that one day she'll feel that I'm hard when we're kissing or cuddling and think that I'm a creep. Or that I think we're going to have sex. Etc etc

Any advice? Girls, what would you think in this situation?

I know this is a weird question btw lol
