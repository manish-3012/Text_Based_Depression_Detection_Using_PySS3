Today I found out that my crush has a boyfriend and I need help It's 100% confirmed and I'm really fucked. 

I will save you my bitter regrets and just say that I have/had [Obsessive Love Disorder](https://www.healthline.com/health/obsessive-love-disorder). Right now I'm really suffering, I didn't sleep tonight, I want to cry (I'm actually doing it now), in school I was completely confused. I can't say how much I regret that I wasn't confession to her when she was single 3 months ago. 

I can't handle it, but I don't know what to do. I feel that I will never love any person as much as I loved her. In last months she was all my world, even she didnt know that. What to do?
