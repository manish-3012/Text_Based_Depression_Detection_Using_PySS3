Would a girl make sexual jokes with someone she's not interested in? A girl i text and i frequently joke about sexual stuff, its a part of our daily conversation. She says things like "you like me, you wanna sleep with me, you're in love with me" and vice versa. We sometimes get flirty for fun, just like to fuck around.

The other day, she was at it again repeatedly saying i know you have a crush on me and whatnot per usual, then I had to go somewhere so i was offline for 6 hours. When i came back I picked up where we left off; but what i didn't know was that she was in the middle of a huge freak-out (nothing to do with me, family business), i started to pushing the "you're into me" thing and she just agreed with everything; something she never does, so I was confused after a point and asked her if she's being serious. And with that she just blew up, started taking her anger out of me; fuming just completely going off; and since i knew nothing i was extremely confused and thought her anger was caused by what i said, so i kept asking. After i asked about it a few times she just said shut up, im not sexually attracted to you; and kept on raging.


The freak-out isn't the point, but im not sure if she meant what she said or if it was a spur of the moment thing. Would a girl make such frequent conversations with a guy she has no interest in?
