Uhh.. I think I might have a problem... Ok, I'm 13, and my wisdom teeth are coming in. oH nO. Its only the wisdom tooth spot that hurts too by the way, so I do hope I can wait until I'm like 17 to get it removed, because I think its gonna grow in and not interfere with any other teeth. Any advice lol.
