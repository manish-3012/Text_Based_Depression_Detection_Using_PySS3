unpopular opinion The process of extracting and articulating the moral of a story destroys its meaning when the moral is clear. 

For example, think back on a story that you learned as a childâ€”One that really stuck with you and helped you learn a complex ethical rule. Mine would be The Boy who Cried Wolf.  

Now try to imagine that story without the cheap imperatives built upon it. Doesnâ€™t it feel so much more powerful? 

I remember listening to the story and, soon after hearing, the teacher say, â€œSo, as we can see, the moral of the story is: Donâ€™t complain when there is nothing to complain about otherwise people will eventually not believe you.â€ 

I just remember having my reflection broken and sitting there thinking: â€œwhy did you ruin the story??â€  Her handing us the implication of the story as a scolding imperative destroyed its ability to weigh on our conscience. Rather than experiencing a profound moral revelation, we learned another fact. 


And itâ€™s not just stories about morality. 

Consider this quote

*For all it brightens, love casts long shadows*






Now let me ruin it for you... â€œThis phrase is telling us that love has the potential for just as many good things as bad things.â€ 




...Isnâ€™t that just disappointing??


Hereâ€™s another sad one: â€œFor sale: baby shoes, never worn.....â€ 



â€œWell here we can clearly see that whoever is selling those baby shoes has recently lost an expected child.â€ 




Hopefully you can see my point. 

Some things are better left unsaid, and stories should be left to the wild side of our brain.
