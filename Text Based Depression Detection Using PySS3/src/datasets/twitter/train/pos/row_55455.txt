I can finally go outside now Itâ€™s been a couple weeks and both my dad and my younger brother who both got COVID says that theyâ€™re free of symptoms. They went out and did a test and both came out negative. I can finally leave the house to get myself a Starbucks now thank god even tho Iâ€™m an introvert being cramped in a house for weeks in a row with limited video game access sucks
