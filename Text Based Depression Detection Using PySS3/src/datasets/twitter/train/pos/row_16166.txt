I'm so happy So I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend, and he has made me the happiest I've been in while. It just feels so amazing to be treated like a human being instead of a walking pocket pussy. Reason why I say this is because last time him and I hung out, things started to getting pretty wacky. But before we started doing anything ~ u n h o l y ~, I asked him if we could just stop where we were at. Here's the kicker: he respected that. He didn't beg me, make me feel guilty, or gaslight me. He simply looked at me and asked if he could at could at least just hug and kiss me. I almost cried from happiness when he said that- my body has never actually been respected in previous relationships. So this was something completely new, and I honestly can't get enough of it.
