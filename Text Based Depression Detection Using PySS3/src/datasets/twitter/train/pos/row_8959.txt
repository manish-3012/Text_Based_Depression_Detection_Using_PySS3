Im 14, anyone know some ways I can make money? Anyone know some fairly easy ways that I would be able to make some money? Iâ€™ve been invested into the vinyl hobby for almost a year now and Iâ€™m just now starting to collect more seriously but I donâ€™t have enough money to get that many records, I have an allowance of $10 per week from my parents but thatâ€™s only like one or 2 records every month. If anyone knows a job I could do where I could like $15 or $20 per week to fuel my vinyl hobby that would be great! Also my dad recently got me a Venmo account so I have that if it helps at all.
