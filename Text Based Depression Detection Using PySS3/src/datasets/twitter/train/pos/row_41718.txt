Bruh what the hell I was getting some water at 2 a.m. because I was thristy af. I took a bottle of water from the kitchen and I brought it in my bedroom to drink sum delicious night water. I opened it and it fucking exploded. It turned out that that water was fizzy water and I still don't know how the fuck it exploded. Now there's water everywhere on the floor
