It has been done. Fries forever. I havenâ€™t told you guys about my son, u/YourLocalFryDeaIer. He is now going world wide carrying  the family business. You will now answer to him if you want fresh greasy homemade fries.  It has been done. 

Statement from my son:

After all these weeks of selling fries I did it. Iâ€™m an international drug... errr fry dealer. Thank you all. With this brand new face for the company I can sell fries more then ever before.

Currently he canâ€™t deal out fries because his karma, yknow a level 1 henchman type deal. But itâ€™s gonna happen. *cue music*

Edit: canâ€™t post for 30 minutes. The day will come when he takes over the universe.
