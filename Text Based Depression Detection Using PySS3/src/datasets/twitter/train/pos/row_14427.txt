Istg mosquitoes are getting smarter. At night when I'm on my phone watching stuff and scrolling, not a single sound, but as soon as I turn it off... bzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzz, bzz, z, bzzzzz. I turn the flashlight on as soon as I can to kill the annoying little idiot and as soon as that light turns on, it flies away like nothing.
