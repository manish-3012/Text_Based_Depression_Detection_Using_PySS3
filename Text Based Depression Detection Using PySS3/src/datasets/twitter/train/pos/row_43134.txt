Canâ€™t think. Itâ€™s stopping. The same melody. Over. And over. And over.

I canâ€™t think about what I donâ€™t want to think about. It wonâ€™t let me think. Why wonâ€™t he let me think.

I know he controls it. Now would be convenient. For me not him. Which is why heâ€™s doing this.

The same melody.
