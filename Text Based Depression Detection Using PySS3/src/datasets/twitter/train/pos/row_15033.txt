My friends arenâ€™t friends Sorry for bad formatting btw. I have a decently sized â€œfriendâ€ group, and I put that in quotations because almost all the time they just talk to each other and I donâ€™t think they have ever invited me to play with them I just kinda join their games... I goto a small private school so Iâ€™ve been friends with them my whole life and they all live to far to bike/walk and Iâ€™m sick of them. However Idk what to do as all the other kids in my class who would be close to being my friends either donâ€™t have computers or are just jerks. There are two people I am actually friends with but they both hang out with my other â€œfriendsâ€ but then only get invited 25% of the time. Sorry for making someone read this I just had to write it
