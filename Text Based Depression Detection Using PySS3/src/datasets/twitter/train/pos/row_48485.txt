Why do we do Shooter drills in schools? Like if the student was the shooter, then theyâ€™d know everything that the teachers and students have planned. Like, theyâ€™d know where everybody is. Youâ€™re just helping them at that point.

Secondly, how could someone believe a bunch of kids just are randomly gone on a normal Tuesday?

Plus quarantine couldâ€™ve given somebody months to plan a school shooting, which is kind of concerning.
