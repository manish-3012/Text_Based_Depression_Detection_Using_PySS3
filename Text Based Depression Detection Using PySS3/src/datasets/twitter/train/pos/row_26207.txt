The Capital. So when I open Reddit and on the front page of all thereâ€™s r/politics showing me a news article of different people getting arrested, and Iâ€™m seeing different reports of people reporting their family members there because they took part in the riot. Now Iâ€™m seeing a report of â€œoff duty cops were at the riot at the capitalâ€ like inciting these hardworking mean and woman for simply airing their grief and their distrust against the system which I can understand. I just wish there wasnâ€™t this outright witch hunt or reporting your family or your best friends. Just this is insane, and Iâ€™m sick of it. This isnâ€™t unity, this is division, and I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if there was a full blown civil war.
