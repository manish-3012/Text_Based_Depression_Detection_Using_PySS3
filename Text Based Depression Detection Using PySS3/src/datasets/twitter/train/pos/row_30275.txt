I'm just telling you now, Trump is probably going to win. I don't support Biden or Trump, but from the way things are looking right now, Donald Trump seemingly has the upper hand when it comes to political ammunition right now. Before the George Floyd Incident, you could say that the Democrats would have a good plan to bring people to the left, but since the riots and "peaceful protests" have been destroying property and being awful portrayals of the left mentality, I'm pretty sure more people than ever are going to support Trump, because in their minds he is opposed to such behavior. Of course I could be wrong, but seeing as all this political discourse has given Trump a metaphorical Nuke in things to bash the Democrats for, I don't think it's looking to good for the Biden and the Democrats.
