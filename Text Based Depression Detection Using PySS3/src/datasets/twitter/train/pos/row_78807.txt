This may seem like an Attention Hog post but Guys Iâ€™m seriously nervous about driving, I start Drivers Ed in December and the last time I was in a Motor Vehicle It crashed. I also am not good with Precision so Parallel Parking would fail me and I just need tips and to talk to someone else who has this / had this issue
