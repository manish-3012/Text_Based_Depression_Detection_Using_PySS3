How do I help my friend? So my friends just put this in our discord:

  
Do you think your my friend cause it doesnâ€™t seem like that considering that Iâ€™ve asked you three days in a row to play a game and you canâ€™t play it but then you go and play with other people when Iâ€™m not playingï¿¼ I am shaking because of how mean 247 my friends donâ€™t hang out with me but then expect me to give them thingsï¿¼ Can I tell you the truth I donâ€™t want to live sometimes thatâ€™s how bad it feels but non of my friend care I also have a very emotional heart idk if I cry my friends should care instead of making fun of me and I want you to be my friend but I need to know when Iâ€™m sad or anything if youâ€™re going to actually care or if youâ€™re just gonna leave me aloneï¿¼

What can I say to help him? I need to do something but I have no idea what to do.
