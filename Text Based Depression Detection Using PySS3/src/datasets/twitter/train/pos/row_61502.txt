How to get motivatet? I just don't want... to eat, to sleep, to do anything...
I'm usually lazy but now it got worse in lockdown. I don't want to do anything.

 When I'm hungry I usually just grab my loaf of bread take a bite and a slice of ham and that's it. Then a sip of juice directly out of the bottle. 

I sleep in my Jeans, t-shirt and socks. I haven't been out for several days and If I am I just to grab essential things at the grocery store.

I rarely do assignments in school because I have 0% motivation. Even when I have free time I don't want to play anything or watch Netflix. My room is a total mess.

My cat died last month and now my baby Leopard gecko is ill. I don't know what to... I have so much to do but I kinda can't. And even If I manage to start I give up after maximum 30 mins.

How can I get myself to do smth productive? Or just do anything?
