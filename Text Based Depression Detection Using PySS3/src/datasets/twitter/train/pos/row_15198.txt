Got in my first car accident today We are both fine but my car is likely to be totalled after I only got it and worked on it about a month ago for 5000$ in total, The accisent was tgeir fault but I can't wait until the insurance company weasels their way into only paying half the value because "I could of avoided it" even though I had a green and she had a yield and failed to comply
