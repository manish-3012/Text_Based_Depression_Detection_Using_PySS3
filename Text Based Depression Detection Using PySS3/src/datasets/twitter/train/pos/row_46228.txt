Idea for an anime I had. The anime takes place in Poland in the early 1980s. It follow the story of two roommates. One is a writer suffering from artist's block and the other is addicted to cocaine. Both have heavy phycological issues that plague their mind, whether it be suicidal thought, uninspiration in life, crippling, sanity breaking anxiety or possibly more. They are clearly living in borderline poverty and are struggling to pay the bills as the debts soar higher and higher. The anime would very slow with minimal plot, mostly focusing on them trying to get out of debt, trying to take back their life and learning to love themselves again.

Thoughts?
