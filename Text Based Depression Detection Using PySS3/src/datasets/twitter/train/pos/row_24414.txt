Was my past relationship toxic and/or possibly abusive? I dated my ex from June-October 2020, I still have no clue if it was toxic, abusive, both or neither.

Iâ€™ll be listing some behaviors of his and please tell me what you think.

â€¢ Would â€œforgiveâ€ my mistakes, only to use them against me later and call me names.

â€¢ Body shaming me, would tell me I needed a better chest and needed to go on medicine for my weight so I could gain weight ( Iâ€™m very insecure on my weight and he knew this!) but when I made even a joke that he started heâ€™d get mad and blame me for it.

â€¢ Wouldnâ€™t listen to me when other girls would make me uncomfortable due to their flirtiness with him, wouldnâ€™t post me or really make any points to show he was with me. 

â€¢ Would force me to lose sleep due to him threatening suicide or a breakup, taking advantage of my attachment issues

â€¢ Would randomly say I was cheating on him even if I wasnâ€™t around anyone else, usually was riding my horse or at a therapy meeting.

â€¢ Left me for someone else and completely lied about it. 

â€¢ After leaving me, knowing very well he triggered my depression, self harm and starving myself, he continued to manipulate me, lead me on and message me to help him with his emotions

â€¢ Got mad at me for healing and moving on and dating someone who treats me better.

Please let me know your thoughts on what you think his behavior was towards me, and feel free to provide any advice or similar stories. Thank you so much!
