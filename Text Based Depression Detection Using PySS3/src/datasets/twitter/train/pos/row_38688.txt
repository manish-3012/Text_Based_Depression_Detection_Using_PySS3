So i made something that feels like a mistake so a month ago maybe two, i told my closest friend about how i might have and had depression for the last 5 years. Because he were the only one that could get me to stop thinking about "stuff" and i wanted to be 100% honest with him. Now it feels like everytime I'm around him he looks worried and more "down" i guess you can call it. We have known each other since second grade so that's around 8 years now. I fully understand why he'd be worried, one of his closest friends just told him that he wanted to commit suicide and have problems sleeping, eating, just getting out of bed and much more so ofcaurse he's worried. But i can't help but feel like a really bad friend for making him worry about something that he can't do anything about. I feel like i just shouldn't have mentioned it. If he wouldn't have known, maybe he would be more happy. I never meant for him to worry. People say oh if you're down talk to your parents or friends. But I can't imagine how sad my mom would be to hear that i want to end it, i just can't do that to her, you know. And after my friend's reaction i just can't help but think that, that will be a mistake i will regret till i go 6 feet under. Just wanted to share my mistake (don't know why tbh). And thanks for letting me waste your time. Have a good morning/afternoon/evening/night.
