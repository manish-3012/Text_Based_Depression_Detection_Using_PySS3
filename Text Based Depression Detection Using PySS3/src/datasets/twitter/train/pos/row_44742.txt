Just sent my crush a text! I slide up on her Snapchat story it was picture of her and after 30 minutes of contemplating it I said â€œyour so prettyâ€ is that weird I didnt wanna come across creepy lol.

Edit: she sent back â€œthank youðŸ˜â€ 

What should I say back to that lol Maybe Iâ€™m overthinking this but I need some adviceðŸ˜‚
