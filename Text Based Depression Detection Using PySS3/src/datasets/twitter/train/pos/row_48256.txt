I'm so proud of myself I used to be a proper arsehole. Like I was a racist homophobic and transphobic. And that was two years ago. I hate the person I used to be but live the person I am now. I have no idea what clicked and made me change my ways 
But I'm glad I did. I realised this cause I saw one of Steven Crowders tweets and said man what an idiot. I realised he is someone I used to watch and agree with. I'm also so sorry for the things I have said in the past that is not the person I am today.
