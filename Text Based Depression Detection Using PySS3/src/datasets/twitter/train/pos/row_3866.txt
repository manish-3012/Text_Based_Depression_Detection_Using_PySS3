I can't stop moving I have this weird thing were I run around in a circle randomly, I run back and forth hitting a wall, when I sit down I  get up randomly and run back and forth until I realize what I'm doing and I stop. This has been happening for years. I've tried to ignore it, hoping it'll stop. It's like when I daydream I have to move, does anyone else have this problem?
