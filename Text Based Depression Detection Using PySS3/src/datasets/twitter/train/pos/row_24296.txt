I actually wanna die :)) So I don't have a lot of friends. I have one to be exact. And a lot of my family say "oh that's not true! You talk to so-and-so during school, blah blah blah." And I do, but those are people who I HAVE to talk to. Yeah we talk during school and whatnot, but they don't actually wanna hang out with me. I only have one person who actually DOES wanna be my friend. Who matches the same amount of energy I put out and who doesn't have any friends either.

We've been friends for years and been by each other's side for so long. And I'm actually so dramatic by saying that she's only moving, but it hurts. So fucking much. She's the only person who actually WANTS to hang out with me. Who WANTS to be friends with me. We've made so many plans for the future, but they seem like dust now. 

I hate how over dramatic I am about this, but I love her. So much. And I know that's GÃ†, but oH wELl. One's always gotta catch feelings, amirite? 

But holy shit, I'm actually broken. She was my light. She made me smile when I couldn't. She was fucking there for me. And she's leaving. I don't know what to do or feel or just.. I'm actually broken.
