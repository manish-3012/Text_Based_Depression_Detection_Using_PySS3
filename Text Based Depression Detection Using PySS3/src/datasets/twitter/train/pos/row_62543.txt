Should I take the job? I really need advice So I need a job to earn some extra cash before I go to college. Thereâ€™s a job opening for being a server at a sushi restaurant. I want to take it, but the sushi chef there likes me. I donâ€™t like him like that back. I only consider him as a friend. I donâ€™t want it to be awkward. Should I take the job?
