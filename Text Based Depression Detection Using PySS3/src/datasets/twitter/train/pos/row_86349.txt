School situation I need to take and finish an English course in 4 weeks which means each week constantly writing or reading for 4 hours in one classroom(since itâ€™s not for one semester just 4 weeks they made each class 240 minutes long), reading The Great Gatsby within 3 days then doing an assignment then King Lear then a summative(last assignment) and done the class. Anyone got a similar situation like this? For me itâ€™s about 15 classes a week for one subjects. Also half online and half in school
