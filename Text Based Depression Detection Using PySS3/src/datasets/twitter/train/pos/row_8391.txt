Weâ€™ve fucked up Wall Street, now letâ€™s fuck up nestlÃ© Nestle has been one of the shittiest and most corrupt companies in existence. They constantly violate human rights laws and donâ€™t give a shit about it. The point of this post is to tell everyone to JOIN TOGETHER AND STOP NESTLÃ‰ (GameStops situation proved this sort of thing is possible). I donâ€™t have many ideas, but we can start by buying as little nestle products as possible. Please spread this idea. And if you have any other ideas/comments, please share them with me. Iâ€™ll try to be open minded and listen to everything. Letâ€™s continue our streak of ruining shitty companies!

â€œApes, stronk, together!â€
