i found out how to skip at my school without getting in trouble So in online school my teachers only take attendance for the first class which for me is Latin.

and I recently found out from the juniors at my school that I only have to go to four of the six classes.

So I Attend latin math literature and science and skip spanish and history  and the teachers cant get me in trouble. 

but I can only skip the class if I dont have an important test.
