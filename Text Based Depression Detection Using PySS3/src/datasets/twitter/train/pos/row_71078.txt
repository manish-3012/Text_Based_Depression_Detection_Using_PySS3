A little bit annoyed. Sometimes, theses kids who are a couple of years older than me call me btec Casey when I pass by them for no reason and I didn't know what that meant but I always shouted fuck you to them since Casey wasn't even my name and that they were pissing me off.

Anyway, I got curious and typed btec on urban dictionary and I was kind of pissed when I realised what it meant.

Next time I hear the say that to me, I think I might slap them since I don't know who Casey is, who they are or why the hell they thought it would be funny to say that. 

They are at least 2 years older than me and the did it since year 7 and now almost everyone who is a year or more older than me calls me btec Casey and it annoys me since all I want is for people to call me by my real name since not many people before secondary school knew I even existed so it would be nice now that at least 100 people know if my existence for them to call me by my name.

TLDR: A couple of bitches call me btec Casey. Found out what it meant and got pissed and now everyone calls me Btec Casey.

Btw, My name is actually Kiera which doesn't sound anything like Casey.

Sorry for writing this, just wanted to write about this to somebody.
