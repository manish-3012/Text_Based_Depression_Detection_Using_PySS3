Advice from a former teenager Advice from a former teenager:
 
I am turning 20 very very soon, so I wanted to do a formal writeup of some advice I wish I would have heard throughout my teenage years. 

**Being a teenager doesnâ€™t last forever.** 

Youâ€™re only a teenager for 7 years. Cherish these years, it only happens once. When I joined Reddit 5 years ago, turning 20 seemed like forever away. Now it is happening. 

 
**Take as many photos and videos as you can** 

Everyone has a camera in their pocket nowadays â€“ their phone. Use it. I had many friends â€“ including one that sadly passed away â€“ that I never got pictures with. So many memories I never even took a little video of. I wish I could go back earlier and tell myself to just get one picture of those times. 



**Go the fuck outside** 

I know some of yâ€™all reading this sit inside all day playing video games. Trust me I used to be the same way. But please go outside and do something. Thereâ€™s so many amazing people and adventures waiting for you in the world. I missed out on making any friends in middle school because I thought playing Minecraft was more important. I ended up digging myself further into social anxiety and depression because I was unknowingly avoiding the real world. 


**If you have any interest in something, try and pursue it** 

Youâ€™re young, you have way more time to pursue and improve on any hobby. Once you go to college, you have soooo many more responsibilities and stresses than in high school. I just started to skateboard, but sadly I only have time to go to the skate park a couple hours a week. 

 

There was this elective class (photo journalism) that I randomly decided to try my sophomore year because a friend told me about it. I ended up finding a big passion of mine (photography and design) through this class, and now I am going to college for that. Try as many things as you can. Even if it fails, you at least know you donâ€™t like it. For instance, I tried many business classes. I ended up hating accounting, and this let me know that I definitely shouldnâ€™t do anything related to that in college. 


**Take classes that actually matter** 

Donâ€™t worry about taking honors or AP classes. Honestly. Find stuff that you are truly interested in and take classes in that. You will learn so much about yourself and your interests. 



Also, life is the greatest teacher. Iâ€™ve learned way more from being with friends, exploring the world, meeting people, and working a part time job than Iâ€™ve ever learned in school. 

 

College is easier to get into than you think. Just try to have at least a 3.0 and one extracurricular activity and youâ€™re set. Just do your homework and put in a little effort in class and youâ€™ll do this easily. 

**Conclusion**

Basically I typed all of this pretty hastily, so ignore how rushed it is (there's many other similar posts with good advice also). A lesson you can get from all of this is "live your teenage years to the fullest". Go out there and make friends. Explore the world. Every person has so much potential. My teenage years have had the darkest and most amazing times of my life, but I am still here and more experienced than ever.

Also, dating is fun and dope af, but you'll look back one day at all those failed dates and relationships and realize that a lot of them weren't as important as you thought in the grand scheme of things. So just do whatever makes **YOU** happy.
