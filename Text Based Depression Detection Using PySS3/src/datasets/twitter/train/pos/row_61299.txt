The problem with boomers. Hey dad, could you just give me some respect and space? Just handle the fact I'm going to be a bit distant. And yes, I play video games on the console you bought me. Crazy I know. Just don't fucking scold me everytime I play. Also if I play for 1hour and do something else and you DONT see me, It doesn't mean I'm still playing. And 2 hours â‰  4 hours.
