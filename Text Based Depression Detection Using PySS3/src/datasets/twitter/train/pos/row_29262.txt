Getting a girlfriend will not help your personal problems A lot of people here seem to think that if they get a girls, all their problems will go away. When in reality, it'll just show them how bad they really are. If you date someone, you'll just pass your burdens onto whoever is with you. You have to work on yourself before someone else will be good for you fam. I'm not saying this is the case for everyone, but a lot of people need to hear this.
