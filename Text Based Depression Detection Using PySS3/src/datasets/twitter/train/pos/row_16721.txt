I just got an ad for an black reboot of Peter Pan and Alice in wonderland And what the fuck? I mean honestly. If you want to tell cool stories about black people, make new ones, donâ€™t rewrite white people stories. We do that enough ourselves. It makes no sense to do this. Just make new stories. Itâ€™s so fucking stupid and I donâ€™t understand why people think constant reboots is a good idea 

Also Iâ€™m pretty sure the guy who played Alfred in The Dark Knight trilogy is in it so thatâ€™s like the one good thing.
