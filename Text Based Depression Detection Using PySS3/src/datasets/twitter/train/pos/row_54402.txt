Iâ€™m at a place Iâ€™m proud of Sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place for this, but idk where else to put it. For years Iâ€™ve been neglecting my physical health, and Iâ€™ve always been super skinny. If i ate a ton it would go straight to my gut and Iâ€™d be super skinny with a giant belly. I started working out about 4 months ago and Iâ€™m actually at a spot with my body Iâ€™m proud of. Nobodyâ€™s really noticed or said anything, but just the feeling of being able to confidently walk around is so much more than enough to make me happy. I just thought Iâ€™d share and tell anyone thatâ€™s in the same boat I was, itâ€™s totally possible!! Donâ€™t let anything anyone says drag you down, and put your mind to it and it will get done!
