How do I forget someone who meant a lot to me though I know didnâ€™t treat me right that I havenâ€™t talked to for about a year? Thereâ€™s this guy i was close to and some songs remind me of him.

The songs end up getting me a bit emotional and in occurrence I cry since a lot of our memories replay.

It didnâ€™t really end up in good terms since I ended up cutting him out of my life, realizing how he didnâ€™t treat me that right as I thought he did and I was obsessed with him since I really liked him.

Itâ€™s like I wish things did end up in good terms, though I wish I was treated and taken more seriously besides ignoring at that time he had a big ego. 

I remember showing this song too him which was called â€œtoo good at goodbyesâ€ and I played it too before he left which left me really emotional.

 Now I canâ€™t listen to that song since it kind of hurts but not as much as it did before to listen to it.

Is there truly anyway to fully move on?
