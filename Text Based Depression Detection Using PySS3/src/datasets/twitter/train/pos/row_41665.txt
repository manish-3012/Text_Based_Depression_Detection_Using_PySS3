Clarification for my last post No Iâ€™m not homophobic what I was trying to say is that if someone is gay and they are being toxic about it mentioning that youâ€™re gay every two seconds than itâ€™s your fault if someone is homophobic towards you, now if youâ€™re gay and you are just minding your own business and someone is bothering you than yeah thatâ€™s wrong, sorry for my last post I didnâ€™t worded correctly and it seemed like I was being homophobic hope this makes sense
