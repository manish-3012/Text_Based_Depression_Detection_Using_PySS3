So my parents texted me this morning and said I'm in huge trouble when they come back from their business trip because this girls parents found out she was at my party and told my parents, and I wasn't supposed to be having people over My older brother did the same exact shit and they aren't even mad at him they're just blaming it all on me it's not fair idk what to do. He always gets away with everything he does. I'm probably gonna lose my car keys and my pc for a long time it's so irritating
