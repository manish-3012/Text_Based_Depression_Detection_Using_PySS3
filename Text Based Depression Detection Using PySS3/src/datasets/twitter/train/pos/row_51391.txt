Light probably wouldâ€™ve gotten away with being Kira in Death Note if... In the beginning he never revealed to authorities that he was in Japan by taunting them killing more people in Japan. I could be wrong tho but thatâ€™s just what I think. Iâ€™ve only seen the series about two times so thereâ€™s a lot I donâ€™t remember/didnâ€™t consider
