Boys/bros, have ever gotten a compliment from a girl? Just kinda asking. As im ln bed rn i just remembered one time when i was in thailand and this shopworker girl was "giving clear signals" or whatever you call those and i didnt know till my mom told me about that girl week after in home, damn i felt good after hearing that.
