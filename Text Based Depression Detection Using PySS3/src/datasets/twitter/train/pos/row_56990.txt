This ever happen to yâ€™allðŸ¤” Iâ€™m literally so lonely and have so little social interactions now that I literally fell in love with a fucking video game character because sheâ€™s always so happy to see me and I havenâ€™t felt that in awhile , sheâ€™s cute, and I see her a lot because sheâ€™s an important character. Iâ€™m not sure what yâ€™all want to do with this information but I thought Iâ€™d share it.
