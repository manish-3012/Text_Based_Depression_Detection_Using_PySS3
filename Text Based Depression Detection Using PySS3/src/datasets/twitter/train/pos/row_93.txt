17 years ago today, cries started to flood a single ward deep in the depths of a hospital. A legend came into this world. That legend is me. Yes I'm brave enough to admit that I am awesome and love myself entirely. I've eaten healthy and excercised vigorously throughout this hell of a year, not to forget brushing up my academics. I've also saved up for a new pair of socks. I'm so proud of myself. Can any of you rich redditors give me an award of any kind, please? The cheapest will even do because that would make my entire day infinitely more exciting! 

Award givers will be highly commended through dm's.
