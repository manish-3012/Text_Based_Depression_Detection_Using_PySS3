Hey there. Is there anything I can do while I'm lonely? Everyday I'm lonely and I can't go outside because of Corona and I'm an introvert. I don't have friends in school but the only friend I do have is a plush pig, I got it when I was 5. I always have a serious face or sad face on me and haven't smiled in a while. Is there anything I can do while I'm lonely?
