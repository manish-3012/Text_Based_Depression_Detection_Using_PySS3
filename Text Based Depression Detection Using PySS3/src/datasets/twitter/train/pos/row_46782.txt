How do y'all stay motivated? Hey y'all

I've just got a quick question to ask you guys: how do you stay motivated to do things?   


As of writing this, in every single subject I'm in, I have a test tomorrow for. But I can't find the will power to study or do anything. I believe if I keep this up, I'll never climb out of this depressing hole of 1,000 word essays and quadratic equations without studying. But I just can't find the ability to do so. So how do you do it? How do you keep at it without failing?
