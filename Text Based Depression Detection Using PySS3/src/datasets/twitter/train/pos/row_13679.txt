Lifes really weird right about now I think I like this person at school, like a crush and I know I'll fail. Then there is someone in my life I hate to their soul. I have seen that I get more angry recently. I'm switching my career choice more than I do with my food choices. I'm turning into a soldier main. I've spent 50$ on tf2. And I got 2 weeks off of school.
