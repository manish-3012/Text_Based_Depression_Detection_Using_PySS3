Any teaching advice? r/teenagers probably isn't the best place to ask for serious advice but to be completely honest, I want to start posting here. I'm apparently a tennis coach and I 'd like some advice on how to be a good enjoyable coach that is not a cunt or a pain to be with. Does anyone have anything?
