My Journey for Pog Dogs (Minecraft) So I joined an MC server. I found a nice place to build. 3 pog dogs. I gave them collars and everything. It was only my first day (yesterday). I claimed a spot of land at a village to store stuff until I built my base nearby. The dogs, bed, and valuables were stored underground. I forgot to sleep and died, teleported 30000 blocks away. I was so sad. All hope was lost, I thought there was no way to get back. I found a desert village and two pog cats. 

Then, a miracle happened. I was told that I could find the coords of the village near my dogs and take my cats too. I tpped to spawn with my cats which got us halfway. Weâ€™ll see if we get there today, itâ€™ll be hard but I will do anything for my pog dogs and pog cats. Iâ€™ll be posting daily updates.
