Society is brainwashed and blinded to accept the genital mutilation of babies. Genital mutilation is legal in every single country in this world. Also known as the â€˜circumcisionâ€™ of baby boys. We condemn the circumcision of baby girls and call it FGM whereas we blatantly accept it for boys in the 21st century.

Humans rights havenâ€™t even been established for men, women were given the right to vote and fgm was banned decades ago yet boys are being opening genitally mutilated.

Reasons:
1) circumcision is a barbaric and cruel procedure, to cut and pierce through a babyâ€™s natural genitals with knives and scissors crosses the limits of humanity/ethics.

2) circumcision is an absolute violation of human rights and a violation of the babyâ€™s body. They arenâ€™t consenting to this cruel surgery which permanently alters their body for life. We talk about consent with abortion and sex, im pretty sure cutting genitals also violates their choice

3) the foreskin is a natural and fully functional part of the penis. It contains blood vessels, nerve endings and sensory neurones, circumcision decreases sensitivity and destroys the natural function of the penis. The foreskin also acts as a natural lubricant and protective layer, in fact women have an equivalent foreskin- the clitoris hood, however we considering cutting the female foreskin FGM while the male foreskin circumcision when both are genital mutilation.

These are some main points.
