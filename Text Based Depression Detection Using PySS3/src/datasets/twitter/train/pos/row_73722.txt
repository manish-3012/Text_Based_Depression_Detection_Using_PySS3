ATTENTION BOYS Okay so I just want to say this i saw a post saying that you should ask a girl questions (if you like her or on a date or just want to be friends) THAT IS NOT THE BEST THING TO DO yes you should ask her questions but at the same time talk about you're self but dont seem pushy dont only talk about you're self and dont seem full of you're self or narcissistic cause let me just say this NO ONE LIKES IT WHEN ANYONE IS NARCISSISTIC just let that be clear and thats all i had to say and good luck
