Yooo I think I'm gonna like... quit reddit and discord Imma keep Youtube for exercise videos ig, but after encountering a really obssessive person who only lived online and made multiple alts to harass me I realised I don't want to be like that. They were a similar age to me and now I see that my screentime is way to big for my own good, I don't want to end up like them. Any tips or anything would be appreciated!
