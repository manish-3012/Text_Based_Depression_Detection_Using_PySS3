how do you guys survive distance learning  our school had been doing pretty well this year, everyone had actually been studying in person since September. but the coronavirus cases in my country are skyrocketing so we're in quarantine now, again.
didn't think it would be this bad. i haven't been doing well in school anyway lately, but now that it's online i can't concentrate at all, i don't understand anything and i want to sleep. i want time to stop, but i can't and I'm only getting bombarded with more and more assignments.

i know most of you haven't been to school in person ever since the beginning of the pandemic, so this whole post might sound ridiculous, but how are you holding up? how the fuck are you still alive? how do I stay alive?

please i need help lol
