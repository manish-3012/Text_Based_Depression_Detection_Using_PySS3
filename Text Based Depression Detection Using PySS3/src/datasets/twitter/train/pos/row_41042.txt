You like eating balls donâ€™t you? So I was eating dinner with my family. For context, we where eating meatballs in tomato sauce and my grandmother randomly says: GDpuro, You like eating balls donâ€™t you? Not clarifying that she meant meatballs, so now my mom and sister are teasing me.
TLDR. My grandmother says that I like to eat balls. My sister and mother are teasing me about it.
