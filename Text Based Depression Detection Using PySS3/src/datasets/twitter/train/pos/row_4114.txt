9-year-old me got 16-year-old me a nude Sounds ridiculous, right? Itâ€™s not time travel. When I was 9, I was a little bastard with impulse control issues. My psychiatrist suggests to my mom that I try karate because it will help me connect my mind to my body and also learn to let off steam in a way that doesnâ€™t hurt other people. In karate, I met a kid. Weâ€™ll call him Harry. Harry and I go to different schools now but weâ€™ll end up going to the same high school. We end up becoming pretty good friends. Fast-forward to freshman year, I get kicked out of my old friend group for various stupid reasons. Harry says to me something like â€œhey, why donâ€™t I introduce you to my friendsâ€ and Iâ€™m like â€œok.â€ So I meet his friends, meet their friends, and I become good friends with one of them. Fast forward to a few nights ago, they suggest that we sext. Iâ€™m like â€œalrightâ€ and they send me a nude. So, uh, wacky.
