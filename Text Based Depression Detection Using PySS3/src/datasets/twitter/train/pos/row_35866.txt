as someone turning 18 this year, i donâ€™t care if itâ€™s legal, people around 25 who date 18 year olds are gross thereâ€™s not going to be some magical maturity switch that flips in my head when i turn 18.

why would someone whoâ€™s graduated college 3 years ago want to date someone who is just out of high school or possibly still in high school, instead of someone their age? 

they wouldnâ€™t have anything in common. theyâ€™re just being a predator.
