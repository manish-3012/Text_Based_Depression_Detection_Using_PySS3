trigger warning: suicide lol the past 2 days i have wanted to fucking end it so bad, but iâ€™m too weak to actually do it, i havenâ€™t even gotten out of bed once today. all day iâ€™ve been listening to Adams Song by blink-182 trying to find either a will to live, or the bravery to actually kill myself, and atm iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s the second option lol
