i have a boyfriend, now what? I thought I never get a significant other and be single for my life and now that I am someone's boyfriend I don't know what to do. what do I do with him? poke him with a stick?  I am new to this whole dating thing I mean obviously I could take him on a date. I think what I should do is do what my heart says (with approval from my nonexistent brain.)  I have always imagined as dating someone as friendship &amp; romance intertwined.

I should probably mention I am pan and trans so this is a gay thing going on here
