Unpopular opinion: Sphinx cats are fucking adorable and people need to stop being so mean to them Whenever i mention Sphinx cats i hear people say shit about wanting to kill one because its so fucking ugly or wanting to kick it. 

But due to their lack of hair they act like dogs and show affection constantly. 

They have adorable eyes and skin that feels like peaches
