I will die in 6 and a half hours (figuratively) Firstly I have to explain something. In Poland what you finish your primary school that you attend since you're 6 you can either go and look for a job (that's a bad idea) or go to high school. There are two types of high school
1) where you get rather general knowledge and study something specific like psychology or geography. After you finish it you usually go to uni. And it lasts for 4 years. 
2) where you get general knowledge too but as you go on certain subjects that are not as important like history or chemistry are dropped. After you graduate you can go straight to work in your field. There are also job related subjects where you need to have 50% to even pass (normally it's like 30%). It lasts 5 years. 
So I'm attending the second type of high school and my first class today is one of these special classes and since I can barely sleep and I'm not the brightest person  out there I'm very stressed out about it and my stress fuels my insomnia. So yeah it's not a pog-bog moment

Ps. 
Some of you might think that it's fine to just not listen to one class but no, it's not. That first lesson is website development and theoretically every lesson should be packed with info. Only times that they are not are when our teacher is generous and just tells us to review our notes or something like that and since we're just leaving winter break she won't be
