I lose motivation for school online Hi, so lately I haven't been motivated at all in school and just been half-assing all my assignments. I barely study for quizzes, try-hard on assignments and extra-curriculars just seem pointless now. My GPA is also dropping at an alarming rate which is very bad so anyone else feel this way too? Also, if everybody could share tips or advice on how to actually do well in the online world that would also be much appreciated.
