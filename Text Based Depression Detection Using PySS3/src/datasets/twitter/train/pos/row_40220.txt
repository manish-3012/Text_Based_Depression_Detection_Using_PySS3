If you're into trains, try Train Sim World 2 I'm obviously not a developer. But I absolutely LOVE this game. It's the best Train Simulator on the market. It doesn't get more in depth than this when it comes to Train Simulators.

The braking feels amazing. The accelerating feels amazing. The graphics are amazing. The physics are amazing.

They also regularly release new routes and trains. (as DLC's)

They also regularly do streams on YouTube about what's to come and stuff.

Dovetail Games has my respect for making such an amazing game. And there's tons more to come.

If you're into trains like me, you can't go wrong with this.
