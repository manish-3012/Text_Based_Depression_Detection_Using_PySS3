jeez i feel like i'm in some basic American coming of age movie. I'm literally sitting in my bed watching nick at night (icarly specifically) while doing homework and complaining abt how stressed I am. Minus well have me playing some Friday by Rebecca black and sing into my hairbrush while dancing around my room.
