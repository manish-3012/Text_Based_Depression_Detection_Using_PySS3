I know this is long overdue but I need to say it I know everyone has been talking about the movie cuties and stuff and yeah it's been a little annoying but have you read the plot for the thing, it's about a Muslim girl getting interested in a twerking dance group in case you didn't know.

This really bothers me and my Muslim friends and shit and I can't believe that they would make a movie like that, like what the heck man, do you see movies similar to this but with a Jewish girl, or maybe a Christian girl instead. I can't stand to see this and it hurts me and the Muslims in my community, idk why I even need to say this. I'm 14 year old guy, and yet Im the only person that is gonna talk about this, I think. The way that sociaty is becoming disgusts me more and more. I truly don't understand why they had to make a movie about this, and the fact Netflix redid the cover to make it worse. I can't believe this shit.
