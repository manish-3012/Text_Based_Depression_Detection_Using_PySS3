Parents and money I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just my parents but every time I get or earn money my parents want me to spend it on stupid shit. Like Iâ€™ll get birthday money then a few days later Iâ€™ll ask my mom to get more shampoo because Iâ€™m running out and sheâ€™ll say â€œwhy do you get your own shampoo since your so rich nowâ€. Ugg itâ€™s so frustrating.
