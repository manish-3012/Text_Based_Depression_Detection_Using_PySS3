This is definitely the worst place to ask, but... So this girl i'm talking to seems like she's into me, we're each others #1 best friends on snapchat now, and I just slid into her dms and we facetimed the other day. Now the thing is, she doesn't respond very quickly. At all. I'll send her a snap, and she'll respond after 3 hours, then I'll open it and respond in 10 minutes. I have a genuine addiction to snapchat, so I can't leave it for 3 hours, and besides I'd feel really bad. If a girl would like to explain what's going on here, and why she takes so long to respond, that would be greatly appreciated...
