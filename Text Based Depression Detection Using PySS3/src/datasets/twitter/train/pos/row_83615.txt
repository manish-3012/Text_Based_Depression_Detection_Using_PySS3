How do I open up I donâ€™t know what to put for the flair. Anyways, any tips on how to open up? Iâ€™ve never truly attempted to open up ever, to anyone, not even my family. I never let anything slip, I donâ€™t even have to try, I just automatically say what I think a normal person would say. Whenever I get scolded by my mom or something sad happens to someone I know I donâ€™t feel sad and whenever someone does something for me or something happens to me that should make me happy I donâ€™t feel either, I think. On the rare occasion that I feel something, usually something sad, I just rant to myself in my head. My internal rants are usually just me questioning myself and answering myself. When I rant I think the same way I usually do Iâ€™m kind of stuck thinking from afar, I donâ€™t know how to explain this but emotion doesnâ€™t affect my thoughts. I know that contradicts what I said before but I do not know how to phrase it. Even now Iâ€™m struggling to write this because I have never done anything like this before. Iâ€™m writing this like how I would a letter, mainly to keep myself typing. If I attempt to actually say my thoughts I donâ€™t think it would make sense to anyone but me and I probably couldnâ€™t type fast enough or keep so many words in my head at once to do it anyways. And now Iâ€™m losing myself to my thoughts so Iâ€™m going to post this
