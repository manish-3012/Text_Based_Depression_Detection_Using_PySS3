When I was like 7 I got a black eye Heres the fun part: I got it running headfirst into a pole like a complete dumbass.

Other dumbass injuries include:

Slamming my finger in a car door (I still don't grip my fingers around doors)

Dislocating my kneecap at 2 am by tripping

Rubbing my forehead on the carpet untill it bled, then kept doing it "since it itches"

Hand on stove (twice)

Jumped off couch and bit my tongue

Honorable mention: the time my brother got in his friends cars trunk and had the door slammed on his head. (Pretty sure that was a concussion).
