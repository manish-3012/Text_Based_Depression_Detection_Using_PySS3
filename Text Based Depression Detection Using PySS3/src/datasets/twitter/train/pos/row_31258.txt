Santa animatronic that breathes? So me, my dad, and my brother were at CVS one day to pick up something. I went over to their Christmas section to look at the stuff that just came in, and I found this little Santa dancing animatronic with a saxophone. I pressed the try me button on the Santa, and it started to dance and sway while â€œplayingâ€ the saxophone. The song was good, it was a Christmas song that came out in the 90â€™s. But once it stopped, i noticed how it actually was really creepy. The eyes for one were just black circles with tiny white dots in the middle. The swaying of its movement was not creepy, but at times during its little performance it would inflate and deflate its cheeks like it was taking a breath, which looked creepy more than silly. I thought nothing about that and decided to get it, but when I pressed the button again, nothing happened. I pressed it another time and it started. Literally. BREATHING. If people think Iâ€™m talking about the cheeks thing, this was different. Itâ€™s whole body was moving so eerily like a humanâ€™s! It would continue to breathe for another couple of minutes, even if you pushed the try me button again. At this point I was not feeling so good about buying this, as the hairs on my back were standing up,  which for me only happens when I am truly creeped out, and my body knows something is up. I later decided to put it back in its place because I  felt like  the eyes had started to watch me. This might sound ridiculous, but the other ones near it had no breathing, and only played itâ€™s song. I know the breathing isnâ€™t a malfunction because it plays if you press the try me button for different amounts each time.
