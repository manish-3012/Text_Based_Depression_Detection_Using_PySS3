rant abt depressing shit its good to rant and get this off my chest, probably gonna delete in like 5 mins. so this one time, i had my first panic attack, and the shit lasted for like 2 hours, and 3 days on going high anxiety. I pulled an all nighter studying for the fucking SAT, and then the next day panic attack strikes boom. then i fucking couldn't sleep for THREE DAYS. I called the fucking ambulence cause i thought i was having something health relate but shit it was anxiety. I hate my life. Why the fuck is shit so tiring all the fucking time. but ppl have it worse, idk, but that doesn't undermine my feelings if i'm genuinely feeling bad. i rlly dont know why im posting this, just wanna be doing smth. forcing my self-centered melodrama bs on internet-strangers-possible-pedophiles is gratifying so here we go
