I wanna open commissions because I wanna work but I'm terrified of covid so I can't work outside and I can't think of anything I can do from home besides drawing but my art is ass, I take forever to draw 1 thing and I have a tiny following and idek why people would choose /me/ out of all the better artists but people are telling me to go for it when I don't even know how commissioning works and AAAAAAAAA 

sorry for the run-on sentence
