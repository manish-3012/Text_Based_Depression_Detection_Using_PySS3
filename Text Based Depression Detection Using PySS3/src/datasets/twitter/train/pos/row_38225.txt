A rant on the US electoral college So people argue that counting everyone votes would mean states like New York and California would control the votes. When for one they don't even make up half the size of country and two the electoral college is worst. Since California has a bigger number of people it has more elector votes makes sense. But if more people vote for one side in the electoral college than all the votes go to that side. So big states have more control than if they counted all votes individually. This is the stupidest system I've heard of it should be split not all. Why did the founding fathers think this is a good system is beyond me, but it makes them seem like a bunch of idiots.
