I kinda got a sleep problem.. [First, this is serious post, I have not marked it as serious as the jokes that people comment in some posts cheer me up]

Ight, i don't really have anything to say as an intro so ima jump straight to the point;

It's been nearly two weeks that sleep just doesn't come as easily as it used to, and recently (since about two days ago) I've started jumping from asleep to awake for no known reason..I'm tired, tired as i really want a good sleep and tired of this odd routine in general.. I miss when i had random nice dreams,, now I can't even dream properly anymore without waking up at random times! 

Is this normal? Am i overthinking?
