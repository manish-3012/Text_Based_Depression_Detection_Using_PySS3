I don't know why, but I feel like blocking a girl I met online and I need your help. So I got to know a girl (15F) and now I feel like she except too much from me.

First,  I didn't want a relationshi (she didn't either),  she was just nice to talk to. We talked and called on discord, later I got her snap etc. It has been a couple of months now and lately I feel like shit. Just because I know that one time things will end and I won't text her anymore. 

Why would I leave her? 
I never met het irl, but know what she looks like. Don't get me wrong shr is probably one of the nicest, if not ne nicest girl I have ever talked to. I sometimes don't wanna talk. I think that I don't deserve her. She should go and talk to people who are closer to her, not a stranger she met online. 

I can't just block her, because she will be broken and I would be a dick. Another mistake was asking for a picture of her or just her snap.  It's something you should never share with a random, it doesn't matter how long you talk to him. Maybe I am overreacting and being a little bitch.
