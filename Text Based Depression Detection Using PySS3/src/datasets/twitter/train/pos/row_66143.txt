My cat needs help and I cant help him )))))))): His leg is either swollen very bad or broken. He will not use it and he hisses and growls if you go near it. He also has a deepish cut on his nose. My mom is at work and there is nothing I can do ): My poor little buddy is in so much pain and I can't do anything to help. I am not going to get any sleep tonight bc I feel so shitty. Is there anything I can do for the pain? There also is no observable cuts or bruising on his leg it just looks swollen and possibly broken.
