Remember to play with your pets. You ever feel terribly bored when your internet goes down and thereâ€™s nothing to do?

Chances are thatâ€™s how your pet has felt for most of their lives. Please play with them for at least an hour a day. It doesnâ€™t have to be all at once, it could be like 10 minutes every few hours. It would mean a lot to them.

Also if you have a dog please walk them. Itâ€™s good for both of you, and dogs get unhappy being stuck at the house all day.
