Iâ€™m sick of it Stop saying neither when asked who you support during the election. Sure Joe Biden isnâ€™t exactly my first choice but â€œneitherâ€ clearly isnâ€™t a fucking choice anymore, this is legitimately life or death. Iâ€™m so goddamn sick of people playing that card, we donâ€™t have the time for indecision right now. If you are able to, ***please vote***, for the sake of our future.
