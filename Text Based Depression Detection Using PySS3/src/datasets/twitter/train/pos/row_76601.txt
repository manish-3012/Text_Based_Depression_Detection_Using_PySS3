Iâ€™ve honestly been considering going vegan This is just a personal post, not trying to convince anyone to go vegan lol


I just donâ€™t see why not. I always was so scared about just never eating animal products, but now that I think about it, Iâ€™m really not picky at all. And there are things made to taste like animal products, so who even cares. Iâ€™d likely just try my best to not eat animal products on my own though. If my mom makes chicken for supper, I canâ€™t say no because sheâ€™d probably get upset lol
