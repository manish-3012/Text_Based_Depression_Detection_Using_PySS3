Should I end it? I can't do that anymore! I have been feeling like shit the past few years. Everyone says I'm just faking depression and I'm not really depressed. "Gen Z is all fake depression therefore you also do!". I am ao close ending it all. Tell me a good reason not killing myself. I don't care about the feelings of my family.
