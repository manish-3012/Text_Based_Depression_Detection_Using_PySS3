As an young teen what is something you wanted to do, but glad you never did? I remember when I was 13 I had a crush on this girl lets call her X who I had sketching class with. 

I used to play football(European) at that time and overheard some older boys talking among themselves how girls like it when boys are direct and rough. 

So I had this idea that I would go and kiss X no consent after the class. So on the next day I came and sat behind her desk. We got some kind of statuette to sketch that day. It was as usual normal class and got over after half an hour. So in order get X alone I told her to stay I have something to say in personal. After the whole class went out I was ready to kiss her. But suddenly I was struck by this sudden fear in my heart. It was screaming in my conscience that I would regret this. 
I just told her that I really liked her sketch. In return she said thanks and went away giving me a weird smile.

Four years later, she is in my biology class. She talked to me said that she knew I had crush on her in middle school. We became preety good friends until this lockdown ruined it. 

We are well connected in social media and used to talk to each other almost everyday. Yesterday I asked her out for date and she said yes. 

Wish me luck for taday boissss.
