My first sleep paralysis demon... So a few weeks ago I was having a hard time sleeping, then I started feeling weird. I was particularly asleep then I got all stiff. I froze and felt my hand moving up to my neck, I looked around and saw my sleep paralysis demon looking at me. Dark long blurry face and whispering some weird things into my ears. I started freaking out and tried to stop my hand from going up to my neck, I started arguing back with the demon in my head. Suddenly I snapped out of it and that sleep paralysis demon was just my Honeywell Quite Set I keep next to me while I sleep.
