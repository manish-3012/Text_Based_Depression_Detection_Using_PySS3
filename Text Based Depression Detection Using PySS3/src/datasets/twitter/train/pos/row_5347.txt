If you stop being friends with someone because of their political views, you weren't their friend to begin with. Just because your friend said that he/she doesn't think Trump/Bernie/AOC or anyone else is as bad as you personally think, doesn't mean you should cut off all contact with them forever. That's just not being a true friend.

Now if the person turns out to be a "Trump is God and is the greatest president ever" type of person then I could see why you might not want to be friends wirh them anymore, lol.
