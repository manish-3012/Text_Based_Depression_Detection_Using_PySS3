(also in hindsight, I really should've said something sooner, she and I did so much together I can't believe I waited so long to say something lmao

\- we spent that last 2 valentines days together as friends, got each other cards and stuff

\- she took me out to lunch on my 18th birthday, just us

\- she texted me like, a few minutes after midnight so she could say happy birthday as early as possible last year

\- we used to go out together a lot before covid hit)

Sisters, bros, and non-binary pals, love is great, if you think you're ready take the chance and tell them how you feel, I actually feel like I'm walking on air right now. WOO!!!
