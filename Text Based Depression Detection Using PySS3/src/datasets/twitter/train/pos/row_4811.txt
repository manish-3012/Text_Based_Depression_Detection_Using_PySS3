Building a sensory deprivation tank (at home) for cuties. Sensory deprivation tanks are real things used by real people. They are meant for the purpose of cutting yourself off from reality basically. Most of the time they are incredibly relaxing and can give you a pretty awesome experience (not always, there are some people who have negative experiences). How they work is by cutting you off from light, sound, touch, and even gravity can be an incredibly relaxing an therapeutic experience. Athletes, spas, and more use these tanks for relaxation. Make sure you are not alone if you do try this. Seriously NOT ALONE. 


Alright hereâ€™s the fun part
- First, you will need somewhere to put all the water. A large inflatable pool should do the trick
- Secondly, you will need to fill it up about 10 inches high full of water or 150 gallons.
- Thirdly, you need Epsom Salts, 800 pounds for that amount of water. Gotta be careful because people might think you have an addiction to bath salts. 
- Fourth, make sure you kiss the pool and say love you because yâ€™all gotta make it feel special and you are cuties so win win

After this happens you should be able to float successfully in the pool. You can do it in the tub but you wonâ€™t be able to stretch out as much. Make sure if you try doing it more then once you replace the salts. You can also add things to maximize your experience such as a blindfold, ear plugs, black out curtains, etc. This might sound familiar, such as the tank they built in stranger things but I promise it will be nothing like that. Even if you donâ€™t have a mind blowing experience just taking a moment to be fully aware of your thoughts and not worrying about anything else can still be fun. Thank you for coming to my TED talk and have a great day my darlinâ€™s!
