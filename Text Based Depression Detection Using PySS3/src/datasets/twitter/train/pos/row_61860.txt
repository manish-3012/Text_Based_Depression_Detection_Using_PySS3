Random thoughts about myself I feel like I get way too excited at the beginning of any kind of friendship with people and I set myself up for disappointment. I also really love the thrill of meeting a new person. Like I genuinely find that knowing new things about someone who was a total mystery to me is amazing. I immediately think omg â€œthis person is just like me.â€ They could literally just have the same music taste as me and Iâ€™d literally be in love with them. Itâ€™s crazy. Thereâ€™s more to people than that. I need to accept the fact that theyâ€™re not my twin or something, theyâ€™re completely different and I need stop being so fucking excited. 

I rush things too fast at the start. I might be super friendly. I give people the impression that I wanna be friends with them forever bc in that moment thatâ€™s how I feel. Slowly over time I lose interest. Itâ€™s crazy bc at one point this person was everything I could think about and we clicked so well. Now suddenly I have no interest in talking to them anymore??

On another a completely different note, this is also something Iâ€™ve noticed about myself. I treat guys and girls equally. Like I talk to a guy in completely the same way Iâ€™d talk to a girl.
Iâ€™m straight btw and actually I donâ€™t know what to do if Iâ€™m genuinely interested in being with a guy. This is super weird but I feel like once things start getting sexual or something, theyâ€™d lose interest in me?? Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™d not wanna get to know me anymore and I donâ€™t want to be used like that so yea. I can have a friendship with anyone but I canâ€™t help but see things like â€œwhy would a guy talk to me a lot if he didnâ€™t want a relationship?â€ I donâ€™t know if that makes any sense. I feel weird talking to guys sometimes bc it feels like the only reason they have an interest in me is bc they wanna be with me or something. That might sound crazy idk.
