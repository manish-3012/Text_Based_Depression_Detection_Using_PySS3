Happy Mid autumn festival ! Today's Mid autumn festival, or known as the mooncake festival. Falling on the 15th of the eighth month of the lunar month, it is a traditional festival celebrated by the majority of East Asians, with elderly, adults, children all celebrate the day when the moon is allegedly the most round of the year by playing lanterns and eating mooncakes.

What makes this day so special is that it represents the traditional value of family in the east Asian culture. In ancient times travellers were left with tears when gazing at the luminous moon, as a constant reminder that a few thousand miles away, their family are also looking at the same moon, praying for their return. The moon has become a symbol of home, family, and that's why we treasure this day so much, as it's the day we can meet up with family members whom we haven't met for a long time.

Yet especially in the current disastrous year, it's clear for us that while we are living in comfort, people are suffering from war and the pandemic, losing their beloved ones, perhaps in just a few miles away. We all live in the same sky, staring at the same moon, yet our fate utterly different. This brings the second value of mid autumn festival: think of others, think of the ones suffering, think of the ones struggling, and show sympathy to them. 

I wish you had a Happy mid autumn festival reddit, but also please, celebrate it with your family, and be sympathetic to those who can't.
