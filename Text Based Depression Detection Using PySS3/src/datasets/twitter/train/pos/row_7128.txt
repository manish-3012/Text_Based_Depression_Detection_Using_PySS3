God my cramps hurt so fucking much Iâ€™m scared,, the past couple of months i havenâ€™t been able to get out of bed while on my period and it was fine cuz we were online for school, but now I have to go in-person and Iâ€™m not gonna be able to stay in bed all day,, idk I might just skip a couple of days, this sucks :I
