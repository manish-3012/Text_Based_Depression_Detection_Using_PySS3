I agree with the OP poster about what happened to that french teacher, it was completely wrong however I wanted to add a few things OP didn't emphasize to much on. 

France is having a rising anti muslim rhetoric and narrative going on and we muslims are being scapegoated for the presidents political gain, not to mention because of this incident hate crimes have already happened such as two hijabis getting stabbed, what was there fault? The same could be said about the teacher, what was his fault? People need to realize extremists are not part of islam nor are they muslims.        

As muslims we are constantly put in situations where if we dont accept things that go directly against what we believe we are seen as backwards or radicals etc. Why is there this selective free speech? Muslims feel deeply offended when non muslims start making pictures or make fun of Our Prophet. Why is it free speech to make fun of our religion but not free speech to make fun of Jews or france etc
Why is there a blatant double standard?
