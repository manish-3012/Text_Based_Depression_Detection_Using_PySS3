What has been your most interesting valentines day experience? This is my experience. I asked my crush to be my valentine and she hasn't had one before and she was happy but just didnt know what to say. I asked her about it and she said she just never thought someone cared about her enough to ask her. I got her some of her favorite simple things; a special soda, her favorite candy, and stuffed dog that was really soft. The worst part about the whole thing is that I could see she was starting to get sick and she was sick for like a week starting the day before valentines day.
