first time getting ghosted I was talking with this one girl and we were doing alright I guess, we never fought or anything and we were just good friends I guess. Then one day I went over to my best friend's house and I told her that I wouldn't be messaging her a lot because I didn't want to ruin the day (note: it was his birthday). I got back and started messaging her again and just got left on read. Idk what I did wrong. I feel like I was being too nice or mean without realizing anything. Maybe she felt awkward. She just didn't respond to any of my messages at all. I feel really sad and I just can't get it out of my head and rn idk what to do. I know it doesn't sound like a big thing but keep in mind I really liked this girl. and she just ghosts me without an explanation.
