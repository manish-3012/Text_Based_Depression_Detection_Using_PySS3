Almost 20 years and not once I've lived for me Is dropping out worth it lol. One part of me says to stay, it's logical and yanno. But another part of me is like "why am i doing something (school) I don't like? Why am I alive when so far for nearly my entire existence I've done things I never liked?" 


I don't even fucking know what I like. Because for almost 20 years I've just been a stupid puppet and I'm almost ready to start generating money for all these rich cunts. 


I wish I was born rich and I could just drop everything and move to the countryside with some alpacas
