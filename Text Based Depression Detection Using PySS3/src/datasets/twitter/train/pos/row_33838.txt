Iâ€˜m pretending everything is fine but it Isnâ€™t I was going to do some homework and searched for relaxing study music. I found [this one](https://youtu.be/gtmzPUmq7XU) after a while I got bored and got on reddit. I went to the subreddit r/sad I looked at the post and started to see more and more how they related with me. In general I have been sadder than ever before, school grades are sinking, social life shrinking, getting dumped by my crush I for the first time thought Iâ€™d have it good with. And the best is every day my mom comes into my room after work and asks if everything is all right, I always say yes but itâ€™s not Iâ€™m not fine, and the music I mentioned earlier just makes everything sad times 2.
