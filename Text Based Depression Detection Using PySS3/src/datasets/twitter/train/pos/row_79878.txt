Need some smart ass teens right fucking now. K I'm in chemistry and I have been fucking up real hard. This week we have been going over some pressure things but I think I passed out mid class because I have no idea what I am supposed to do. I need to find out how to figure out what the r value is and I have no idea how to do it. R =moles of gas im pretty sure if someone could do a step by step explanation on how to find it ill buy you a game up to thirty dollars on steam. The teach made it so some of the answers will not have an r value so I'm just going to put three equations up.
1) 4.00L V1 300K T1.  =      ?V2.     280K T2

2)2.0L container holds 0.0700 mol oxygen gas at 150kPa. Find temp

15.5 mol oxygen is contained in a 25.0L storage tank under a pressure of 15.0 atm and qt temp of 20.0 C. If the temp changes to 0C and 1 atm and the volume increases to 30l how many moles stay in the container.

All I need to know is how to find r with the answers of these problems I can solve them myself but I would like someone to say in detail how you got r and how they used the values in what ever fucked up equation is needed.
