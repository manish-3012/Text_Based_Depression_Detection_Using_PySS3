i hate this school year so i'm a freshman, and all i've learned about other 9th graders is that we're all assholes. it can be kind of excusable since i live in texas, so everyone's been raised by insane people. thing is, this is the type of dumb that you can only see in people during these situations. my school's had over 5 covid cases (they have us go to school in person but it's optional. i go in person.) and despite this, everyone wears their mask under their nose or chin, some even take it down once they sit by their friends. it makes me really annoyed, and me and my friends have tried to help encourage wearing our masks properly only to be told by other kids that they don't care. it's like they don't want to look at the obvious signs that they're fucking up their own health and other's.

anyways, thanks for reading this godawful rant. hope you're all having a nice day/night
