Forced genital mutilation is NOT OK! For both Male and females, People who are born and get a genital mutilation is NOT OK! Primarily happens for relligious reasons. People often act like a newborn is their property, and do whatever they want to it. That is such a twisted and Disgusting thought. I am very, very Mad at my religious parents for circumsizing me at a few weeks old without any thought. No, i don't give a fuck that the Qur'an says you should do it. Foreskin is NOT a birth defect! And don't get me started on the consequences, especially for females. Trauma, pain, infection, permanent damage and way more. Please for the love of god never Force that on anyone, if i wanted to get circumsized i would have done so. A simple thing that now single handedly has made me very insecure and regretfull. The thought of forcing circumsizion on my child... Id rather die than violate them like that. We should ban forced circumsizion. It's MY body. And so, MY FUCKING CHOICE!

Im sorry for any spelling mistakes English isn't my first language
