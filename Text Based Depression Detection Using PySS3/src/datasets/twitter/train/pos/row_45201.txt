Anyone else wish they could just....talk to someone at night. And then, both of you just fall asleep. Ahhh, it seems so euphoric. Peaceful, and.....amazing. I can't imagine myself talking with a girl until we both sleep together. Girls sadly don't find me interesting. But, I'm sure it will happen eventually.
