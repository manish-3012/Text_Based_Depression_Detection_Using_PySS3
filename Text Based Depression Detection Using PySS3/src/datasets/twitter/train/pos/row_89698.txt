Super straight is a sexuality because of the existence of Skoliosexual If skoliosexual is considered a sexuality by the lgbtq* community then super straight should as well because they are opposites of each other. Iâ€™m not saying super straight should be part of lgbtq+, it should just get its recognition as a sexuality if you agree that skoliosexual is a sexuality. Yes Iâ€™m super straight but I do not have anything against trans people, I just donâ€™t want to date them. I do not affiliate myself with the neo-nazis on 4chan who actively hate trans people. I just donâ€™t want to be hated for not wanting to date trans people.
