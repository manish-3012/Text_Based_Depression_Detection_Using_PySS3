Feeling Suicidal. FNAF 8 seems to be approaching fast and has no signs of stopping, sadly it seems to be mainly PlayStation 5 exclusive. And by no means does my step-mother nor father want to buy me this console. The chances of them even remotely considering it decreased as well after they bought my 9 year old sister her first MacBook Air Pro.  What do I do? I feel like I will never be able to experience this FNAF story expansion myself. And it's driven me to the point of depression.
