Just broke up with my girlfriend ðŸ˜Ž She has to move away for her dads work, and since she is moving farther she isn't gonna be able to go to the Highschool that we were orignally going to go to, she is going to one closer to where she is gonna live

&amp;#x200B;

So we both mutually decided to break up, I'm feeling kinda sad about it but we both know we did the right thing, we'll find someone else that isn't 40 kilometers away ðŸ˜Ž

&amp;#x200B;

We did the right thing
