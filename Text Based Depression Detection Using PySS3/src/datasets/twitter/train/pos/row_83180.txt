So apparently itâ€™s transphobic to not be attracted to trans women. I just canâ€™t comprehend how it is. I still accept them for who they are. I let them be. I stay the fuck out of their way but just because Iâ€™m not attracted to them Iâ€™m the worst human being ever.

And Iâ€™d just like to clarify.
Your standards arenâ€™t discriminatory no matter what. Unless you want a racist, transphobic etc. SO then itâ€™s a bit fucked up yo.
