My mom thinks she is motivating me, but she's not. I am plus size, and I am happy the way I am. This doesn't mean that I don't want to get fit. It's just that after a long time, I have finally started accepting my body. 
My mom wants me to lose weight and workout but the way she tells me to do that is not nice. I don't know how to describe it, but I just don't feel good about myself after listening to what she says. I feel worthless, I feel like crying, I sometimes even think about running away from it all. I have never worn a dress before (I hope the english is correct) because my mom thinks that I should wear clothes which cover up my body and hide my weight. I am tired of it. This is the major reason why I'm planning to pursue my further studies abroad. I just want to get away from all this. 
I take a balanced diet, I avoid all junk food. My weight gain is primarily due to hormonal imbalance. The doctor said that it's common. 
I lose all the motivation after listening to my mom. If she thinks that she is encouraging me, then she's wrong. I know she means well, but I just don't feel like talking to her at times.
