I think having kids too early is dumb I mean like 19-20-21 etc because I want to live my young years to full. For example:

I want to drive in Swiss Alps with a Porsche.

I want to rent and drive an open wheel race car (here in Istanbul Park you can but I am too young)

I want to visit a lot of countries alone or with a gf or someone

I want to achieve atleast some of my dreams

and I am actually curious about what you guys think about this subject in general. What do you think?
