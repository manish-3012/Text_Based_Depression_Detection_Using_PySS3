Do You Run a Small YouTube Channel? If So, I Have Something That Might Interest You. I have my own YouTube channel. I have been working on it for the last two months. I am already at one-hundred and thirty subscribers.

I have my own subreddit. I created it a while ago. I want to put it to use. I want it to be a place where people can post their videos, and have others find/watch them. There are a lot of subreddits like this. With that being said, A lot of them are strict. Here, there will not be that many rules at all. Almost everything will be allowed.

This will not work if people do not join. If you do not have a YouTube channel of your own, but want to support smaller creators. Joining could be a great way to do so.

I do not see a problem doing this. I do not get anything (like money) from promoting this subreddit here. I have looked all over for a community like this. I have not found one yet. I want to make one. That is what I am going to do.

I believe that is all I wanted to say. If nothing else, I will watch them. I enjoy watching smaller creators videos.
