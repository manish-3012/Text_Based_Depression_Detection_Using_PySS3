I did it! I slept facing the wall.

Overall it was a good experience, it was comfortable and a nice change. Only downside was getting stabbed in the back by shadow demons but I was willing to forget about it due to how incredible my neck feels after a change of position. 

4/5, Would recommend to a friend.
