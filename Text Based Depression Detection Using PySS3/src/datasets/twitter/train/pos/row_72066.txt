I feel like I need medical attention. Not serious medical attention, but some. I have this thing where I eat stuff that gives you nothing, like paper and all that, but I also &gt;!pluck my pubes out because I don't know.!&lt; The stuff ain't that serious, but I mean, I need some help you know? Maybe I have other things that I don't know about.
