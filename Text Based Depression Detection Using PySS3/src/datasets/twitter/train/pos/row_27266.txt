It's my fault. Today I came to school without my PSVita, and told my friend, "I didn't bring the Vita, now can we be friends?" And they said "I tried to fucking explain to you that it wasn't your fault." Then when the bell rang, they said, "We can be friends but, if I'm mad *It's NOT about you*". So that's my fault. So I devote the song by my Dad -"What Was I Thinking?" To what I've done.
