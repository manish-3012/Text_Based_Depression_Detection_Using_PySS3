Add an ðŸ˜ emoji to the end of any sentence and it becomes funny (in a sexual sort of way) So today I was bored and I sent a message with the wrong emoji at the end, and I realised this.

"Did you eat breakfast yet ðŸ˜"

Try it, any ordinary sentence becomes funnier if you add that emoji to the end. Let's all have a good laugh.
