Pray for dis boi So idk if this is real but if this guy jokin then he worse then all u fukin fake depresso espressos so I'm playing ps4 in a group for this game I play we trading  and there's this guy with no mic, we do a trade and hop in a 1 on 1 private party, so we negotiating trades and I realise he has everything I have and better so he gives me like 3 or 4 free things I thank him (this guy has no mic btw) and he goes afk (at least I thaught cuz he was tmoving but obviously he has no mic) and he wasn't messaging me either cuz he was messing me to talk so he comes back an Di get hit with this fucking BOMBSHELL, he says he just puked up blood, (never met this guy bfor) and I thaught he was like 13 or something so I'm like wtf bro u ok wtf see a doctor (at this point we stop why we doing in game an just chat) so he said he seen a doctor, he has an appointment tomoz or soemthing like dat and I say as a joke (dw I knew him well enough to know it wouldent offend him) horror films have taught me if u puke blood u die, so he messages me with another fucking bombshell of, "well if I die who Ia gonna take care of my siblings" again I think he like 13 at time and I say well parents?, so this is why that was a bombshell, "I have none, they died* so I'm feeling like wolds no1 bitch while guy is on about how he has no parents, siblings   he looks after by himself, pukes blood while undiagnosed all this shit and does it by himself and that is the worst part, if he genuinely died or something happened, his siblings would have to go thorough thier big brother dying, thier parents dying and shitty Foster care, I wouldent wish that on anyone,




TLDR:
19 yr old guy lives with his 3 younger siblings he's thier only parent figure, he pukes up blood, has to hide it from them as to not make them worried and has to go to the doctor for it and is undiagnosed, all the while if he is 19, he can't afford 3 kids, no wife or anything and the expensive American hospitals and doctors, genuinely this is the closest to crying the Internet has made me In a long time.






if you EVER feel like u are struggling remember this guy, you are Lucky, we all are, ik ik only 13 and sound like a boomer but omg I had to share,



Sorry if I misspell etc on phone
