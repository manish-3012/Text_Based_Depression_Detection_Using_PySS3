One of my older stray cat is raping the smaller ones What the titlte says. We have a bunch of stray cats we feed daily (14 cats, youngest 3 months old, oldest 2.5 years old). So there is this 7 months old male cat trying to rape the 3 and 4 months old. It can't really do anything since both young cats are male and he just, you know can't stick it's pp, also I checked the young ones' necks' (male cats bite that spot while they're mating) and I couldn't see or feel anything noticable other than slight wetness. But younger cats get very uncomfortable and meow for help. What should I do to stop that mf?
