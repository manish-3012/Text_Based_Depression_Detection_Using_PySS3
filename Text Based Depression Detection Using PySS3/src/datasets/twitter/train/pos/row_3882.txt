Is this leading someone on? After you break up you think maybe it was a mistake so you two talk about getting back together then they start really changing so you decide to be just friends. Then after they say that they really want you back you say that maybe in the future and actually mean it, like not right now but maybe someday we could get back together. Is it leading them on if you ment it?
