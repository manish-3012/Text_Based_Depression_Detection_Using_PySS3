I missed two online classes today. So basically, I was doing all virtual classes this year until Monday of this week. Now I'm in hybrid classes, which means I'm in a group that goes to school on Mondays and Thursdays and stays virtual for the rest of the week. There are two other groups, one group goes to school on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the other that stays virtual the entire week. Today is the only day that all groups are virtual. 

Before Monday, classes started at 9 AM. Since I had study hall for my first period, I started classes at 10 AM. Now, first period starts at 7:30, meaning I start at 8:34. For some reason, I thought that since today was the only all virtual day, the classes would follow the prior virtual schedule. I was wrong obviously. At the time my first class started, I was on the road to my mother's house with my Dad. 

I only realized my mix up 30 minutes ago when I tried logging into my 2nd period Google Meeting. There was no code posted so I asked my friend from the class what was up. That's when I found out for sure that I had missed an entire class. 

I have a solution though, I'm gonna email the teachers of the classes that I missed and tell them that I had technical difficulties. I'll finish the work that I need to do first, then I'll email. Fortunately, both the teachers are pretty chill and I think they'll understand. I would tell them the truth but then if my mother finds out she'll scream, yell and, threaten me like she always does. I really don't want to have that sort of thing happen again even though it happens like every day I'm with her.

Thanks for listening. 

TL;DR: Forgot the times of my classes, missed two of them. Had a solution.
