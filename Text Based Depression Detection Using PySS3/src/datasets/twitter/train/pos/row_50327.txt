Problems with my friends So my friends have been playing games that I don't really find entertaining or fun to play recently. But I usually still join the Discord call just because it's boring to sit alone and play games. I usually just sit there quiet because I literally have nothing to say. But recently they've started noticing what I am doing. Every single 
 time I talk to them they just have to ask me "Why do you even join the call if you're not going to say anything" which I reply with "I don't feel like playing games alone" And then they reply with something like "You could atleast say something. Don't sit there quiet and just leave at the end of the day." like wtf am I supposed to say? You guys are a full squad playing your boring game. Oh and can't forget how they complain about when I join the call and sit quiet all night. And then the other day I join and ask what they're playing. Since they're playing something I don't like, I leave the call. And guess what happends then... They start complaining about that shit too! I join the call to feel less alone. And when I try to bring up a convo they're too busy sweating at that game and just tell me to shut up. And since were in the same class and we're seated next to eachother, they just can't shut up about it. And I try to respond to what they're saying and they just interupt me with something like "Bro why tf are you scared of ants" I am not, I was afraid of insects in like 3rd grade not anymore. But they can't seem to shut up about that either.
Thanks for reading this messy rant of mine. :-)
