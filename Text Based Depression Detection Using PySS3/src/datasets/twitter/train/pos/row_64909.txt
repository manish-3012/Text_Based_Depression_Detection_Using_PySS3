Remember this my subreddit mates  

Memento mori, autem memento vivere  
Remember you will die, but remember you have to live.

All life must end, it's sad, and scary I know. I have existential death anxiety, it keeps me awake at night sometimes. Then, I remember this, I remember that I must die, but I must also live. I might be kept awake by the fear of death, but I also remember to be happy and remember that I was given life, and I must not waste it fearing death.
