Hey guys, donâ€™t ya hate when your moose drinks all your maple syrup? Ok, now that the Americans are gone, why is labour day on reddit spelled â€˜Labor Dayâ€™? Iâ€™m in Canada and I will not partake in the â€˜Labor dayâ€™ sale reddit is holding until they spell it right like the origins of English come from, England. The disrespect. Just spell words differently.
