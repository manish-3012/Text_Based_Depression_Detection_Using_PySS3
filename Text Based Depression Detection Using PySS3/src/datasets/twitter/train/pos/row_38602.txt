Stop farming celebrity's deaths. (Long post, sit tight) You know the person which died recently who I am talking about. I don't want to say his name because I don't want to disrespect him in any way by referencing him in this post, but may he rest in peace. Now, to those of you who make memes about the death of celebrities, or as a matter of fact anyone, you are honestly so scummy. Seriously, you could have picked any other method of karma whoring, but instead of faking yourself being a girl, or showing a Lego set you completed you decided to go with a lolz funny epicness 100 shit meme about how funny and memey that person was. Well guess what? SURPRISINGLY these people have a life outside of just being a meme. Some of the internet famous 'memes' had wives, husbands, children, families, but instead you choose to remember them only as a meme. If y'all want to make memes about someone, go ahead, but if you want to make memes about someone's DEATH, then I honestly don't want to ever meet you. This is my opinion. If you disagree, then downvoted me on your main account and all 17 of your alt accounts and fuck off, I don't want to argue with someone defending karma whores who disrespect people's deaths.
