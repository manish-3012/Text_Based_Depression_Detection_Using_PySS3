Something about childhood/adolescent abuse. I've been interested in the topic "Serial killers" for a while now. I've read many articles, and books. They all had one thing in common: A traumatic childhood.

Ed Gein, for example, was severely abused by his parents, and thus developed severe schizophrenia, which, among other things, led him to do horrible things. When I read his biography, he seemed like a decent, kind child. He could have grown up to be fine. To have a family. 

I could name many others now, but I think Ed is the best example for now. 

He did terrible things, but imagine him, laying in his crib, playing in the living room, doing homework, having hopes, and dreams. Just like you, who reads this.

I know this was long ago, but did things really change that much? Abuse will never die. Neither will murder.


It hurts me to think how many people suffer the same. With no help to get. The neglected people, some of them becoming school shooters, or other criminals. Because hate is a strong feeling you can hardly eradicate. 

So, please, if you know someone suffering from abuse, neglect, or anything like it, talk to him. Listen, to what he has to say. Prevent him from having further mental damages, or doing damages. You will never really get much credit, but know, that little things like listening to someones Problems can prevent so many pain
