I love like every part of this gorgeous, dry, hot state (except like Clovis and people from NorCal excluding the Bay Area and my family, you guys are like hella weird), from the San Joaquin Valley to the Sierra, to the coast range, to the coast to the urban cities, to that 86 meter deep hole thatâ€™s the hottest place on earth, to all the people in the Bay Area, SoCal, and central California (which we should really come up with an abbreviation for)
