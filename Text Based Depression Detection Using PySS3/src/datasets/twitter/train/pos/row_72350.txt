School stress Hello, I am a freshman in high school, and Iâ€™m really REALLY far behind in almost all of my classes, I plan on doing tutoring and getting help , but for the past 3 months Iâ€™ve kept on falling behind and procrastinating on my work, Iâ€™m still doing stuff from week 3 in engineering while everyone else is on week 12, Iâ€™m starting to fall behind in algebra, Iâ€™ve never been doing great in science, Iâ€™m also taking band and can barley read sheet music, point is. I needed to get this all off my chest and I decided that Reddit was probably a good place to do it, Iâ€™m stressed out and behind mostly because I didnâ€™t pay attention during online classes, Iâ€™m super stressed and crying almost every other night, I am gonna do tutoring like I said and try to get back on track, I just wanted to let somebody know. 




Thanks to anyone who reads this
