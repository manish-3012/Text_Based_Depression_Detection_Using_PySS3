Lmao you knew you knew how much of an overthinking mess i can be

you knew how much i dislike certain things you do because it hurts me self-esteem

you knew that i was hurt and cried over you. it wasn't the first time.

everyone told me to cut ties with you but i stayed longer than i should have.

now we don't talk anymore but i don't know why i'm still thinking about you everyday.
