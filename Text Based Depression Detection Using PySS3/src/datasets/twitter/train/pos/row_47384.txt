I got ignored by the most important person for me So I'll try to be quick. About 9 months ago I met a girl, she lives pretty far from me, we quickly became very good friends and now text/talk on discord almost 24/7, I think I feel something towards her, no more details neccesary. Recently she had a really bad day, she just sat down and cried for a few hours. When I found out I just activated the mental help mode and tried to comfort her as much as I could considering the distance. I just let her talk about everything that concerns her, r/wholesomememes and r/eyebleach also became handy. We spent maybe two hours talking, until she finally managed to calm down and decided to go to bed hoping she'll feel better next day. I'm sure she noticed my efforts. Or did she? Fast forward to today. Rn I'm having a slight mental breakdown, a combo of everything going on around me, but I won't get into the details. She's the only person I'm feeling comfortable talking about it to, so that's what I did. The only respond I got was "F" and "Don't cry, go to sleep". Now she's on discord playing some games with a couple of her friends. I don't know what to think about it, I feel both surprised and devastated tbh. I'm almost sure I'm exaggerating but I just fucking can't.
