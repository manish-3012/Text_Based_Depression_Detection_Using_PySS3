I can't wait to go to college and leave California Seriously, I can't wait to get out of California. I mean, I love the weather and the beaches here a lot (as well as In-N-Out Burger) but I have lots of bad memories growing up here. Never could relate to anybody growing up in the city I live in, my parents went through a nasty divorce, other family members that moved from Washington to California with us all of the sudden ended all contact with us and moved to a random city in the midwest. And last year, a massive fire engulfing my family's whole neighborhood (our house was one of the very few that survived thankfully, but the scene of seeing homes next to us disappear everywhere was terrifying).

I've also never been able to find any friends here either.
They're all super rich egoistic brats who don't talk to you unless you're on the same sports team as them or live in a huge mansion. 

And lastly, the whole state is on fire right now. I can't wait to get a fresh start in college somewhere a solid distance away from this state.
