I dont know how to starta conversation with a girl I think is cute I blame zoom University. She's super cute and I've stopped paying attention to class bc im watching all her quirky note taking. We have a class group me so I have a way of contacting her, but I have no idea what to say. Like a question ab class would be best in the class chat and I feel it would be weird to tell her I think her hair looked cute today. Any suggestions?
