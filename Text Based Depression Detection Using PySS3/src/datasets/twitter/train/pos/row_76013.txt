Being single is not bad at all Very unpopular opinion: I rlly donâ€™t see why ppl are so obsessed abt getting into a relationship? A big part of love is just chemicals? Like itâ€™s not even real? I get that horniness could play a part, but I personally donâ€™t find it that bad. Idk, maybe Iâ€™m just very quirky and weird and oh so special
