Here's a message to my 11 year old self. First of all fuck you, actually genuinely fuck you for being the most annoying piece of shit who thought that be random or loud was the key to getting friends and being sociable.

Fuck you for making your future self have to work extra hard to make people start to like me, a lot of people still mock me even still.

Fuck you for being so utterly pathetic and cringe that you cried over the smallest things and made people mock you even more.

Fuck you for making me look at my past with embarrassment for my actions.

And biggest of all FUCK you for doing such stupid and embarrassing shit that still gets people mentioning it now and again.

God I hate myself.
