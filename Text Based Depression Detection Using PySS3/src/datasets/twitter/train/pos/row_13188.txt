I've been noticing a double standard. Hey I'm an 18 year old, agender (AFAB) living in Manhattan. I've recently noticed some major double standards with how enby people are treated in our society.

I feel like I'm able to get away with a lot less because of my sex and gender then what most cis people (or even binary trans people) can.

I tend to get a lot of flack (both internally and externally) if I ever talk about liking girls. I'm often thought of as a creep or pervert if I talk about being attracted to a girl or if I flirt with a girl, even if a cis boy would be considered conpleatly normal and fine.

I feel like in many ways I'm really limited in how I can Express my sexuality. Being agender a lot of people think of me as asexual (not that there's anything wrong with being asexual), and people seem really surprised when I'm interested in dating or appearing attractive.

I'm currently also looking to have top surgery and nullification, I'm too afraid to talk about it with people outside my family (and the anonymous internet). Its definitely something I understand people's uncomfortablity with, but a binary trans person could probably at least get away with mentioning wanting surgery.

Am I overthinking this? Have other people experienced this?
