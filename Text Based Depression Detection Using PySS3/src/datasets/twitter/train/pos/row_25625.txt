Any Teenagers who love The Lawrence Welk Show? I am 15 years old and absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE The Lawrence Welk Show. It is my favorite TV show ever. The Lawrnece Welk show was a musical varity show that ran from 1955-1984. every saturday on ABC for the first 16 years then in syndication in for another 14 years.  and since 1984 in reruns on PBS. I love the old-fashioned musical numbers and the talented cast members. I am ofter teased at school for loving a show useally watched by a 65+ audenice. I do not listen to any modern music i only listen to Lawrence Welk. My Grandparents got me addicted to this show. I don't like modern rap or pop it dosn't sound like music. My favorite cast members are Jo-Ann Castle and Sandi Gail And Mary Lou. any other teenagers who enjoy this "Wunnerful" Show every saturday night? I am looking for friends to start a Lawrence Welk Discord.
