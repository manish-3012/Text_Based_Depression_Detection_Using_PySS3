WE GOT r/DOGDIET BANNED! ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ If you didn't see, r/dogdiet was a sub about raising dogs for slaughter and then cooking and eating their meat. And yes, there were pictures. After it got banned this morning, the sick fucks got back together to create r/humanedogdiet, which also got banned almost immediately. As an animal lover, I'm so happy to see Reddit finally taking a stand against animal abuse, animal slaughter, and meat consumption.

r/butchery is an even bigger sub with the exact same problems. r/carnivore and r/meat are also similarly disturbing. NSFW btw, don't click if you don't like seeing dead animals. Reddit, I think these three need to go next. Who's with me?
