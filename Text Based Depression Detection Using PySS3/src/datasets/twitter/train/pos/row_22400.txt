i hate awards now that i said that i will write some dumb reason why truly to bait you into thinking youâ€™re annoying me. 

ok real talk. any post about awards is a post asking for them. some are super simple like saying â€œ i donâ€™t like awardsâ€ then they get like 50. some are more complicated but anytime someone brings up not liking awards they think youâ€™re dumb enough to fall for reverse psychology. 

someone is definitely going to say â€œwHaT aBoUt tHis poSt. iSnâ€™T it aSKiNg for reWarDs.â€ and yea ofc but itâ€™s also a tad bit of a PSA.
