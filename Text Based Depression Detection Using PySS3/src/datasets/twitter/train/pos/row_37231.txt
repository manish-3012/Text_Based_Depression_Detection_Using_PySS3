Music recommendations #4: Songs to play while overthrowing the government Alright now to my one of my favorite genres of music; punk! Hereâ€™s some songs I would play if I were overthrowing the government. In no particular order:

1. Wild In The Streets by The Circle Jerks
2. Voice Of Memphis by Negro Terror (not racist, just give it a listen)
3. Rise Above by Black Flag
4. Think Again by Minor Threat
5. I Fought The Law by Dead Kennedys

Drop some rebellious songs below and Iâ€™ll add them to the list.
