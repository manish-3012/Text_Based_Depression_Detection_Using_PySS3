Fearful - A poem written with auto fill on my phone: Fearful of the words I have the big dumb question I have the big dumb question that I think the best way to do it is to reproduce the same time that you have in your house and the other people that I'm going for the job are you in the future and the future will be more like the end of the day and the future will be less than the first and the next one will be the first time that you can get the best you could ever do for your home in a clan and it will take you a little longer to be a little more like a commercial airliner in my area were you in the closet and the future will be a little more complicated than the rest of the world was gonna roll me I ain't gay anymore but I get skinny femboy and the girls are not robots anymore.
