In almost an instant, I die as if I were born again. Mom Taking away from the fact, that we're both gone. I want to talk about you

All the time you eat and drink yourself. Tricking yourself that. Younnenver existed

I know what you did. What you are now can't change what you did. Please remind me when you stop looking like you hate me..
