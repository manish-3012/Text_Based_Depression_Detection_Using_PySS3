How can I communicate with my teenager sister more? Iâ€™m 22F and my sister is 15F and I moved out about 3 years ago. Weâ€™ve always had a pretty good relationship and I can confidently say that she feels safe and loved whenever sheâ€™s around me. She has fun with me whenever I visit and we used to do a lot of fun stuff together when I was still living with my family. I feel the same way when Iâ€™m around her too, sheâ€™s the only person I show my true goofy self to. 

The problem is, ever since Iâ€™ve moved out we donâ€™t really communicate anymore. Iâ€™m not really a texting type of person but I make sure to remind her how much I love her every now and then by making her playlists or getting her gifts and telling her I love her verbally. But thatâ€™s about it, thatâ€™s all the talking we do when Iâ€™m not home with her. 

I just miss the old days and I wanna be her friend. My family moves a lot and she has to change her school almost every year so she doesnâ€™t have enough friends to make her feel less lonely. Also for context I might mention that sheâ€™s into anime and Japanese culture and sheâ€™s a huge kpop fan. We donâ€™t share these interests but I totally respect it and want her to feel validated.
