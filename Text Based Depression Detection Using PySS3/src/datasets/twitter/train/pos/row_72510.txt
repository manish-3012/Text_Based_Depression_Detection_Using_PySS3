talking about my day because my friends don't care  today was pretty ok, i had a dream where i had different friends. kinda pathetic to say i enjoyed it so much, but i did. my friends aren't bad, not at all. just sometimes they can be quite.. something.

 also, i was forced to go to the mall. it wasn't that fun but i wore my favorite shorts, so it was ok. and i also got redbull which made me happy :)

 the whole day i was feeling kinda neutral, which isnt that weird or unnatural to me anymore. i got a bit happy in some parts of the day, but mostly nothing. meh.

 i asked my dad if we could drive around the neighbourhood, which is really fun to me. just looking at the streets at night while listening to songs, imagining things. while he was driving, he said something about "skating" and "skateboards" and the fact he wants me to try it sometime, cause i always wanted to. so thats a possibility ig.

 thats all, im kinda happy just talking about my day to whoever decides to read all of this. bye bye.
