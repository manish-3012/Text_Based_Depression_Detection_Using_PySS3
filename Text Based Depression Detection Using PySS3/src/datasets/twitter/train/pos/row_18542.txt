I hate having thin blonde hair Like, sometimes its really nice cause I can go longer without shaving and I feel like its probably easier to wash than thick hair would be...but when it comes to how it looks, it just looks bad af and theres only so much I can do when it comes to styling it. Like, theres not much I can do with it and a lot of what I'd like to do with it, I cant because if I tried styling my hair like that, youd just see straight through to my scalp cause it's so thin
