I am done with computerscience class We all needed to make our own website from scratch.

I worked 2 fucking weeks on it and didnt sleep untill far after midnight.

During my presentation my teacher said it looked great and that i could be proud of it.

Then i got my grade a while later, 5,3 out of 10

He said it was because my website didnt look the way he wanted and that i didnt use JavaScript while that was never even talked about. He had never said anything about javascript.

Fuck that teachers and fuck this shitty subject

All that work for a fucking shitty grade
