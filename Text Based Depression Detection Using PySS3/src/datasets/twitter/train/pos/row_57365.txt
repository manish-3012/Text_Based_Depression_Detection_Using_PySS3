Wouldn't it be far more beneficial for everyone if instead of putting a little symbol next to a post, giving an award simply wired money straight into their bank accounts? I mean, who actually cares about a little smiley face next to their post?

Some of us are broke af, and can use that money for important stuff... like chocolate, and drinks, and more stuff to junk on while we scroll through reddit.

Thank you for listening to my idea to improve the lives of all redditors.
