Checking how u/blondy712 is doing Iâ€™m curious how lots of redditors are doing currently because they are real people who have real lives. Ima start with our good friend Blondy. Idk how to get them to see this post though but I assume itâ€™s by putting their username. How was your day friend. Were you drinking tea or something today. Hopefully we can all tell her something nice. I like the idea of doing these though so we can make people have a happier day maybe. I have a list of people who I want nice things said too :D
