Let me tell you a story... (Reads in a anonymous tone)

Years ago a tradition came up, based off the movie of hocus Pocus, every year on Hallows eve, there is a box sent to each person's house...

 what kind of box?

 What hides inside the box?

HUSH... and let me tell you. A candle... a small simple wax candle that is sent to every redditor in the world. Each person is give one with no note, no instruction, only the numbers 12:00. Each person exactly lights the candle at 12, but theres one catch, the flame turns orange. But isnt that the color or fire? No silly, if a virgin pure enough holds the power, the flame will turn orange if not, white... 

So remember, NNN is upon us, and virginity is cool remain pure and one year maybe one year. The flame will turn orange for you...
