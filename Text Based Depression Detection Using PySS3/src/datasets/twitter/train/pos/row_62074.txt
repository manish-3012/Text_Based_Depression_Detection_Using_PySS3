Life hates me So, the unthinkable happened last night. A girl actually said she kinda liked me. You'd think that'd be cause for celebration right? Well, there are 4 important facts that ruin everything. 

1. She doesn't like the memes I send her. Some she just doesn't understand, and others she doesn't think are funny

2. She's a coworker. Dating coworkers isn't exactly a good idea.

3. She's got a bf. She claims that she almost broke up with him last week, and that their relationship is going down, but I'm not entirely sure I entirely believe her.

4. Last, but most certainly not least, she's a minor, she's 17. She is so close yet so fucking far. 

I hate that I kinda reciprocate those feelings. She is so fun to talk to, and is one of the few people I can stand to be around at work (not that most people at work set a high bar or anything). I swear I ain't a pedo... I am cursed to never have any success relationship-wise.
