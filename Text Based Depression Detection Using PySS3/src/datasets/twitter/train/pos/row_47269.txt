Am I the only one that does this? Do you ever just think about your past, then remembering commenting or posting something highly controversial that could haunt your future? 

But you cannot tell if you're overreacting or being reasonable? Then you already imagine being canceled on twitter for absolutely no reason? 

I have a problem...
