Broke my knee three days ago skateboarding This shit kinda sucks lol, my 18th birthday is on nov 19th and I got a Plateau tibial fracture a few days ago,
 
essentially what happened is my acl is still intact but the bone on the bottom thatâ€™s itâ€™s connected to has broken off so my acl isnâ€™t connected to the bottom of me knee making it literally impossible for me to use my knee to move my leg or put any weight on it.

I was bombing a hill on my skateboard and tried to bail and run out of it and twisted my knee and felt literally the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. My knee was hurt so badly I couldnâ€™t even crawl out of the street a fell in and multiple cars stopped thinking I just got jumped or something since my skateboard kept going and wasnâ€™t near me.

Moral of the story is when you do something always commit even if you fail (and fall) itâ€™s always gonna be better than bailing and giving up. My knee would not be broken right now if I had committed and fallen. You always gotta send it lol, full send.
