Finally recovered from my caffeine, drunkness thingy. Man it was crazy. I was tripping. Not that hard, but it was pretty mild. 

I got dizzy, and lightheaded, and just started blurbing out shit. 

Man it really opens your eyes.

Also, now i know how to properly drink an energy drink.

Cause what i did is I drank the whole can whole (:
