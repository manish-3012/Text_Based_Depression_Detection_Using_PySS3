*depressing rant ahead* So I am in 12th grade and live in India, which means that I have my board exams and college entrance exams(jee mainly) and I honestly feel I'm gonna fail, and I don't know what to do with myself, I have probably destroyed my life, I don't know what I did the whole year all I know is that I haven't completed any of my syllabus(which is completely my fault and a bit of online medium) and idk what I'm gonna do now
