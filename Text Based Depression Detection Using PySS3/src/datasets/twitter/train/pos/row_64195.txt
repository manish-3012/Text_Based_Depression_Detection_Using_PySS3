I need to rant somewhere, I want to yell into an abyss without sympathy, just a void Warning you will read a life story style rant so enjoy/s

So anyway Iâ€™m a failure to my parents (my dad accepts it and basically treats me as such, my mom makes excuses) I had to quit school because I was failing all my classes because I was too stupid to understand, Iâ€™m on my second job and the expectations are right back as high as my previous job. My adhd is Fucking horrible lately, along with my depression meds making my aggression come back (the one I broke my hand with) I still havenâ€™t gone to the hospital to check it out. My anxiety is at an all time high bc Iâ€™m also hiding the fact Iâ€™m bi from my semi homophobic mom and extremely homophobic dad. My suicidal thoughts are getting far worse again, I just want to od on all my old meds and slit my wrists so that the meds dilute less and one will kill me. Fucking hell I hate my life and I want to be alone forever like I deserve. I also am really unmotivated to do anything but play mc and work on my pc

Thx and rant over :/
