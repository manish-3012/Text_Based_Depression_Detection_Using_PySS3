Im happy now, and its finally not temporary-happiness. Im finally happy. After all my years of struggling. And with puberty most of my insecurities (weak jawline/chin, squeaky voice, height) have all been fixed, and my eczema is fading. Ngl, i still have to lose some weight. 

But im happy. :) thats it, thats the post lol
