It's time reddit actually uses their influence for something good, and something we can actually achieve. Usually when people get together on reddit, they fail miserably. Like when reddit tried to cancel tiktok, and when they tried to cancel nestle. Reddit simply does not have that kind of power. 

However, there was one movement on reddit thats....Painfully unfunny, but has good intentions. The r/hydrohomies movement, where redditors would encourage each other to stay hydrated. I think this went beyond a meme, and actually made some people drink a bit more. 

However, a lack of drinking isn't what most teenagers (Reddits main demographic) are suffering from. The big issue that we've all been ignoring, to the point in which it's being normalized is none other than sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is something very common. Staying up late at night is something many of us do. A lack of sleep can not only affect your performance, but also your mental health. 

Reddit should start making painfully unfunny memes about getting 8 hours of sleep. Do I expect reddit to completely fix every human beings sleep schedule? Absolutely not. But I do believe that if this movement got big enough, we might be able to remind some people of the importance of sleep, and get into the habit.

THIS is something reddit can accomplish. We can't bomb nestle, but we can get some people to stay in bed longer.
