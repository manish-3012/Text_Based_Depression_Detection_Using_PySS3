YOU'RE NOT FRICKING BEING THIRD WHEELED Something that has always bugged me is people saying they're being third wheeled if they're in the presence of a couple. I understand being third wheeled, I get it, it sucks. But gosh, heaven forbid I coexist with my girlfriend! There have been cases where we are several feet apart talking about our history class or something and someone in our big group said they were being hard core third wheeled. Like dude anyone who doesn't know we're dating doesn't have a problem in the slightest. Why do you? The second they find out were dating they start saying they feel third wheeled because I'm having a conversation with her in it? That's all, no cool ending or anything I just needed the world to hear this. Alas I leave you with my final word. Penis.
