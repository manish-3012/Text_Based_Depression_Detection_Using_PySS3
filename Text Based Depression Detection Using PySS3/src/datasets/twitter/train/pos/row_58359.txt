bro I'm so fucking pissed lmaooo I had a discord server with nearly 2000 members, and this one grown ass man was on it, and when he was told to calm down for getting pissed at the game we were playing, he called me a stupid kid and told me not to tell "grown adults" what to do

even though it was my fucking server, and him being a "grown adult" doesn't mean he doesn't have to follow the rules to not be toxic

so anyways, I ban him, since I had an issue with him before, and everyone flips tf out on me

this guy had been sitting there, having to repeatedly remind me that he's "grown" so I shouldn't be able to tell him what to do. 

so I probably overreacted, but since I already had been frustrated with the server before (getting dms telling me to kill myself, saying how awful of a person I am, etc.) I decided to delete it.

and one of my old mods made a new server but with only like 100 or so of the old people. and someone decided to dm me an invite for whatever reason. and so I join, and everyone's fucking hating on me. people who weren't even in that game where the "grown adult" got pissed

I left because all everyone wanted to do is hate me, and when I came back the fucking "grown adult" was a mod

so basically, this guy had to protect his fragile little ego, got banned because of it, and then got made mod even though he's gonna abuse it and he's clearly not intelligent enough to be a mod
