I just need somebody to hold me while everything falls apart I want to be loved and held :( I wish a friend were here cause all I can do is cry lately, everythingâ€™s going to shit and I canâ€™t do anything about it so I kinda just need to be helped and held and hugged and told itâ€™s going to be okay
