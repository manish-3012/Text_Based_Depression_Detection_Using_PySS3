Alittle bit about me, incase we have something in common I'm 18M from Grand Coulee, Washington. I'm into Heavy Metal, 80s Rock, 80s to 90s(Old School) Rap, and alittle bit of Country. I like playing games, drawing, working out, and listening to music to relax. If you find something we got in common, that's good to know! If your wondering something about me, go ahead and ask cause I dont mind answering.
