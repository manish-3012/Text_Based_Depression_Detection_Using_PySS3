This is a rant Me and my two other friends used to love Star Wars back in elementary school. We watched the movies, the Clone Wars, Rebels, read the books, collected the LEGO's and consumed any other content we could get our broke hands on. Star Wars was basically a second religion to us. It was fun, it was exciting, it taught lessons and it brought us together. It was our favorite thing ever, and we got bullied for it, but that was fine, because it was our own special thing and we were happy.

Fast forward a few years to middle school. Disney starts releasing the sequels. Me and my friends are super excited, the majority of people in my school are interested, but don't care all too much. My friend group can't wait to see what Star Wars has in store for us.

Now we're in high school. There's more interest in Star Wars. The rest of the sequel trilogy is getting released. The Mandalorian gets released. Everyone is loving it. All the popular kids love it and 'Baby Yoda' (it's name is the Child get it right). All the popular kids pretend they're nerdy and cool because they've seen Star Wars and wear Star Wars x Adidas shoes. The same people who bullied me because I liked Star Wars, pretend that it's so important to them, while me and my friends sit alone, after poring over thousands of hours of this beloved content, without getting noticed.

TL;DR : I'm mad because me and my friends have always loved Star Wars, but now it's becoming more mainstream, and the same people who bullied us for liking Star Wars like it now.

I realize this probably wasn't what this sub was intended for, but I was just mad and wanted to say this.
