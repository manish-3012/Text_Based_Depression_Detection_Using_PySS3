Racism online I am sick and tired of all the racist things I'm seeing online and everyone applauding saying they're, "spitting straight facts" I'm just going to say this. White people, you are privileged in our society(in America at least) because of the lasting effects of history. I am NOT saying all white people are racist nor am I saying they want to be above minorities, and I would never say that, but the people who do not admit to this and get offended by movements like BLM and counter with All Lives Matter, that is racist. The phrase itself is not racist, and I agree with all lives matter but the motive behind is racist. Also, JUST BECAUSE WE LIVE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WHITE PEOPLE ARE PRIVILEGED COMPARED TO MINORITIES DOES NOT GIVE YOU, PEOPLE OF COLOR, A RIGHT TO BE MEAN! Seriously, it's not cool and just messed up, and if a white person gets offended by your insults it's not being fragile, it's called being a human being with feelings. we minorities, above all, should know what discrimination feels like no matter how small so why would you do it to another person.
