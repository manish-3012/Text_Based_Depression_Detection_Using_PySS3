Happy Diwali r/teenagers!! So put on your saris

It's time to celebrate Diwali

Everybody looks so jolly

But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali

The goddess of destruction Kali

Stopped by to celebrate Diwali

Don't invite any zombies

To a celebration of Diwali

Along came Polly

To have some fun at Diwali

If you're Indian and you love to party

Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwaliiiiiiiii
