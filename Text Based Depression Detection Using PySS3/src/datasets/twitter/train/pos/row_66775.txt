Why are anti-china (usually males) often racist towards Asians? Now I donâ€™t support the Chinese government, so we can get that out of the way. 

Iâ€™m asian and Iâ€™ve noticed that a ton of these guys REALLY seem to hate asian people. Like just making fun of Asians a lot. And just racist to Chinese people in general. Like r/Chinesetourists and r/China are really nasty. 

And they always say â€œI just hate the Chinese government, not Chinese peopleâ€. Yet it really doesnâ€™t seem that way.
