NNN: Day 1 of 30 Day one. What can I say. Woke up this morning  and mentally prepared myself for the month that is to come. I know very well the challenge that I have to face.

There was one moment in the day where i went jogging and there was a lady jogging in front of me for about 300 meters. 

I had a pretty good view of this ladyâ€™s backside for about 3 mins. I wasnâ€™t to tempted in the moment, but later in the day the memory of her ass hopping up and down made me a little bit exited. But I did not give in.

But Iâ€™m not nut deprived enough yet to get that tempted off a memory.


Day one successful.
