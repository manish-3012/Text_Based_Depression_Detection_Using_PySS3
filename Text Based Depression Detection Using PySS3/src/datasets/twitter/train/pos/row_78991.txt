If you donâ€™t include any paragraph breaks in your huge-ass rant I refuse to read anything you just wrote How hard can it be to separate that giant hunk of text once in a while? All you have to do is finish your sentence, hit enter, and keep writing (If youâ€™re on Mobile you have to hit enter twice).

Look, I just did it, sooo easy.
