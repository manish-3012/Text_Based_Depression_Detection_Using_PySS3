I got ganged up at school last year and the teacher gave me 3 days of ISS It was lunchtime and was hanging out with my friends while I explained what stardew valley was, and these dicks walked up and dump a bottle of hand sanitizer on my head. I said what anyone else would do and said WTF.

They said I was talking nerd, called me gay, and threw me to the floor and kicked the shit out of me. My friends who (like me) aren't strong tried to pull them off while I was struggling to get up.

A teacher came by and saw me pushing them away from me said, and I quote, "OP WHAT ARE YOU DOING! YOUR MOM ISN'T GOING TO BE HAPPY THAT YOU ARE PICKING ON THESE KIDS!" I was dragged to the principals office and while I tried to explain they wouldn't listen because they thought I learnt this behavior from video games (yes they did say that). I had to be in ISS for 3 days while the other kids got a pat on the back for defending themselves.
