I feel like I wanna make music lowkey It's a very bold thing for me to say in my position but I've been going wild these past few nights. I've been listening to 6 albums a night and drawing and writing n shit and honestly I cant get away from music.

Idk yet but I hope I make something of this sudden spark of creativity
