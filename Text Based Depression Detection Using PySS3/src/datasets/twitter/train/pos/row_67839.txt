Idk man I just feel like pure shit I have so much to do and so little time. I feel like Iâ€™m doing a shit job with my assignments, I took hours just for a few lines. Iâ€™m crying rn I just wanna give up. I already missed a deadline. And I know you shouldnâ€™t compare yourself with others and all but my friends did an amazing job with their assignment which makes me feel even worse.

Sorry for ranting I didnâ€™t know where else to say this
