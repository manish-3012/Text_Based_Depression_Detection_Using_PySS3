so being trans sucks now i have been out to some friends and asked them to call me my prefered name.and pronouns, now 2 friends adapt to this quite quickly and started doing it

however 1 friend literally called me my prefered name, followed it up by groaning saying 'why did i say that' and proceeds to deadname me

what's up with that? you literally got it right and then go on and do that 

just don't do this, it is hurtful af for the person since they do not associate themselfs with that name and clearly trusted you enough as to come out
