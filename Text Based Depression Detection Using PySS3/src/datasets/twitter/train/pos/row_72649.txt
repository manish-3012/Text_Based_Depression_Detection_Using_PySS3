They say "it's OK to be you" No it's not! Everytime I try to be myself, I fucking regret it everytime! If I do not get out of my way every. Single. Day. To be someone I am NOT it's always the worst day ever. Why does everyone act like it's ok to be different, to have each his own way of engaging social activities, when they don't even slightly accept someone who behaves different from the mainstream? I'm not even mad about the fact in itself, but I'm upset at the blatant hypocrisy that people so carelessly show each day, without any problem.
