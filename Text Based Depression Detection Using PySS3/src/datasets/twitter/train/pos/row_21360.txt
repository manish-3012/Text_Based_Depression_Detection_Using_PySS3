My parents are such bastards When they speak their mind, I can't get angry. When I speak my mind I get grounded.

When they insult me for being stupid, I naturally get back at them. And guess what. I get screamed at. 

I keep a normal tone every single time. I'm doing ok in school and I still get screamed at for being stupid. There's so much more but I can't get into it
