My poem I made, thoughts? Excuse the dark side

From that we can't hide

Swearing, just more fights

Curses, and bad sights

.



It looks like having black eye again

Knuckles bloody from relieving pain

Now the sun is brightest red

Can I use your blood to paint? 

I can't promise it won't hurt

It will, if you wanna truth

You can't escape I already tried

and all you'll wish is gonna die

.

They'll pretend that they don't see

They'll play blind, guess who's the creep? 

Guess who is now defective? 

We've been accused wrongfully. 


.


Now we're jumping from night to night 

Exhausted and sleep deprived 

and I just want to fall asleep 

Never wake up, rest in peace 

.

Dreaming without boundaries 

Hold my hand and I would lead

later singing lullabies

and hope our world never dies &lt;3
