I hate this whole KAM thing Why the hell are people saying that? I see so many posts of people complaining about men, and how terrible they all are. It genuinely hurts being hated just for having a dick. Just today I saw a post that says â€œdonâ€™t protect your daughter, educate your son.â€ I find that statement stupid. At heart it has a good message, but WHY DOES THE GENDER MATTER? I understand that most rapists are men, but women can rape too. Men can be victims. All that posts like this do is make male victims feel scared to tell people about what happened. Itâ€™s gonna make guys feel like theyâ€™re in the wrong if it happens since â€œall men are pigs.â€ I canâ€™t understand people some times. Instead of focusing on men being the problem, why donâ€™t we focus on RAPISTS being the problem, because thatâ€™s the real problem here, not an entire gender
