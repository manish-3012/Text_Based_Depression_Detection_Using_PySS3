A liitle shity situation pls read Hey I'm gonna type fast and I really need help. You know I went to discord like 3 days before because I just wanted to make my friend from high school happy that his friend joined the server. Suddenly after 3 days I'm the management of the server. Well everything was going fine until his other friend gave me a massage and told "How much you'll get to fuck the server?" i was shocked and I asked "why do you want to this?" He said "he didn't gave me a good role" and after that he said "if you don't help me I'll attack the server anyway" I'll tryed to tell to my dear friend what shity situation he is into but he's offline. What should I do?
