I just got a girls number for the first time ever. This was the first time I went out of my comfort zone and asked for a girls number. I need some advice from girls and guys with game. So we were track and field practice and we never met before. She introduced herself and I did the same back. We kept on talking till practice ended and had an easy fimd keeping a conversation going. I then asked for her snap but she couldnâ€™t find her account, so she went out of her way to give me her number. The number is not fake if any of you were wondering. 

If a guy asks for a girls number and she gives it, what are the chances sheâ€™s interested? Do girls just give out their numbers to guys who they think they can be friends with? Like what are the odds she finds me attractive?

Iâ€™m not going to jump the gun or anything Iâ€™m just confused on the intentions. Like if a guy asks for a girls number and she gives it is that like a non verbal agreement that they are interested in knowing eachother more? Also, what are the chances she just gave me her number because she would feel bad saying no? 

Thanks for all your help!
