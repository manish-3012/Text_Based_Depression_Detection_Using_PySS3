Am I gay if I date and fuck a trans guy? So I've been thinking about it. It's possible for someone(female at birth) to identify as a man without changing his genitals from a vagina. In other words, this person would still have boobies, a female genital, female voice and female face but male characteristics and personality. Would dating this person make me gay?
