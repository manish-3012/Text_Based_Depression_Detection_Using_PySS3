Anyone else develop a fear of growing up? I just turned 16, and today my parents gave me a car for my birthday. It was cool at first, but then a sudden fear of all the responsibility came after. I have no idea how to maintain a car, what I need to do, etc. That kinda just turned into a realization that I'm growing up, and that I'll have a lot of responsibilities I'm not prepared for. Anyone else feel this?
