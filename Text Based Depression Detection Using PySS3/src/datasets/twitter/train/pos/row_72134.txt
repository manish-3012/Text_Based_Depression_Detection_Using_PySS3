Good day I was at my friends house with my girlfriend, and my friend has a motorized golf kart. The kart doesn't like to turn going fast. I was driving and my girlfriend was sitting by me. I went to fast and couldn't turn and ran into my friend's dad's Hummer and my gf's arm hit the car and fricked up her arm. 

At the end of the day the Hummer isn't damaged and gf's arm isn't as bad as we thought and she isn't mad at me. Got that going for me.
