Rant about my friends It was my friends birthday yesterday, but since we canâ€™t get together we wanted to do a birthday Zoom for him. I begged them to have it yesterday but everyone wanted it today at 4:30.

I wanted it to be yesterday because I have twin siblings who are 3 months old, my mom is a single parent. I have to help her otherwise sheâ€™ll go insane! Yesterday their Nanny came over to help out so I would be free. But sheâ€™s not coming today so theyâ€™re just having to go without me!

And then I get called a bad friends for not being able to hop on the zoom!!!!
