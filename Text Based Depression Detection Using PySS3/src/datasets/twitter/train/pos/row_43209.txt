The Tunnel is an Illusion, the Light is Now (129) I used to always think that I had to fight through the tunnel to get to the end, then one day I realized that the tunnel is an illusion and the light is always available to connect with **now.** 

I am not saying that anxiety is fake, that depression isn't real, because that is something i have lived with my whole life, but rather that the mindset that the "light", better known as happiness, positivity, optimism, comes with time, is **fabricated.** It isn't a time where we reach where we are "happy" all the time, "positive" all the time, "optimistic" all the time, "never in pain", but **rather that these are all achievable daily, through moments.**

It is all about the precious moments we are given. It is all with the moments we are given to breathe, be alive, try again and try something new. 

In the moments, minutes, hours, days, months, years ahead, find moments of light during each day. When we find it even for a few seconds, it will continue to grow, the more we try and find it daily and with time, the light will always be able to connect with; **through the highest of highs and lowest of lows.**

**I love you.**
