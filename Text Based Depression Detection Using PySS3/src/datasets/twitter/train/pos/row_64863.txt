r/all is so shit right now. Literally EVERY post has something to do with one of the following: Guns are bad, BLM, and Trump. Does anyone else have anything else to talk about besides obcessing over the U.S.? I'm American and even I get annoyed at how much attention is put on the U.S. There are a few cool posts, but it's mostly been that.

Rant over, thanks for listening :)
