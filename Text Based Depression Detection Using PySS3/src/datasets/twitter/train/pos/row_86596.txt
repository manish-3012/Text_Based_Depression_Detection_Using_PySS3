Would you kindly? â€œOh, can you go grab my plastic ring? I left it across the pathway of burning hot coals.â€

â€œOh, and over the path of hot tar, I left my framed picture of Gordon Freeman. Can you go get it?â€

â€œOne last thing, your baby sister forgot her brain over the path of thumbtacks covered in gorilla glue. Think you could- cool.â€

â€œOver there by your 2 brothers, I left my jar of pickles. About two miles back that way. Joshua is a good marking Iâ€™d say. Heâ€™s waving his hands and touching his finger to it. Think you could grab it?â€

No.

â€œGod, you could do ONE thing for this family, you know! You never do anything!â€

My family would never take advantage of my willingness to help

Of course not
