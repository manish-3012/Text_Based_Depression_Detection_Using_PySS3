quick note about Super Straight This is coming from a trans person so hear me out.

"Super Straight", the name is the key part to sounding offensive. Why? Because it implies that trans women are not women. That is the only reason.

Making sexualities is a normal thing as you have seen from within the community. It's been a heated debate among trans people about whether genital preference is transphobic or not. I will say **No, it is not transphobic.** It is fine to not want to date someone with specific genitals. 

* I would like to bring up the sexuality "skiliosexual". It is the attraction to genderqueer people. Mainly used by genderqueer people, it's not hateful towards non-genderqueer people it's just preference.

With that preference is fine even us trans people have them. Most people don't have an issue with preference, it is 100% ok to not want to date a trans woman. As long as it's not about disliking trans people &amp; just about things like genital preference.

The name super straight itself is fairly transphobic **but** if you identify that way due to genital preference then there is nothing wrong with it. As said before, if you aren't identifying that way to hate trans people then I don't see the issue.

If anyone has a different view point on this, feel free state your thoughts.
