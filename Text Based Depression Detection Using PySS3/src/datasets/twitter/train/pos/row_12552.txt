Why does this dude keep coming back to me? we had a thing but it ended shortly because he lost feelings for me so we stayed as friends but things got so toxic that we had to take a break from each other and even after the break, it was still toxic so we stopped talking to each other.

until one day, when he thanked me for being his friend even though things didn't work out (it happened out of the blue) and we started talking again.

there is no toxicity so far, everyone's cool with each other, no one is mad at each other but I'm still going to be cautious around him.

but i'm curious why he keeps coming back to me?
