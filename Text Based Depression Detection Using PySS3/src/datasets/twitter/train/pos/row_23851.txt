A bittersweet farewell Iâ€™ve been a long time lurker on this sub, in fact Iâ€™ve never posted until today, but just know Iâ€™ve been silently laughing alongside all of you for years now. I may not be a boy in a skirt but Iâ€™m a boy whoâ€™s turning 20 in an hour. 

You all have been amazing and I know things will go great for all of you in the future. Youâ€™ve been with me through good times and bad and I just want to say thank you. Thank you to everyone who makes this community great and whose stood by me for the last 7 years

Youâ€™ll all have a special place in my heart, and Iâ€™ll be checking back from time to time to see if your crush said yes or not. 

Now comes another chapter in my life. Goodbye everyone, keep being awesome!
