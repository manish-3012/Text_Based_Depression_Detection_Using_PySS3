I feel depressed I try my best in school, yet still fail.
My parents took away my privileges for everything. I'm not even allowed to communicate with friends or use the internet, even for school. They want me to study for 8 hours every day.
I'm not allowed any free time, even on the weekends. I'm not allowed to have fun in any sort of way.
I feel like my parents just want me to succeed and don't care about my mental health or anything else in that case.
I'm always stressed and anxious.

Please, if you could, leave some advice or encouragement. I'm at the lowest point possible.
