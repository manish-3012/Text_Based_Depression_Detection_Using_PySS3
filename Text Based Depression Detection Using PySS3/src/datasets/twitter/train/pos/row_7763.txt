is this another feeling my friend calls it an episode but that doesnâ€™t seem appropriate. the days where i just speak every thought without regret. i do everything text everyone call everyone. a lot of confrontation. 

are those the days where i am actually myself ? i canâ€™t differentiate between the real world and my daydreams. i donâ€™t know myself. 

i canâ€™t tell if this feeling will last for 5 minutes or 5 days. i donâ€™t know what this feeling is but itâ€™s familiar. i am grounded enough to know itâ€™s going to happen. so does that mean itâ€™s fake. am i just overreacting

because if itâ€™s coming i need to tell my friend. but i donâ€™t want to alarm her. i go through this every night. 

i think everything i think is fake. iâ€™m fine. iâ€™m not feeling bad. iâ€™m doing good. iâ€™ve been doing so good. 

if itâ€™s happening itâ€™s not going away anytime soon
