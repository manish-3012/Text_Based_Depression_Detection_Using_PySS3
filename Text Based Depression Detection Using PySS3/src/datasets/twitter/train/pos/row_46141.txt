Should I swap to PC or PS5 this generation? In defence of PC:

 All of my friends are going to get the PS5 but most games like CoD and Minecraft are featuring cross play between platforms.

Itâ€™s better spec wise in the long run since the PS5 will eventually be outdated spec wise and struggle to run new games while i could keep upgrading to match it.

Technically more games with an infinite amount of Indie games, with them staying or just coming to PC first.

More things to do, I could play games, watch videos/movies/TV shows, photoshop, video edit, etc.

Mods.

Iâ€™ll be able to play Xboxâ€™s exclusives like Halo or Gears of War

Keyboard &gt; Controller

Backwards compatibility with games from the 80â€™s available 

Variable resolutions and refresh rates.



In defence of PS5:

Iâ€™m a big fan of Sonyâ€™s exclusives including Spider-Man and Ratchet and Clank which I know i wonâ€™t be able to play on PC.

The SSD is way faster with it being 9,000GB/S while an NVMe m.2 is 2,600GB/s.

I currently own a PS4 and Iâ€™d need to keep it if i got a PC to still play my old games

Games are better optimized for console meaning in the long run i wonâ€™t need to upgrade for a long time

The controller is incredibly impressive with tons of features Iâ€™ll never get on PC

Consoles are arguably safer from hackers and viruses.

Backwards compatibility with PS4 (We donâ€™t know if there will be PS, PS2 or PS3 compatibility)

I prefer physical media and discs over just a digital file any day
