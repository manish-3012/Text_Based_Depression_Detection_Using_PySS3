In terms of asking out your crush. Do it!

Litteraly the worst they can say is no (well not exactly but you get the point).

I asked the girl I like out, and guess what? We dated for a couple months. I didn't wait super long to ask her out, I jumped on the chance.

Here's another example. My buddy and I are at a basketball game, performing with the band. My friend is a total dork (so am I, but that's beside the point). He decides to ask out literally the hottest cheerleader on the squad. She said no, but the fact that he had the courage to do it is amazing!

So I encourage yall, if youre on the fence about asking, DO IT BEFORE IT'S TO LATE!

Okay that's all, thanks for reading yall
