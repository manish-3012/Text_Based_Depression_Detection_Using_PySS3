Ghosting people is an ass thing to do This guy from school I know became friends and would chat on discord, then he would start ghosting for months at a time, then responding to me like itâ€™s absolutely nothing.  The longest he went without messaging me was 4 damn months. And now Iâ€™m blocked because I didnâ€™t respond to him in a fuckin week. It really enables my â€œI donâ€™t need other peopleâ€ moments. I rarely talk to anyone new or try to make new friends because I donâ€™t like ghosting. That shit is rude, just tell me you donâ€™t want to talk to me you rotten, shit marinated ass.
