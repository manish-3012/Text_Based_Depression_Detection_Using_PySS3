New friends I saw the thing about self post weekend and thought Iâ€™d give it a go. My names Ethan, Iâ€™m 17, I live in Indiana but Iâ€™m moving to Pennsylvania shortly, I like to run, play video games, and sleep. Little Ceasers owns my free time and soul for the cheap price of 8.50 an hour. Some of my favorite games are: Minecraft, Fortnite, and PokÃ©mon. I donâ€™t care about your zodiac sign or political preference. I literally (yes literally) drink about a 2L of Dr. Pepper every time I work. Also if you want to be friends just say so only I require is for you to be yourself and fair warning if I add any of you on snap you will most likely not get a serious selfie of me and Iâ€™m shy as hell.
