Should I go into medicine, which I kind of want to do, or should I major in performing arts, that Iâ€™ve wanted to do since I was 2? I donâ€™t know what to do, but at my school, we have to decide what path we are going to take in January of next year. I really want to do performing arts and Iâ€™ve been told by a musical director that i have a future in that industry but Iâ€™m still not sure if the demand for musical performers is in demand or if Iâ€™m any good at what I do. I just need someone to tell me what to do.
