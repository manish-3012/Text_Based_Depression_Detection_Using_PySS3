IM SHOCKED So we probably all know Rocket League right?
And if u play it, u probably heard about Alpha Boost (official name: Goldfever).
And the worth of it is 800.000-900.000 ingame credits. Assume that 1 credit is 1 cent (Eu)
(500 credits is â‚¬5 aka 500 cents).
So if u take that 800.000-900.000 and calculate that to Euroâ€™s, its worth is 8000-9000 EURO!!??
A boost wich is worth 8000-9000 euro is just insane.

So after some research, i found that it isnt even in the top 10 most expensive ingame items, a planet in the Game Entropia, called Calypso, the planet sold for $6.000.000?!!!!!! Wth
