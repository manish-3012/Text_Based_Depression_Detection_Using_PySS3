i am having a dilemma right now tldr at the bottom


ok so two african americans just murdered a student from my country

it is now bulding a somewhat white lives matter too(not racist, just saying that the whole fucking world hates slavs) situation, and an anti-blm sentiment in people

now i am having a dilemma: what do i show as my public opinion?

Here are my positions on a lot of things that could serve as arguments:
i used to have an anti blm sentiment since may and all the riots

the post of the video lacks evidence(city, location, date, time), which makes me think there might be some manipulation of the public opinion

the murderers deserve to be hanged

ok i know that no one will read this so:


TL;DR

Should I side with the stupid public opinion because I said something much earlier than everyone else, giving me popularity; or do I go my own way against the majority?
