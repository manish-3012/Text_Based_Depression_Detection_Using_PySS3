I just got banned from dank memes :D Yesterday I created a post that wasn't a repost, the template was the same and the "bot" said that the post matched 94.8% with this post and I got a warning of getting banned so I decided not to post in r/dankmemes but the next day when I opened Reddit, Surprise I got banned from there for 90 days for that post only, you will not get the post in my profile because I deleted it when I panicked. So ya can we have some f in the chat for me
