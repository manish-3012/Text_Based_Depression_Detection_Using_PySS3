today i drank 3 caffeinated beverages, ate 2 granola bars, and a medium sized burger, and i took excedrin, and tums itâ€™s 9:18pm, and thatâ€™s all iâ€™ve consumed today. i walked like 2.8 miles today (about 2.6 more than usual) 

iâ€™m low key having a panic attack, iâ€™m hyped up on caffeine, i feel like iâ€™m going to vomit, and i have barely enough energy to move
