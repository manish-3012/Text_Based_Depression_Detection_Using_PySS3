The pandemic was the best thing that happened to me  I hate school. I fucking hate school and I always hated. The routine of having to wake up early to experience literal TORTURE and then get home late, not having time to do anything I like to get in bed early and then repeat everything for years and years AAAAAAAAAHRGHHHHHH! My head was drained and I just wanted to get out of this endless pain... and then... I heard that schools were going to close and my hapiness, was... there, after all that pain. Besides the excessive amount of work that teachers send, I prefer anything just to not having to go to school. And obviously I don't like that people are dying that's horrible, but the feeling of not leaving home is so satisfying to me and everytime I hear in the news that we are maybe going back to school I feel fear, a pain in my heart, it's hard to explain... It was what my head needed and I really needed this for me. I don't understand how everyone wants to go back honestly. If you lost someone to covid I'm really sorry and I wish you and your family the best.
