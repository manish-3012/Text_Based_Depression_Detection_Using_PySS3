What's wrong with you? What's your problem? These are phrases that I constantly hear from my father. He thinks that because I cant socialize I'm going to end up with antidepressants and going to the therapist all day. 

I've shown him the r/socialanxiety subreddit lots of times but he continues to think that I'm not normal. I've tried explaining to him that I want to socialize so fucking much but he won't understand. 

&lt;&lt;If you want to socialize why dont you just do it?&gt;&gt; he tells me like it's so easy.

He thinks he can &lt;&lt;fix&gt;&gt; me by taking away my phone or my playstation but doesn't understand that when he does that it only makes it worse and makes me feel not normal

He thinks that I'm going to end up like one of those people that sit in the dark all day and marry their phones.

He has been making me go to all these places and socialize but after 4 years of pretending I am having fun you become a pretty good actor and I make him believe I'm having fun but on the inside I'm dying because I feel awkward.

Thank you for letting me rant. I know he's heart is in the right place but he is not helping. Sorry for the bad english it's not my native language. Also I have posted this story in r/socialanxiety
