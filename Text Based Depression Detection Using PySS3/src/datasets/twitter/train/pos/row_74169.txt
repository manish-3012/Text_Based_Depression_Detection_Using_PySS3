Why don't we just make a new website/app as an alternative to youtube where content creators alike don't get demonetized and psychologically tortured With the demonetizing thing, why doesn't someone just make a new modern youtube that pewdiepie promotes and everyone moves there and no-one gets demonetized and actually makes money without censoring and relying on sponsors? There's no way for legitimate new creators to surface without being viral or being Cocomelon. I get there are limitations on viewers but if heaps of your favorite content creators moved there we could start a revolution and push out all the Jake Paulers and children onto the crappy site that promotes scummy energetic brainlets than just some people making some funny stuff and commentary
