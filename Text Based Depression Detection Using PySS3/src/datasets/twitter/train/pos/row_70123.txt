I have spent the past year listening to 14,000 songs that were posted to Reddit by independent artists so that you don't have to! Whenever I ran into one that blew me away, I added it to this playlist. I have also created a full archive of 3 different platforms organized via genre. Check comments!  

Playlists:

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1q8wRIhriTOBWbi81cPujs?si=B_zArvdWSXqff842OhuC9Q)

[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kittensrjerks)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDAUpL6G6fmimmp4GkHJmQ/playlists)

Here are all the songs that I've found split into genres for Spotify, YouTube, and Soundcloud below. **There are over 100 total genres to pick from!**
