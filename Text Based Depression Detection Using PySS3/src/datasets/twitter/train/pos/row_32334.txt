Anybody feel like all the pretty/nice girls are all taken, or would just never be in to you? Lately I've been seeing this girl I work with, she's really cute and super nice! Found out she has a boyfriend. I also have this really pretty/nice girl at school I chill with at class. She has a boyfriend also. And the rest of the girls I would be interested in, I could tell just wouldn't be interested in me. Anybody else just feel straight hopeless?
