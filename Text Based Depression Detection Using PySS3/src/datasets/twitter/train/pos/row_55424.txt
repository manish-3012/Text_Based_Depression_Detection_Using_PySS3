Mom says really hurtful things when sheâ€™s mad She calls me wicked and useless cause I didnâ€™t want to wash the dishes. She literally begged me to go with her on an errand at her job and then when we got back, she told me to wash the dishes. I was visibly annoyed cause we just got back home and my brother WHO PUT THE DISHES THERE WAS JUST SITTING THERE. I asked why didnâ€™t she tell him to do it. And that was it. She does this all the time, she even compares me to my dad who physically ABUSED  her. I donâ€™t talk to her a week and then I forget about it I donâ€™t want to do that anymore cause she just does it again. Also the things she says are the complete opposite of when she praises me, calling me so much helpful.
