Can someone explain this to me?! I dont know, I just seen some Vegan girl going on about how her "DaY wAs rUiNeD" because KFC told her they didn't have any Vegan Burgers and i got angry.

Vegans and Vegetarians can eat/not eat whatever they want BUT... Jesus Christ WHY go to KFC and act surprised that they don't have any Vegan Burgers. 


Go to fucking Subway or something, did they forget what is served at KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN??!

Its like going to a plumber because your car engine just dropped out WHILE your fucking roof caves in.

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk
