A girl might like me? Let me tell you something that happened today at school. 
There are 3 main people in this story. 

Me 
Girl = R
Boy = C

Sidenote: There is a running joke in class that R and C like each other in class

It was a normal class day, until a rumour popped up about people knowing R's crush. C and S knew, and I kept bugging them who it was. C might have slipped up and said that R liked me, which was a large surprise to me. I asked C who it actually was because I don't think that anyone liked me. He wouldn't respond to me. 

A few hours later after lunch, everyone is talking about "how C told him about it", which my mind automatically went to how C told me how R likes me. I asked another mate about it and he told me it was about R's crush. 

Am I missing something or am I connecting the dots properly? It's possible C told someone else during the time of our first and last class. 

Also our next class together isn't til Monday so the wait is gonna suck.
