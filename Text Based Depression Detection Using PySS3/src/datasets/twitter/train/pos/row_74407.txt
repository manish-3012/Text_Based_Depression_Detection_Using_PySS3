this sucks... Today i have to go to school in person because hybrid is required to pass the class. But theres rumors that this dude (which i just so happen to have 3 classes with in person) might have the [virus]. Im kinda scared, knowing thereâ€™s gonna be stupid people who wont follow the rules are will ruin it all for us. Wish me luck
