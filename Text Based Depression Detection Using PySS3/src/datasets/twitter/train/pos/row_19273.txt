Should I take a shower before my swim meet? Or do I wait to take one after? Anyway, Iâ€™ve got a swim meet today, itâ€™s the first one of the year, &amp; Iâ€™m feeling pretty good about it.

I didnâ€™t take a shower last night, &amp; I feel like I should take one now. But I also feel like taking one before will make me feel weird &amp; slow down my swimming speed. Am I overthinking this?
