Any ideas? Recently, my graphics card in my pc failed and is no longer working, my Dad no longer has a job due to the pandemic, and Iâ€™m not old enough to get a job yet. We recently sold my switch, xbox, and laptop for money to help us but I got to keep one thing which I chose my pc. Do any of you have any ideas for a 14 year old to get money? Thank you.
