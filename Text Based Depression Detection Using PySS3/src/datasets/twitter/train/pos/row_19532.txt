Should I confront my brother? My brother (weâ€™ll call Nick) and step-sister (weâ€™ll call Lexi) have been getting along way too well lately (heâ€™s 14 and sheâ€™s 13). Like theyâ€™ve been glued together. I have reason to believe theyâ€™re attracted to each other. 

Should I open the conversation asking my brother, â€œyou and Lexi have been really getting along, huh?â€ 

And follow it with, â€œYou guys seem to really like each other. Was she in your room last night?â€ 

I feel disgusted with them. I havenâ€™t even spoke to them today. Iâ€™m even considering hinting at the idea to my dad with, â€œLexi and Nick have really been getting along lately.â€
