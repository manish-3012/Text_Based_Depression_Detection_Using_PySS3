Enlightening everyone here on what happened on r/wallstreetbets yesterday because you guys need to know. So pretty much thereâ€™s these investors in Wall Street (famous stock exchange) that are called Short sellers. So this entire situation has to do with gamestop.

So these short sellers saw that Gamestop stock prices might fall, which is good for them. Itâ€™s good because they borrow gamestop stock from people, then sell them, and when the price drops they buy back stock and effectively gain money.

So some degenerates at r/wallstreetbets saw this. Do you know what they did? Spammed the fuck out of gamestop stock making it increase by over 3000%. Now these short sellers who already sold stock got fucked in the ass because they had to buy back the stock they borrowed to return it to the lender, and since it was like 12$ when they bought it and 350$ now, say they borrow 300 stock, they lost multiple thousands of dollars.

Although r/wallstreetbets did this, multiple people bought stock early and kept it. Since the value of the gamestop stock then raised so drastically, many of them easily brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars, and made short sellers and entire corporations lose multiple billion dollars.

The people that got this money then were able to pay for their tuition, donate it, pay for their family memberâ€™s surgery, just great stuff.

All of that because these fucking idiots spammed the hell out of gamestop stock because they hated short sellers.

You love to see it.
