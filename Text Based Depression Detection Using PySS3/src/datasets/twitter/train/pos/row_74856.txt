Lol I need help Ok so my b-day is in like a week or 2 but we need to plan. I am having sushi for dinner but what should I have for dessert is the question. I donâ€™t want cake because sushi is quite rich (at least what I usually order) so I am open to all suggestions. Iâ€™ve considered cannoli, pie, ice cream, ice cream and pie, and I am stuck. Pls help
