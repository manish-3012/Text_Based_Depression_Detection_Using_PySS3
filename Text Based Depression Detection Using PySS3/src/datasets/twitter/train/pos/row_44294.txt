How do I know if a girl likes me? I really like this girl in my class! I think se is very pretty and also really nice. I really want to get to know her better and maybe get into a relationship. How do I know if she likes me too? She has a lot of friends and also quite a lot of male friends so that makes it hard for me to know if she likes me as a friend or not. I try to talk to her as much as I can, but sometimes Iâ€™m a bit shy. I think she talks more to me than other boys in my class. Sorry for this long message lol. Thanks in advance for your advice!
