Face washes are a sham I am breaking out for the first time ever, coincidentally after I used a face wash. I never use face wash, I just run my face under water and like scrub a bit with my hands. Brother leaves some fancy ass face wash stuff in da shower so I figure letâ€™s try this shit out. Now I have 5 pimples on my forehead.
