Why are kids so cruel to teachers? Something that has just kind of been on my mind,

&amp;#x200B;

Hey so with school beginning to start back up and people getting back into routines, people can be in bad moods and I get that. Nobody really likes school from the people that I've seen including myself. School is tedious, stressful, boring, and even depressing at times.

But the thing that I really want to say is that kids can be really rude or even cruel to teachers. I don't know if this is due to the fact of all the stress of school or just personal issues at home or emotionally. Regardless, I think we should be much nicer to teachers. They get paid a pretty crappy salary for the amount of work they do. 99% of teachers pour their heart and soul into their job and truly wish to do the best job they can to help each and every student even though it seems different at times. So many teachers are kind, loving, and compassionate people. My favorite teacher was having a student call them horrible names and cursing her out and I straight up went over and punched the hell out of him. So many teachers get so much hate and mean things each day for no reason. They have emotions to, and it can be really damaging to have your own students who you love a lot and work hard to help trash talk you. I wish people would just stop being so cruel to teachers.

Anyways, I'm interested to see what you guys think.
