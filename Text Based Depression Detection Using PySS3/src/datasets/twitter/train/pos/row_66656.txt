I've been a learning new form of communication Not Morris code. Tried that, and failed. 

One language that has been around for years, well they all have. I got this idea off of tik tok the forbidden land. 

I have learned from a short series of this guy who has a character name timmy and he speaks as If he is in midevil times. He speaks it so fluently it's like he knows it from birth.

Heres what I've learned, or have came up with, with the idea of it.

"The days past with thy non thoughts of you, my which one would darest not think of thee. Thy shall not refuse hand in partnership but rather peace." 

"I HAVE MET WITH HELLFIRE OF HADES AND SMELTED IRON WITH A TITANS TOUCH, I REQUIRE ASSISTANCE TO BRING ME BACK INTO THY BATTLE" 

"The gift of gratitude I give you in return of nothing more than a gift of thou respect." 

"ONWORD TO THY TEST WE SHALL RAIN VICTORIOIS IN THE HANDS OF THE GODS AND BE THE VICTOR NOT THY WITNESS, WE ONLT RETURN BACK TO THE HOMELAND WHEN OUR QUEST OF EDUCATION BE COMPLETED"

thann you for listening and no I'm not in theater I rather not be it's all for fun a games. "What did I read?" You read a kid being the weirdest I could be, have a nice day/night/afternoon.
