I might have destroyed a friendship So me and my friend have been friends since 7th grade and over the years I thought things were going fine but then I killed him in minecraft I was just messing around and killed him but he kicked me from the server and told a mutual friend that he was tired of me and he said he was in a bad mood after I killed him I don't know what to do as I've never really delt with anything like this before do I write an apology? Do I leave it alone? I know I should feel concerned about this but lately I've felt pretty empty emotionally and I don't really know what to do so could y'all please give me advice on this.
