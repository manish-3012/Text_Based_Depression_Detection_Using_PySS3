I am proud of myself for not being homophobic anymore.   

I know the title sounds very bad but that's the truth and I am ashamed of it. So a year ago from now, I was a 16 yo homophobic and transphobic person.  But at that time I started watching videos of foreign YouTubers and was introduced to Reddit and started reading stories from various subreddits and realised this is normal and I was the weirdo. So today as I was scrolling through Reddit I saw a post where OP said that when she married her wife a dog was the flower girl and it was very hard as it was illegal then. So I immediately googled why were dogs illegal at a wedding but I didn't get the answer and then it strikes me that homophobia was a thing. I was so proud of myself that I am not that homophobic person anymore.
