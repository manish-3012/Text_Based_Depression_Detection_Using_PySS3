Moral dilemma I've liked this girl for more than 4 years now and I've been dropping hints and making things obvious for a while now. Hell it was obvious that she liked me too in our earlier years. We're currently in our last year at my school and I still haven't made a move(despite everyone in our year knowing we both like each other). We're transferring later this year and I'm really in a tough spot. Our houses are also pretty far from each other so we can't interact much since the start of the pandemic though we always chat via messages. We're both very shy and can't intitate properly ( just earlier she was offline and I tried saying "I love you" knowing she won't see it and knowing I'd delete it the second it was sent, but it took me 30 fucking minutes thinking of reasons not to send it, and ultimately I sent and deleted it immediately). Anyway I really wanna express what I'm feeling but just can't do it, I'm ashamed as a man. If this goes on she'll probably move on thinking I'm not interested (I fear that this has already started). Anyway what the fuck am I going to do about this?!

I also apologize for adding too many unnecessary details. I'm high on euphoria because we just finished chatting a few minutes ago and my wee little brain just won't work properly.
