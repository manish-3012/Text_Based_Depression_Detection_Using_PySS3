I took a risk and it all worked out I took a risk last night by telling this guy I was interested it that I thought he was cute. It was terrifying, nerve-wracking, and I felt like throwing up. He calls me pretty back. My confidence goes up and I take the next step: I tell him to let me know if he would ever want to hang out.

14 hours pass. Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™s ghosting me. But then, he responds: For sure, Iâ€™ll let you know. How am I supposed to interpret that? Thereâ€™s so many meanings and of course I overthink it for hours and hours. But the ballâ€™s in his court now. Thereâ€™s nothing else I can do. I just decide to drop it and leave it be.

Then, a couple hours later he asks me the hang out this weekend.

My point: itâ€™s so so scary to be vulnerable, especially to people you like. Thereâ€™s fear of rejection, embarrassment, etc. 

But hereâ€™s the thing: if you take that leap two things will happen

1. If they say no, then you donâ€™t have to waste your time anymore. You can move on to better things.

2. If they say yes, then awesome! You have a cool story unfolding in front of you.

I know itâ€™s easy for me to say cause it worked out, but this is the first time in a long time. The same scenario actually occurred over the summer, and the other guy ended up ghosting me. NEVER GIVE UP YOUR TIME WILL COME.

This was the cheesiest thing Iâ€™ve ever written. Letâ€™s just hope this actually works out lol
