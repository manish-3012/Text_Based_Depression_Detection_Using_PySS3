I have a proposition Ok so in these times I'm sure all of us are struggling with school either online or in person. I think we all know that this isn't where the struggle in school started. This stress inducing mess of a school system has been around for forever. I want to find a way to change it. I want to start some sort of movement. The thing is, I dont know how people get these big movement rolling. If anyone has any advice or ideas drop it in the comments and let's start some change as a generation, and make history in a good way for once in these past 2 years. I felt this would be the most appropriate place to post this. I look forward to hearing everyone's ideas and opinions. And I wish everyone good luck for the rest of the school year. You all can get through this!

Edit: In reference to the American school system, and individual states within the US
