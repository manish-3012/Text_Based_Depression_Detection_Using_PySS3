Just went reddit free for a week! I went reddit free from 11AM Friday 8th of january to 11AM Friday 15th of january! 

It wasn't that bad for me(I used to be a discord user until my mother forced its removal) and I love to read. 

If you want to go reddit free, I'm advise you to delete the app or hide it for the time being, and also download long text guides on things you are interested in, since you need something to do in your free time. 

If you want to try it, GL! DM me for more tips
