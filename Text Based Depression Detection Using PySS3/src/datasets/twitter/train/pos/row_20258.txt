My personality is bad Iâ€™m probably on the right subreddit for this. And no, Iâ€™m not quirky and endearing, I have a bad personality. I try way too hard, I make fun of the people who try way too hard. I am very boring to talk to, I can give literal statements, flippant remarks or just absurdity to a conversation and that is it. Iâ€™m not funny but itâ€™s pretty much the only thing I can do in a conversation. I suppress five layers of narcissism every time I talk to someone and even then Iâ€™m still an asshole. I am also just bad at interpreting at what people are saying. Not very charismatic, pretty pathetic and I have little to no integrity. Way too lazy as well.

I have one friend. Theyâ€™ve been incredibly patient with me. For a while Iâ€™ve had no friends and I did not enjoy that. Now I have one, and that is nice. However, Iâ€™m terrified that Iâ€™m deteriorating whatever connection we have and that I will lose them.

I donâ€™t know what to do or even what to ask for help. So I might as well spew it out with all of the other mental cabbage on the subreddit like everyone else.
