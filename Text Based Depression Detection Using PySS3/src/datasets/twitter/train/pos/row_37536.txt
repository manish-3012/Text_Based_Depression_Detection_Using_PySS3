The amount of ignorance in this community baffles me  Yes, this is another â€˜racismâ€™ post. As a person who has experienced racism in one of its extremes, I have to say this- it is a humiliating experience, and most of the discourse I have seen here only trivialises it.

Racism is much deeper than simple prejudices. Calling names, exclusion from social groups, stereotyping, etc. can be racially charged, but is not always racist (in the sense of the word). These experiences can better be described under xenophobia. 

Racism has an active system that keeps one group of people below another in a hierarchy that divides them on the basis of their ethnicity. Racism, in its current form (which was perpetuated and institutionalised by â€˜whiteâ€™ colonial forces from Europe) often overlaps with colourism, where people with lighter skin tones and darker skin tones are at the top and the bottom of the hierarchy respectively. 

In a post- colonial world, racism means that the descendants of these marginalised groups carry the weight and the after effects of this hierarchy. For example, in USA, a system based heavily on racism and segregation has ensured the quality of life of certain racial groups to be far lower than of those who are at the top (namely, â€˜whiteâ€™ people). 

Racism has history. People who are often racially discriminated against are often deeply impacted by this history. It disrupts their daily life. It cripples their opportunities. It is something that they more often than not, cannot escape.

So, no- you canâ€™t be racist against 'white' people, especially if you are from a region where there have been historic cases of white supremacy. But you definitely can be prejudiced against them. ( Proper terminology is crucial because a lack of it trivialises the issue and slows down progress.)
