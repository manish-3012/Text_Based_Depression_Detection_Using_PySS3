I have no friends I've never felt as alone as I am now. I've always had someone I could talk to. 2-3 years ago I would come back from school and spend the rest of my day talking with my online friends on discord and playing games with them. It was enough for me to be happy. It was all alright until I met a girl that later become my girlfriend. It was my first real-life relationship that lasted about 4 months. Because of that I lost all my friends
