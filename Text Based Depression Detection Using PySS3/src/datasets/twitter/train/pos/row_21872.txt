I met a weird person online I was playing among us with randoms. Some guy called army said hi in chat. Pretty sure he named himself that way to attract the k-pop fangirls or something. I said hi back. We played a few rounds and chatted in the chat alot. Followed each other throughout the game. Then suddenly out of nowhere he/she just asked if we wanted to be friends. I said sure why not. Then he asked if I was a girl. I said no. Silence for a few moments. Then he left. It was kind of weird. Thanks for coming to my useless tedtalk.
