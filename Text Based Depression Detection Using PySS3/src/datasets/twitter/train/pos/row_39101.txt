Itâ€™s been a little over a week since my first day of school and Iâ€™m already sick Iâ€™m talking coughing, unable to unpop my ears so they hurt, mucus so bad I have to blow my nose every 2 seconds and I keep coughing it up, my lungs feel like thereâ€™s barbed wire coiling around it, every cough hurts hella bad, mega headache, hurts to talk, Iâ€™m extremely tired but canâ€™t fall asleep, my muscles hurt, last night I kept waking up every hour for no reason and it was miserable, and it hurts to swallow


Itâ€™s prolly a cold or summ but still pray for me yâ€™all ðŸ˜« lmao
