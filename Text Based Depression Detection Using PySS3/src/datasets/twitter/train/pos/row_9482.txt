Hola! Yo hablar InglÃ©s, y yo quiero tiene un conversacion en EspaÃ±ol. Hi! I am a native English speaker who has been taking Spanish for a couple years. I have really enjoyed it, but havenâ€™t gotten many oppurtunities to have a text conversation with anyone. So, can we turn this comment section into a Spanish chat? And while I know that I will most likely have gramatical errors, and say some things wrong, I am not looking for criticism. So, if I get something wrong, please donâ€™t tell me. Unless it is VERY wrong. I would like to speak with anyone who speaks any amount of Spanish. So yeah, just make the comments like a Spanish groupchat (with less slang, and more technical sentences) that anyone can join! Iâ€™ll start it! Thanks :)
