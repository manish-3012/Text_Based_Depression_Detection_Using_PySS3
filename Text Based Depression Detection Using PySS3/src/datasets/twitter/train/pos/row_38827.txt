How to deal with being a victim?  I'm in high school. Some jerk did something mean to me in the past by embarrassing me, which happened about 6-7 months ago. I confronted him about it and got him to apologize. Despite this, I still feel like a victim. Its because I know that only some people in this world are victims, and others are lucky enough to never get victimized in their entire life. All thx to that asshole, I now have the victim label. How do I move on being a victim?
