was having the worst night ever until she asked me out i hung out with a friend of a friend yesterday on a triple date with other friends. she was my plus one and we really clicked! iâ€™d never met her in person before so i was pretty nervous, but the second i saw her i was calm. sheâ€™s super cute and we have a lot in common!! we had a lot of fun

today, however, was very very tedious. i had a lot of meetings with my choir director to discuss how i would practice for upcoming competitions, and then i got super lightheaded and my allergies were super bad. *then* i got in a fight with my mom because i was moody do to my aforementioned shitty feelings. i ended up going on a long walk. during that walk i received a snap in which she asked me out, but i was so mad that i couldnâ€™t process it until now. iâ€™m super happy!! this is the first date with a girl iâ€™ve had since coming out as bi, and i hope itâ€™s a good one.

for all of my astrology people, iâ€™m an aquarius sun and sheâ€™s a pisces sun. feel free to educate me.
