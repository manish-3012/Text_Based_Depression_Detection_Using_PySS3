AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Iâ€™m a junior in high school and I still have no clue what job is even want. Like Iâ€™m not particularly good at anything and super bad with technology, communication, and staying motivated and there really isnâ€™t anything I enjoy doing.  Like what the fuck am I going to do with my life. I know Iâ€™m going to have to get a job but I doubt Iâ€™ll be anything more than unremarkable. Iâ€™m pretty much just going to be stuck existing doing mediocre on a stupid job till I die. Anyone one else out there waiting to die in an unfortunate event like a car crash or WWIII so that you can die without having to commit suicide before you even have to become an adult?
