I feel like crying. I don't know where to post this so, I'm posting this here.

I just feel like crying, for no reason. I was just minding my business when, my mom asked me something (that doesn't really matter to me anyway) and, I just... felt like it. I managed to go to my room without anyone noticing and... I'm just seating here now. Trying to get this out of me.

(Sorry if I did any grammatical mistakes)
