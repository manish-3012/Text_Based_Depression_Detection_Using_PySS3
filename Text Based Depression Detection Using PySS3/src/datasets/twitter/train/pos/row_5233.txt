iâ€™m pretty sure the californians moving to texas are disproportionately conservative texas isnâ€™t turning blue cuz californians are moving in, itâ€™s turning blue cuz texans are either turning blue, or voting 

if the texas legislature goes blue, and removes all the voter suppression, itâ€™ll probably stay blue 

also california really needs to be more business friendly so they donâ€™t all move to texas/Puerto Rico
