Here's what's going on in Texas for those who don't know There was a big snowstorm a couple days ago. Gas is something you have to pay for there, which they voted on (red state). republicans dont think gas should be provided by the government and because they voted against it, it isn't. It was a really bad snowstorm as a result of climate change (one of the worst in texas history, and they don't get much snow there).

So, some people can't afford the gas and the concern is they'll freeze to death in their own homes because they don't have gas. Gas isn't just heat either, their water isn't being treated by the state right now and stoves aren't working to cook. 

At least 25 people have died as of 24 hours ago. To give you an idea of it 3 kids died when they accidentally lit their house on fire trying to stay warm and a man was found frozen to death in his recliner.
