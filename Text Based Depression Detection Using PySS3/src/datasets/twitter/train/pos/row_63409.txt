Well, my downstairs neighbor just caused a fire. :( The downstairs neighbor left something on the stove then went out, locked all doors. Our other neighbors who are also his friend decided it was a good idea to break a window to get in, but we called 911 and kept everyone out. To be fair, it was inevitable that they would break something as there was no way to get inside. It was a big ordeal and like 2 firetrucks came with 20 people, took a little bit but it was under control. They used a super loud and powerful fan to blow out the smoke and did the same for us upstairs. My cat got super stress out, she ran outside, then back in when the flashing lights and sirens came but she's doing good now. All that remains now is the smell of burnt food, yuck.
