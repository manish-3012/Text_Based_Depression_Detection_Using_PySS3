Okay, so Iâ€™m planning my bfs b-day present, but Iâ€™m realizing my idea is pretty expensive so like I need some opinions before I go through with it lol So how would you feel if your gf made a lego version of your dream car? Would you like it or is this whole idea not worth it? (My bf is a big car guy)
