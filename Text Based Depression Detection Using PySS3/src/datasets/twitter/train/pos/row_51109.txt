I've built a giant dirt tower in the minecraft server It's quite close to spawn, so you can come and see it. It has quite a few floors, each one having a unique name and role. The tower isn't finished yet, I plan on making it even bigger. A group of people started building a town around with a few houses, a berry farm and some trees. I really had fun ! And the lag and constant disconnections made it even better !
