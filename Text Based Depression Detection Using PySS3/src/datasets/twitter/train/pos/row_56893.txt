I had a full conversation with my math teacher about leafyisHere A couple weeks ago my math class took a test on angles. I finished the test early and instead of doing other work I pulled out my journal and started to draw leafyisHere. My math teacher walked past my desk and asked why I wasnâ€™t doing my test. I told him that I finished early. He looked down at my journal and asked what I was drawing, so I opened up my laptop and showed him a photo of leafy. My math teacher asked who this person was and why they were â€˜famousâ€™. I decided to take it upon myself to teach my boomer math teacher who LeafyisHere is. 

I am glad to say that I taught a boomer about the online world instead of doing my math work.
