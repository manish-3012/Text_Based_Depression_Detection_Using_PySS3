Iâ€™ve come up with a plan When I go back to my school in September, if they say masks are option like other schools have said, the next day Iâ€™m walking to school in regular clothes and specifically a hoodie. If they tell me off Iâ€™m just going to say â€œIf masks are optional so is our uniformâ€
