Itâ€™s not worth it I have to admit. I sometimes look at the shotgun in the kitchen and stare at it, but I know itâ€™s not. 

Near Christmas time of last year, a kid in the grade above me never woke up. I never had the chance to really get to know him, but I remember the one time we played 9 golf holes together even though we both sucked. It was my favorite course, and getting to talk for like 1 hour was awesome. I still look back on it now. I see his younger brother some, but it only reminds me. 

Even though your situation might be tough, there is always someone who cares. Donâ€™t be scared to call the suicide prevention hotline, you are the one they made it for.
