Survey on school reopening Iâ€™m conducting this survey for my journalism class. Any responses are much appreciated.

1. I feel my schoolâ€™s response to the pandemic is appropriate (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, or strongly disagree)

2. I think my school should reopen at a regular time in the fall (y/n)

3. My school is responding by (no adjustments, remote learning only, in-person learning with adjustments, students can choose, or other)

4. On a scale of 1-5, how comfortable are you with remote learning? (1 being not comfortable at all, 5 being very comfortable)
