I have a tough choice to make could you help. So I just built a new pc and I have 2 options with my old one. I could either turn it into a minecraft server for 12 or give it to my little brother who dose not have a pc. All of my friends and people on me discord want me to make a minecraft server but my brother is begging me to give it to him. What should I do?
