New Years is pointless Can someone please tell me people call New Years a â€œfresh startâ€ like if you raped 5 people last year it doesnâ€™t go away, if your girlfriend/boyfriend cheated on you it doesnâ€™t go away in a new year. Especially a virus itâ€™s going to disappear overnight, I get that itâ€™s a new year and 2020 sucked but the fact that, Kobe, Grant imahara, and Chadwick died. But the fact that itâ€™s a new year doesnâ€™t mean it didnâ€™t happen it just means that it was last year.
