Very sad time Welp. Iâ€™ve been rejected twice by a girl I really like. Thatâ€™s on top of an already hard day, having to socialize with people I normally donâ€™t. 

The first time was when she was in a relationship (I didnâ€™t know at the time). Thatâ€™s my fault. But now, she just sent me a super long paragraph about this interaction with this one boy. 

Will I ever get a gf? Tune in next time to find out
