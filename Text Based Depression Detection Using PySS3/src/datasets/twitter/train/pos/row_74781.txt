Is my friend a narcissist or am I wrong? I really wish it hadn't come to this but it did so now let me tell you about her, first, what I think makes her a narcissist: she uses people for her own personal gain, she forces herself on other (not sexually, more social-wise), she thinks shes infallible, whenever I point put a fallacy in her arguments she starts ranting to other people and belittles me, she thinks she's a perfect little angel and a demon at the same time, she keeps switching around her ethnicity (or that may be my fault), she gas lights 

Shes 12, switches between bi, non-binary, gender fluid, pansexual, and some other that I cant recall, is this my fault or is she a narcissist? What can I do?
