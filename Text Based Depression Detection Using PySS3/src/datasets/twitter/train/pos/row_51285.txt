Iâ€™m starting a protest, whoâ€™s with me? The main cause behind this is the mistake known as the school system. Before you start commenting about how this is just one of those cringe â€œschool badâ€ posts, let me talk. 

All the schools do is constantly test students for how well they can remember useless information theyâ€™ll never use again, and completely ignore the basics, e.g. how to pay taxes, what a credit score is, how to apply for a loan, how to buy a car, and more stuff we need to know to survive when someone pulls the rug. 

The schools themselves are also set up like a prison system. Go to room A6 at seven, go to the cafeteria at twelve thirty, donâ€™t talk with your classmates, do these tasks by this time, you canâ€™t wear these clothes, and weâ€™re taking your freedom of speech. 

The U.S. Supreme Court has said that students â€œdo not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and expression at the schoolhouse gate.â€ This is on http://freedomforuminstitute.org and [here is a direct link](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/about/faq/what-rights-to-freedom-of-expression-do-students-have/) to where I got the beginning sentence on. 

If we want to see change then we need to make that change happen, and it takes more than one small group of people to do so. As the Atlantic says; â€œAs Michelle Rheeâ€™s group, StudentsFirst, declares: Americans can â€œwork together to fix this broken system.â€ All it takes is the courage to rip it apart.â€ I donâ€™t know about anyone else but I want to see a new system that doesnâ€™t take studentâ€™s sanity, so itâ€™s our responsibility to do something about it. 

Disclaimer!!! I claim no responsibility for anything you choose to do to yourself or what happens to you, if you joint the strike and something severe happens, itâ€™s on you.
