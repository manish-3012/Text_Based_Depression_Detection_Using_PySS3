8th graders are the meanest motherfuckers Iâ€™m 14 and going to a Jr. High and Iâ€™ve noticed that 8th graders (including myself) give no fucks about other people. Like, I was in science and for some reason our teacher decided that we needed to watch a video of Paralympic swimming. As the video goes on, chortles are coming from throughout the room and, I was managing to keep at least slightly under control until a guy with only hands, no arms comes on screen and I had to quickly suppress my laughter. For the rest of the video I managed to keep my composure until my friend said â€œYou may be an internationally known swimmer, but I can climb a ladderâ€ and I fucking lost it. What the fuck is wrong with 8th graders?
