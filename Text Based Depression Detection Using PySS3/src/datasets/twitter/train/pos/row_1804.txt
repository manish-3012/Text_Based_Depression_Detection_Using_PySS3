yâ€™ever feel like you canâ€™t do anything and lost all motivation let me vent for a sec

school sucks and i hate it. the only good part was friends and i had like two fun teachers but online fcked me over doggy style and now iâ€™m missing like thirty assignments because my motivation went ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§³ so iâ€™m failing like three classes and no matter how many times i turn on my computer and go to canvas to do my work, my brain just shuts down. itâ€™s not out of laziness (or at least thatâ€™s what i like to tell myself), itâ€™s just the last while iâ€™ve felt super empty about a bunch of stuff. i used to love playing my guitar but now if i try iâ€™ll get in one or two practices a month. i love(d) making art but everytime i open my program i lose my spark. i feel tired all the time and have no motivation for anything other than lying in bed and listening to music for hours. itâ€™s hard to take care of myself, itâ€™s hard to eat, itâ€™s hard to clean my room, itâ€™s hard get out of bed, iâ€™m basically just a walking corporal husk. 

so yeah iâ€™m not thriving please help whatâ€™s wrong with me lol
