Random shit have been going on So, I was doing my homework, and suddenly I received a DM on Instagram from a female cousin of a friend of mine. I didn't know who she was, but since I didn't want to look like an asshole, so I answered her. She said she wanted to know "boys from other countries" (she lives in PerÃ¹ and I'm in Italy), and so I keep texting with her since it would have been fun to meet a different culture and talk with a person distant thousands of km from me. 

Anyway, everything was going fine until this morning she wrote that she found me "handsome" and that she like me. 

She is the first girl that tells me something like this and I don't know what to do because I don't even know her and I don't like her as she likes me.

Please help
