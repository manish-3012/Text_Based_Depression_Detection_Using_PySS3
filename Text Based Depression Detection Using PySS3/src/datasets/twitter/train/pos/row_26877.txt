I (17M) was informed that my girlfriend (17F) had patched up with her ex (22M?) by her younger sister (15F).I don't know what to do.  I know this sub deals with more light hearted topics but I didn't know where to go especially as my post on RA gets removed.

So last July I started dating a girl. Not gonna go into details but she had an abusive relationship with her ex, nothing physical just verbal and emotional manipulation.

So, today her sister told me that she patched up with her ex. I don't feel angry I just feel disappointed. I would have preferred if I heard it from her. After all the things she was put through by him I just don't understand her reasoning. A part of me doesn't want to understand and a part of me knows they won't work out. She is just gonna hurt herself again and although its not my responsibility anymore, I guess I just feel pity. I guess it just feels weird, to care for someone and they subconsciously going back to someone who f\*cked with them on a regular basis not that while ago. She chose to go back to him and I am gonna end things but I just wanna know why. I know there are some psychological reasons as to why people who have been in ab\*sive relationships go back. I just want to know why she would do it? I can't think of any sound reason as to why she would go back.

Do I block her from all social medias and ghost her completely and risk not getting answers or should I confront her about the situation?

Also forgot to mention but the patching up happened around a week ago.

Any advice would be great, thank you for reading my post.
