Whatâ€™s going on So I have been okay for the past year and 11 months but as soon as it hit December i got a wave of loneliness and emptiness and I donâ€™t know what to do I feel like something is missing like a part of me just vanished with out anything happening no but moments to set it of it just happened I donâ€™t like it I hate it actually I donâ€™t want this whatâ€™s going on (I donâ€™t have depression I can be happy I just feel like something isnâ€™t their and it hit like a brick today more then ever)
