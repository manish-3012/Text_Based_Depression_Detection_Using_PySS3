I'm scared to fall in love I'm scared to fall in love. Im (16M) and I'm catching feelings for a girl. It scares the absolute shit out of me cause it's the first time I felt this way. I feel emotionally vulnerable, I feel as if I'm exposed and I hate it when things are out of my control; I hate that my happiness is in the palms of her hands. I hate these emotions of uncertainty or anxiety, always thinking about her, if she's talking to other guys, or if she likes me back. 

I've always felt as if life didn't matter too much, but feeling like this makes me aware of my life. As if it makes me value it more. It feels as if the things I do matter, that my life matters. My decisions hold weight, the way I act holds weight. I hate gambling my wellbeing for the slight chance that she likes me back and I find happiness. Just wanted to get things off my chest so I'm typing this to the internet. Sorry to bother everyone with my teenage problems. Thanks, Reddit!
