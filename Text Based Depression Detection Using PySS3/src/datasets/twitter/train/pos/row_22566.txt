i like making people feel special i used to walk my friends very friendly but a very composed chocolate lab.

every time i would take him out people always wanted to pet him. Now keep in mind he was always composed while on walks unless he was getting pets. but people didn't know that. so when a  person would ask to pet him i would say go ahead and cue the extremely happy change of Demeanour from the puppy. the person would also get happ\]y from his change of expression and i would just say "huh he normally doesn't act like that for strangers". now i know when someone says that to me about there animal companion i feel special, so i thought that other people would too. unfortunately, i was only able to walk him for a month before my friend wanted to take over again.
