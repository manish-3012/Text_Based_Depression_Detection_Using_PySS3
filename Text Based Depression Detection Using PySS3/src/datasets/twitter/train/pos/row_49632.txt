U know what kinda sucks A lot of girls I've met online liked me...today I posted some pics of myself here on reddit and only received nothing but compliments...so apparently I ain't ugly...but apparently not a single girl I've ever met irl agrees with that

How tf am I supposed to get a gf if every girl that likes me lives 1000s of miles away
