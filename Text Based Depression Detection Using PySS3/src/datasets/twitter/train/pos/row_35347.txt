Needing a bit of help choosing. Iâ€™ve saved up about R14,500 which in USD is around $1,000. I wanted to spend it on a gaming PC but my parents are pressuring me to save it and use it later to maybe go to Europe after I graduate and do something nice, I have every reason to get the PC... Which option do I choose?
