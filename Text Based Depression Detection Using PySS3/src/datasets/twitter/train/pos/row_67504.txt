Urgent: how do I convince my mum to let me stay here and go with her on vacation So basically my mum brought tickets to Benidorm in Spain and we leave tommorow. Now at first i was excited it was gonna he a family thing my aunt my 6 year old cousin and the other older Male cousin his friend and my uncle. It was gonna be all fun till..


He was gonna leave in 2 days. With my uncle and his friend aswell. We are gonna stay 8 days and I'm the anti social type I cant make new friends there the most i can really do is talk to My cousins friend

And I'm also not a fan of the beach I was just going there to stay with my cousin but it's all mainly been ruined 


So I'm gonna have to stay with 2 middle aged women and one little girl who yeah shes cute but shes 6 years old and can be very annoying and normally it was gonna be me my cousin my uncle and my cousins mate in one apartment whilst the Ladies stay in another 


So honestly I will 100% not have fun there because last time I went on such a "holiday it was the most boring annoying thing of my life.


Now I wanted to say this to my mum but she spent Â£400 and basically I cant just say that i dont wanna go cuz she spent so much and we arent the richest shes a disabled women and honestly I dont know what to do cuz its basically gonna her ruining my summer again and I really just wanna stay where I am rn 


Normally when she leaves the country it's easy to have someone here with me so Its not gonna be hard for me to stay and here I have my friends that I could invite
