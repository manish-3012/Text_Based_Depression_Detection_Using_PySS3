I need new group seriously okay so donâ€™t get me wrong the boys are good itâ€™s just that they donâ€™t do shit they are boring and they only play like once a month and when they do itâ€™s just fortnite so I donâ€™t join and Iâ€™m always just playing by myself or random people and even still it doesnâ€™t feel the same playing Cold War with randoms so I just virtually just practically play by myself defeating the purpose of even getting a mic to use and itâ€™s just difficult to even hang out at this point, and that concludes my rant
