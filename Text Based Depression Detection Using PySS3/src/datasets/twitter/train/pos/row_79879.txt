idk if it happens with anyone else so my dad and mom both are in army my mom is a doctor and she comes from the "good neighborhood." And my dad is a marine nd comes from the "bad neighborhood" and there is me who is forced to toughen up by my dad and has no pressure from my mom's side. and my dad doesn't know the real me he sees the lenient me and doesn't know the bad ass me.
