Day 36: Good Night school starts tomorrow. this is deafeningly anticipating. i can barely sleep. why did i have to start high school in a digital environment? nevertheless, i am vexed with anticipation. i need to finish my book, because i probably have to write an essay about it tomorrow. anyways, good night.

*hugs*
