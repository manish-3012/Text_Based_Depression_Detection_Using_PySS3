I wrote a song today felt it was pretty stupid but my friend keeps saying its pretty good so screw it I will try sharing hope y'all enjoy 
I have lost my way in time,
And I find myself looking for a way out,
And the voices in my head are cycling again,
And I feel like breaking,

But while i'm standing in the dark,
And listening to the voices in my head,
I know,
I am not ready to die,

I may feel like a empty shell,
And I may be empty headed,
But while I stand in the dark,
I am not ready to die,

I will not break,
I will keep the resolve,
I will continue to push,
I refuse to break,

And to be cast away in time,
I will make my name known,
I will not be forgotten,
I will make my name go down,

I will find something,
To etch my name into,
And to leave a mark on history,
Nothing will break me,

And after all my troubles,
And all my struggles,
I will stand against the dark,
And my resolve will be stronger then before,
