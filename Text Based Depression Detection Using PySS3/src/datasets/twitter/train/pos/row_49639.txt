Fun times I got called a communist at dinner for not being a conservative like my grandfather. Yeah I have some liberal values and yeah i have some conservative ones too. I dont say Trump 2020, and I dont say Biden 2020 either. I simply wanna be left alone about politics. At the end of the day though, I am considered mid left.
