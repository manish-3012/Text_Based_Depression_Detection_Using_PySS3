A useful trick in online schooling Tl;Dr:Cover your camera with something green use a photo or a GIF of yourself as the background

If you have lessons on Zoom or Teams(maybe in other places, i dunno) you can cover your computer camera with something green, and set a photo or better a GIF of yourself as the virtual background. If your teacher barely cares, or isn't paying that much attention, the photo will suffice. If your computer can handle GIFs, this is practically undetectable, even more so, if you have your mouth beneath the camera.
