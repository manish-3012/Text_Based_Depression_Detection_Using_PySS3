I want an older brother. Or just an older guy friend. I cannot stress how much I really want to have an older protective brother. Sadly, the universe didn't give me one. The second best option is an older guy friend (18-19). I don't know, I just don't have guy friends who are older. So umm... anyone wanna be an older guy friend?
