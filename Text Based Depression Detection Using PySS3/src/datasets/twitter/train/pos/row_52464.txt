You need to hear this, and I need to say it I thought that, many years ago, I grew up. That I stopped being a bigoted little 12 year old and matured. I thought I had realised how much hate speech and slurs could hurt someone, but I was wrong. Far too recently, I have said terrible, disgraceful things and now I've found out those things I said hurt one of my closest friends. I was told a lie about hate speech and free speech, told that it was our right to say what we wanted. Now I want to warn any of you who believe the same lies, hate speech is not free speech. We cannot go around in ignorance of ourselves, believing we are right and just. We all need to look at ourselves, make sure we are completely certain about what we believe and think.
