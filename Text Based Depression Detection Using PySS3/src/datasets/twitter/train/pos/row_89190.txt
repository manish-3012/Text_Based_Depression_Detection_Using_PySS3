I hate myself for being such a failure Apologies if there are some typos, Iâ€™m shaking right now.

For my entkre life, Iâ€™ve been a straight A student in advanced classes and I even advanced a grade. Last year my grades slipped a bit and I felt like a failure, but now I have 101 missing assignments, four Fâ€™s and my highest grade is a C+ and I hate myself so much for it. I donâ€™t even know how I got to this point. Iâ€™m pulling an all-nighter tonight to get my graces up but I hate myself fo much for getting to this point. How did I even do it? If I told my younger self I wpild be like this right now, they would be disgusted and Iâ€™m disgusted too. Because my grades slipped a little bit last hear, Iâ€™m in regular math instead of advanced math yet Iâ€™m still failing all because Iâ€™m a lazy fuck. And I want to take AP classes nect year (Iâ€™m in 8th grafe) because Iâ€™ll feel like a stupid failure if I donâ€™t but I know my teachers are going to think Iâ€™m an idiot and i dont know if I can do it i f Iâ€™m really this lazy. Iâ€™m going to get my grades now up but Iâ€™m so disappointed in myself for getting to this point and making eccuses and Iâ€™ll never be able to change the past.
