How does one boyfriend? How does one boyfriend?

So I (15M) recently asked out a girl and she said yes. Weâ€™ve been on two dates and those have been really great but outside of that, recently she hasnâ€™t been talking with me much, either in person or by text. All I want is to spend more time with her and for her to want to spend more time with me. Friends have told me that she needs more time to adjust but itâ€™s been a few weeks and Iâ€™m not sure how much more waiting I can deal with before I get really sad and feel devalued and useless. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
