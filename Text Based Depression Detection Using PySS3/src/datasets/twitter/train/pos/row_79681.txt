I have gamed I played Minecraft with Nyan Cat on loop for the last few hours with friends. They don't seem to understand the true beauty of Nyan Cat, it is an acquired taste it seems. This gaming session has come at a cost though, I am now covered in copious amounts of sweat. My hands drenched and skin wrinkled. My asscheeks be moist and slippery, particularly in the hot steamy area between the 2 thicc mounds of flesh. The asscheeks in question I will now describe in more detail: they're thicc, but not so thicc that they can clap. I envy people with clappable asscheeks. I fear that mould may have grown around my body. Thank you for listening.
