why are there so many songs about rainbows

and what's on the other side

rainbows are visions

but only illusions

and rainbows have nothing to hide

so we've been told

and some choose to believe it

I know they're wrong

wait and see

someday we'll find it

the rainbow connection

the lovers

the dreamers

and meeeee
