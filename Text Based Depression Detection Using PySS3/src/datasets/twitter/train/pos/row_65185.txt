Im lost (emotionally and mentally) I highly doubt anyone can help me here but rather just want to see how many people relate or think like me. 
You see when i mean by lost i mean i have no clue what to do or what im suppose to do. Nothing i do is fulfilling and ive basically become an emotionless thing that jist walks and talks. I have 2 more years of highschool left and i still dont have my shit together like the rest of my classmates my grades are good enough to allow me take most walks of life whether it be a trade or profession like programmer (hopefullythey stay good for junior and senior year). But with these countless options to take im at a loss. So who else is lost or found life a little bit empty.
