ONLINE SCHOOL JUST MAKES ME WANNA GO AND YELL AT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING Yeah, I literally feel like just walking to my balcony and start yelling as loud as I can! The amount of work they gave us to make up for inconvenient studies is just literally impossible man.

With my school, we pick up some work modules that they give us on Saturdays. Then we have online school each day from 7.30 to 3.30. Imagine if you will, getting 4 pages of an assignment for a single subject(I have 8), then the teacher decides that she wants to add an essay and a presentation to that list! And the best thing of all, all these works have to be written by hand! I know some of you guys have it worse but I just literally can't man, I just can't take it.

I reallyy wanna cry right now T_T
