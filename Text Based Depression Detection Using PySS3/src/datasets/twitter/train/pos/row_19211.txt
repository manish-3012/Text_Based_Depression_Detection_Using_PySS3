School was interesting today Someone emailed a bomb threat in our school so we were taken out of class at like 11:40 for the whole day. We werenâ€™t told the reason why until like 2:50. I feel bad for the HSC students who had to have been taken out of their test. (Sydney schools bomb threat is the search term to use if you want proof) How was your day?
