I made a terrible fucking mistake! Yesterday afternoon, my dad bought me some jalapeÃ±os and habaneros to make some salsa with. I instantly got to work, never thinking to put any gloves on. When I was done, I put the salsa in the refrigerator, washed my hands and ate dinner. 


The second dinner was over, my parents and I got the salsa out and ate it with chips while watching a movie. It was really good. The floral taste of the habaneros really complimented the onions and vegetal flavor of the jalapeÃ±os. The three of us watched three movies before it got dark and my dad left (my parents are separated, but still great friends). 


Not taking any chances, I washed my hands after I was done eating the salsa. About an hour later, my mom took a nap. I thought, "Hey, I got a house to myself pretty much. Now's a good time to jerk it." I went to the bathroom, pulled up a sweet vid on PornHub with Malena Morgan and Mia Malkova and went to town. Despite handling the peppers hours before this and washing my hands twice, I still felt an INTENSE burn halfway through. 


I cried on the toilet for a few minutes before crawling to the couch in the living room and getting into a fetal position, clutching my junk which reduced the burn for some reason. After a few minutes, my mom woke up and asked me what was wrong, so I had to confess. She told me where the aloe was and started laughing once she knew I was better. 

The moral of the story is to never masturbate on the same day you've handled hot peppers. 


TLDR: I handled hot peppers without gloves, washed my hands and jerked off hours later, but still burned myself.
