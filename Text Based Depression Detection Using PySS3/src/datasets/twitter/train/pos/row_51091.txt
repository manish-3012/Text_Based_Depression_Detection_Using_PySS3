Private NSFW question for boys. I tried asking on a throwaway but this sub has a karma and age threshold so I thought itâ€™d be too much trouble. [NSFW question] Unable to ejaculate while masturbating.

Hello. I am 16 years old and have been unable to ejaculate. I have never even seen it before. I am hesitant to watch porn for several personal reasons but have tried it. Iâ€™ve even tried rule 34. I also have a short attention span which doesnâ€™t help, as not even pornography can hold my attention. I have tried using lubricant but it does not work. I have tried in the shower, too. Sometimes my penis will even hurt after doing it. Iâ€™ve tried pushing really hard but all it does is produce urine. I have began to lose hope and have started my will to do it. Everyone treats it as some amazing thing and the beginning feels good but I have been unable to get past edging. The tingling sensation I feel is too intense as it only causes me to voluntarily stop but also causes me to reflexively stop. Iâ€™ve only started this a few months ago which is embarrassingly late  and apparently is very unhealthy. I just feel left out, although I doubt my one year younger brother has begun either. Can someone help me please?
