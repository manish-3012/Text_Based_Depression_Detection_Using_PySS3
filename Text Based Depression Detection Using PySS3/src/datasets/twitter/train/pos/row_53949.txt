You are not ugly Hello. It's me again. So, I've been seeing a lot of memes about people calling themselves ugly. And I've also seen some posts here on this subreddit about you guys calling yourselves ugly. You are not ugly. Let me say this one more time, You Are Not Ugly. 
You are a wonderful and beautiful human being. Don't let others bring you down on what they say to you. Everyone looks different and that won't change a thing. You are not ugly. You are beautiful inside and outside. I hope this changes something about how you guys look at yourselves. Just know that you are not ugly. You are beautiful. If you are reading this, thank you for spending your time here and have a good rest of your day/night. Love you lots â¤. And stay safe with all this crazy COVID crap.
