I have had 5 math teachers this year I will only be using the first letter of their name for privacy.

1 - Mr T, I liked him he was an alright teacher and good at teaching math as well.
2 - Miss W, personally my favourite nice to be around and made math fun.
3 - Miss ?, I don't remember her name but, was mediocre at her job would be the be at description she COULD teach which is better then the person on this list.
4 - Mr H, he had an alright personality but was a SHITE teacher he would dance harder then a ballerina around questions when I asked him, he couldn't explain anything  and I didn't like him very much 
5 - Mr ? - he's been teaching us for a week now and he's funny entertaining, and can actaully fucking teach
