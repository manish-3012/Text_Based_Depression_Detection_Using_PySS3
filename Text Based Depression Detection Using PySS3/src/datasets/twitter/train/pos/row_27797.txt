I'm about to snap I don't understand why some people feel the need to be mean like this.

I posted a video on a subreddit about a guy I found funny. Then, another guy wrote "I wish I could downvote this 5 more times".

I'm about to start an argument. I'm about to write this guy a little letter. I'm pissed. Should I just give in? I would just defend myself because this is annoying me.
