How do you know when the right time is to ask out a girl? And if so how should you do it? Right, so as you may of guessed Iâ€™ve been chatting with one for about 8 months and Iâ€™m fairly sure she has a crush on me and obviously I have a crush on her. I just need some help with asking her out. Please and thank you
