lmao I remember like towards the end of last year, this dude I met and became friends w from here formed an obsessive crush on me and like even tho I didnâ€™t reciprocate, he would constantly bring up that he didnâ€™t know why he liked me bc Iâ€™m not his type 

like homie, I never even liked you like that why you gonna make every conversation we have about you liking me tf you weirdo 

if u like someone, donâ€™t make every convo about that specifically. be a normal person please ðŸ‘
