Ok Iâ€™m actually tired of the disrespect towards men, saying that weâ€™re so privileged and we wouldnâ€™t live a day like a woman First of all, stop saying privilege this, that itâ€™s annoying, people wanna end sexism but keep diving up into genders, like not everyone in a gender is gonna be privileged, itâ€™s annoying because a lot of people that complain about male privilege stay at home all day, probably just watch Netflix and do school work then complain that men wouldnâ€™t last a day in their shoes. Just because some people that happen to be your gender have a hard time doesnâ€™t mean mean all girls do. Itâ€™s annoying because women use this excuse to say â€œkill all menâ€ personally I donâ€™t care what they say but the reason is because â€œmen arenâ€™t actually being killedâ€, men have a higher chance of dying by suicide and homocide, so thatâ€™s kinda bs, Iâ€™m not trying to make it a competition but still.

Another quote Iâ€™ve heard â€œmen never fought for their rightsâ€, if you say this you are mentally challenged, bro revolutionary war, world war 1, world war 2 Vietnam, we werenâ€™t fighting for men rights we were fighting for the rights of everyone in America, so stop the disrespect.itâ€™s men and women but mostly men in the military that are giving up their lives all throughout history just for you to say dumb stuff like this. 

Iâ€™m gonna be honest the way I see women going crazy when a man makes a joke, is ridiculous. Like you know offensive jokes arenâ€™t female exclusive right? Trust me if youâ€™re a guy people will make those same jokes to you every day, like this is why itâ€™s just annoying when I see girls cry over a sexist joke, like bro the things I see you guys complaining about like dishwashers jokes etc are nothing, online or irl, I can confidently say boys definitely make fun of each other war more, and way worse, Iâ€™m not trying to genderlize all girls because itâ€™s only the sensitive ones but if I acted like some of you guys getting mad and crying over jokes as a guy, Iâ€™m getting bullied everyday. Some girls are so soft, and they think being a guys easy, Iâ€™m not trying to turn this into a gender war but if you find yourself crying over internet jokes and say being a guy is easy your dumb.I can speak for all guys when I say if I was as sweet and sensitive as some of yâ€™all Iâ€™m getting bullied, like you will literally get bullied just for being a nice person that doesnâ€™t do anything wrong.

Iâ€™m not tryna sound sexist but so many of you girls complain, and then do the stuff you complain about like sexist jokes at men, like kill all men, itâ€™s not even the joke that bothers me, itâ€™s the fact that itâ€™s so hypocritical
