Idk... just me rambling about my day It was pretty noice today... I woke up, played some hades then went to school AANNDD at school I got in talked a bit then nothing much until recess where I broke my nail and bleed a lot but it was good cause I poured water on it and then applied pressure by using a bandage and the pain went away within a half hour... BUT WHERE THE REAL JUICE is, is when I had history class AANNDD i talked to a friend I Hadenâ€™t talked to/had a REAL good conversation with her in awhile and it was super fun and yah... then I got home and played a bit of lethal league and did a bit of homework AANNDD now youâ€™ll all caught up...
