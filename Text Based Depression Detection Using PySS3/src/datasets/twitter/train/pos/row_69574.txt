Oh man I have a story So Iâ€™m playing a game called The Long Drive and I KNEW there were UFOS in the game cause i saw one pass by my head when I was getting ready to get back on the road. Iâ€™ve been driving for awhile now and itâ€™s dark, I canâ€™t sleep yet so leave the car idling and the headlights on with music playing and suddenly the engine and the headlights and the radio cut out. I try to start it again and it doesnâ€™t turn on. No dash lights, nothing. Then I see I teal looking light on the ground along with a humming sound (I have built in subwoofers) and I look up and itâ€™s the goddamn ufo. It scared the hell out of me so I quickly Pressed alt f4. I wish I hadnâ€™t cause I could have recorded the last 30 sec, I launch the game again and check the auto save records and they havenâ€™t saved since I had gotten out of the car last which was at an abandoned gas station.  Oh man the freaked me out I couldnâ€™t breathe it was terrible. Have you had game experiences like this?
