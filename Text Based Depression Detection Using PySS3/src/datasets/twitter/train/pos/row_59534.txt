Advice for every person on this subreddit. I (16M) used to really care about what people thought of me, and I had very few friends. the friends I had were rednecks (rural Ontario go brrt). Henceforth I had become a wannabe redneck/hick. I followed many many instagram pages that posted about Donald trump, far right political opinions, and diesel trucks, as well as other American political pages even though I'm Canadian. Me now 4 years later am more true to myself. I have my own friends who like me for myself. I'm a weeb, I love heavy metal, I no longer dislike the lgbtq+ just because my crowd disliked them and I am not racist anymore. From I just said your probably thinking wow this kid was probably a dick. Your right lmao. But that aside, if there's one thing  this whole experience taught me, it's that nothing feels better than being yourself. I found new friends, who share my interests. So if your struggling right now because you feel like you can't be yourself, lemme tell you right now, there is someone for everyone in this world, no matter who you are or what you like, everyone can make friends in this world. Who are we to judge each other? All we can do is our best. This sub has helped me vent in the past and I've laughed and cried in it, so if you want, hit me up and start a conversation. Thank you for reading this much if you got here, sorry this was so long.

Tldr: Don't change yourself just to fit in, everyones got a crowd somewhere.
