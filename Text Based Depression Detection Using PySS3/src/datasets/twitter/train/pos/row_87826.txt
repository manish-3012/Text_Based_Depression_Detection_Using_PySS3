Please help me. I was diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression from my doctor. But havenâ€™t gotten medications yet because there are so many other people that have similar issues, whom are being taken care of before me. I see a therapist on the 18th and should get medications then, but so far, nothing. And in 8th grade, Iâ€™m taking Algebra 1, and Iâ€™m about to fail. I have a D+ (68%) and a unit exam that will determine if I drop out and go to 8th grade math. I study hard a lot but with no results because I canâ€™t remember much. If I were to fail the exam, what would that mean for my future in education. Would it mess up my middle school graduation, highschool diploma, college? Iâ€™m very scared and having a breakdown right now and I donâ€™t know any answers. Thank you for reading this
