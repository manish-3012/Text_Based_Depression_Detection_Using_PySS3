I woke up and a bot had mentioned one of my alts in a porn sub and the post was a link to a service that is for hookups. Curiously I clicked the link and it seemed pretty sketchy but I went through the sign up steps anyway. I got to the end and they wanted my credit card info but I don't have one so I just exited the thing. 

Do I have a virus now?
