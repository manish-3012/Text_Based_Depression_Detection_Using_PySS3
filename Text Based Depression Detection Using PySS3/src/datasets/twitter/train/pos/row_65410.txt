I just had the most awkward class ever Since it was my last day of school before the HSC starts my visual arts teacher decided to throw a tea party. My only friend in that class didnt show up because he never shows up on the last day of school and the other people there were 3 girls and for the entire time I couldn't relate to the conversation at all so for the entire time I was sitting there sipping my tea listening to a conversation about makeup and stuff like that for about an hour and a half.
