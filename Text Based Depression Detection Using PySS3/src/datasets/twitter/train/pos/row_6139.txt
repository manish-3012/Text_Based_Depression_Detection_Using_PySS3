Hey! Are you up for the challenge of matching up to find a friendðŸ‘¥ based on 28 questions? Covers age, gender, interests (this be the real ðŸŒŸ), continent ðŸ—ºï¸ , willingness to share pictures ðŸ“· or voice calls ðŸ“ž, studying/working status and more ðŸš€! Hello and behold, prepare for a longish post xD ! 2020 was an intense and lonely year for many of us, which is one of the main reasons my friend /u/finder_of_the_humans/ spent 8+ months on a friend finding project that uses 28 questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with. It's the coolest project I've come across in a while (hence my posts). Please note you need to be 16 or older!

**How it works:**

**Step 1. Find compatible matches**

Basically it matches people up based on answers to 28 simple questions. You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to. This is your compatible matches list.

**Step 2. Friend requests**

Once you have the list, you can then send out **friend requests** to these users, (or **receive requests** from them), and once either of you have **accepted a request, you get connected with that person**, you form a friendship.  You eventually meet up, get married, 3 years later you ***get divorced and fight*** over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved.

**Why this is awesome:**

* Reach! Over 4000 people have joined, which means most people get 20-40 matches - people active in the past two weeks. If you're very picky (or a general outliner) you could expect a bit less.
* Time! It'll save you a bunch of time!  Imagine how long it'd take you to message 4000 people individually.

**What are the questions:**

* more about you
* age (you have to be 16 or older!)
* best part of your day
* gender
* sexuality
* interests (we have a HUGE list to pick from - all the way from lockpicking, to biotechnology, to minecraft)
* geographical continent
* how often you'd like to communicate with a friend
* type of friendship
* whether you'd be willing to share pictures
* whether you'd be willing to have voice calls
* religious
* working
* studying
* video games / books / drinking / smoking / drugs
* whether you want to hide/not match with 'low effort profiles'.

**Sounds sketchy, or you have concerns?**

A few people have concerns about the above. So I can highlight a few things. (1) You can be completely anonymous if you choose  (and probably should be anyway) - just use throwaway contact info. (2) There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well.  (3) And lastly you can read through everyone's feedback in previous posts from a while back here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/finder\_of\_the\_humans/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/finder_of_the_humans/posts/) as well as mine.

**Okay woohoo lets do this!**

This is an example of the UI  for a "match": [https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES](https://imgur.com/a/Dfqp6ES)If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them! (I'm based in Europe, so might be sleeping in US time).

**Final tips:**

I'd encourage you not be shy to send requests to people (that is the point!) - quite a few people sign up and don't send out any requests. People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them, so it's safe to assume that if you see their profile - they're probably still looking for a friend.

Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently.**Extra info:**

* You can be completely anonymous if you prefer, you would need a 'disposable/throwaway' method of contact.
* Most people get around 20-40 active matches. If you get less, make sure you have filled out the form correctly!  If you include people who haven't been active in 2 weeks it's - 200+
* You can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period.
* Email notifications about requests/friends get sent out every 30 minutes, though not everyone added an email.
* Matches are done instantly! But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests.
* This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising. **We're looking for help if you want to help**, and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way.
