Clarity on what supporting LGBT+ actually means Hello from your socialn't gay teen. I recently saw some stuff (a lot of stuff and for a long time) and think it needs clarifying for other people's own good. 

Users are commonly describing how they don't hate LGBT+ people but they don't support them. Support doesn't (necessarily) mean attending pride parades or anything super visible. What it means is that you respect people's existence, treat them the way they want to be treated, and that you don't support LGBT+ phobias. If you dislike homophobia, that's support towards LGBT+ people and it makes a bigger difference than you think. 

Support really just means that you can be a friend to people, whether they're cisgender heterosexual or not. Other good stuff is considered support but isn't quite as important. 

Supporting LGBT+ people is essential. I hope that's not up for debate. 



PS, I understand that not all LGBT+ people are actually nice people, and it's okay not to like someone as long as it's not because of who they are.
