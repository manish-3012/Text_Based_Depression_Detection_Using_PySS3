You should text the big bro/sis of your group, let them know you care about them. I'll always listen to others and try to help where I can, but everyone is too busy to listen to my problems or even check on me. My own family doesn't even listen when I wanna talk about how I'm feeling. Friends don't really care it seems... 

I lost my self when I tried to please everyone around me. It hurts to know I just act how people like best...
