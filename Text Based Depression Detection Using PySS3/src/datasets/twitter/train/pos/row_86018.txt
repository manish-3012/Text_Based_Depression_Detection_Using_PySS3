What's the point anymore I don't get it anymore, what happened to being a kid? Happy and having fun everyday? What's the world come to? KAM, RAW, gender wars, racism, oppression. I don't get the point of any of it. All I want to do is stay inside now, when I was 10-11 I was living the dream, now all that happens is people are scared of me either because I'm a man or a teen, I give up, why? I'm expected to do everything by society, do well in school whilst having a happy life and keeping others happy, I'm sick of this shit. I don't know what to do anymore.
