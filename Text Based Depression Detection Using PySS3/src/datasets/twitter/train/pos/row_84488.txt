I FOUND THE ULTIMATE WAY TO ASK SOMEONE OUT Here's how you ask a person out step by step:

1. Ask them out through messenger

2. Turn Wi-Fi off

3. Send something like "sorry wrong person lol". Because of lack of internet connection they won't see this yet.

4. Wait a couple of minutes and Turn Wi-Fi on. That will send the earlier messege and show it still over their response.

If you succeded remove that message, and if not, just keep it and let bad connection be your excuse.

Oh, and I should probably mention that i haven't tested this in practice, so be careful.
