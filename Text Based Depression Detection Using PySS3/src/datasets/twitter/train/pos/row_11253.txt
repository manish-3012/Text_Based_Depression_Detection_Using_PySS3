I just found a horrifying website and I want to report it but don't know how I don't if anyone will read this but I need some help
This is not related to me but to a website that I found on Google 
So I just watched this tik tok which had a song presumably from the 90s
I thought it was catchy and decided to look it up on google
I couldn't find the song but in the top5 results there was a porn website, which looked pretty much like any other porn website in the Google results, I just thought that there must be some kind of genre in relation to the song lyrics and for some reason my curious brain decided to browse through 
It pains me to say this but the website was filled with people(mostly women) having sexual intercourse with dogs, horses and animals of the sort
And therefore for obvious reasons I won't be disclosing the name of the song and the site 
What I require now is a way to report this website so that it gets taken down
Note that I did not have to go through a lot of stuff to reach this site, it was right there in the top 5 results
And I really don't want anyone else to see what I did
Also, a recommendation for bleach that is safe for the eyes will be appreciated

TL,DR: I found an easily accessible website filled with animals getting sexually abused and want to report it but don't know how
