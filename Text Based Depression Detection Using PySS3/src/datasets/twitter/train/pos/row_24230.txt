Great news! I began customizing greeting cards with original created mandala designs and photoshopped pictures as commissions! And I sold my first order! Yes!
I am so happy to be honest folks!

I didn't earn much but it was my first commission of a wedding anniversary greeting card and it was a bunch of happiness that I recieved!
