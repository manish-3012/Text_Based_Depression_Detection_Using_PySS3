Do HS girls really like older guys? Will you actually date one or just admire? If its some teen heartthrob like Harry Styles that makes sense but I don't know about your typical 20-30 year old guy. Some girls seem totally into it and others its a no no matter the age. Just wondering how common it is and what people think.
