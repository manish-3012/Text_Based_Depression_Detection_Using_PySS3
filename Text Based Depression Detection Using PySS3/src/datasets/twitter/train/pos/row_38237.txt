Are MacBooks ACTUALLY a good value? Recently my mother and I decided I needed a new laptop for school. We have a budget of around $800, and I suggested we get a lower end windows gaming laptop so I can be efficient in school, I can game on-the-go, and I like their systems more. but she insisted a MacBook air would be better because it quote "is a powerhouse and outperforms all other devices in that price range". I tried to inform her that MacBooks aren't exactly value machines and that you'd pay 2-3x the amount for a MacBook that was on par with a $800 gaming laptop. She insisted that MacBooks have always been the kings of performance and every Mac she has gotten was faster than a Windows machine (the last time she purchased a MacBook was in 2008) and that I needed to do my research before i chose a device. This infuriated me as I feel like I know for a fact that MacBooks aren't good for gaming (especially the MacBook airs) and that I'd be better off with a Windows laptop because it's not only faster but my preferred system. She then ridiculed me on how I was ungrateful and should just be happy she was willing to get me a computer. I have no clue why shes like this- why can't I just get a computer I'd like more for no extra cost? She always has to be right and it's so annoying. So I guess I'm asking two questions here, is she right? and am I a asshole?
