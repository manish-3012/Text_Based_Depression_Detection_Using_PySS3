Dug a hole and it filling with water I think i just ruined the rest of my life by doing absolutely nothing... I cant even remember how tf i got like this. I cant concentrate at school and now with online classes i have even more distractions. I really feel like smuthering myself rn. Over last week or 2 I've been feeling way more sad than normal and my grades are worse than a dumpster fire filled with horse shit. Idk. (I have 12 points short and i need 2 so yeah) I've lost motivation in my hobbys and just feel that im bad at it and that everyone is secretly laughing in their head about me. But when i tell my self not to think that i still do it. I feel like i have no future plan on wtf im going to do with my life and i have 2 years left of highschool (Probably a min of 3)
