I'm a Highschool Freshman during COVID and I'm terrified My grades are awful, I'll probably have to retake a grade. Honestly I don't know if it's life ruining but it's definitely embarrassing seeing all my friends thrive while I just fall harder and harder. I've practically failed the semester because of my inability to work under pressure and I don't know what to do. Everyone else I know failing is probably thinking "They can't fail us all right?" Well, they can, and probably will. I think so far ahead into the future of what I want to do and what I want to achieve but the thought of having to retake a grade makes it seem so far away, impossible even. But hey, welcome to the club I suppose, I ain't too special.
