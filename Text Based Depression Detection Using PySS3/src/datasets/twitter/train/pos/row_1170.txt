A Substitute Teacher's View on False Accusations First off, I'm 27, so I'm definitely outside the intended audience here, but a thread from this sub came up on /r/all of someone very upset that their favorite teacher and mentor was getting fired unfairly. I wanted to chime in with some thoughts from my perspective as someone who's had the pleasure of substitute teaching over the course of a couple years in a bunch of different schools in California. 

I've certainly encountered students behaving extremely inappropriately, and I've even had a troubled student or two joke about reporting me for things they made up. It is, on a personal level, really icky and kinda scary, but you put on your blank face, remind them to focus on that math problem, and move on. Educators have a lot on their side. Often too much so. Staff is pretty fundamentally almost always going to side with teachers over students. It is not easy at all to get a teacher fired, or even to get a school to stop bringing in a particularly bad substitute. Furthermore, educators have it drilled into them how to behave appropriately with students, which includes keeping things public and keeping contact with students outside of school limited and professional. This is for the safety and wellbeing of everyone, and as long as a teacher is following standard practices and not straying off the path, it's very unlikely for any sort of false accusations to get them fired. 

If a teacher is getting fired, there's probably really strong evidence of utterly unacceptable behavior, and it's also likely a pattern of behavior. Anything less, and the default attitude of many people is that the person saying something is lying.  


In any case where the facts are in doubt, well, schools have a lot of reasons to prefer sweeping things under the rug. A fired teacher is a big deal, it makes waves. A broken hearted or troubled student being lectured to stop lying, just being ignored or patronized, or being sent off to a different school is all sadly normal. If a school is actually taking action on students' reports of harassment, there's probably a lot more to it than you might think, or than what you really have a right to know about.   


I get feeling defensive of favorite teachers. I can tell you that teachers appreciate it. But that feeling is from your experience with that teacher, and other students have their own experiences. Just as you show different sides of yourself with different people, that teacher may behave very differently with someone else. If they did do something horribly wrong to someone else, well if history class teaches anything it's meant to be that people are complicated and that even national heroes can also do monstrous things. Part of growing up is coming to terms with those things and not letting them make you suspect the worst of people.  


Speaking of which, do cabals of students conspire to fabricate evidence and successfully get teachers fired for funsies? I expect it's happened. Cabals of students have literally murdered people. But it is not **normal**. It is in fact very **rare**. If a teacher is fired at your school (for non-budget reasons), however great they were to you, they very likely stepped way out of line with someone else. And if they did that with one kid, they probably did it with others who didn't say anything.   


As serious as false accusations are, and they should never be made, real abuse is far more serious in the harm that it does. Please don't rush to judgement, especially not of your peers. It's okay to not have a strong opinion on something you've heard about second hand.   


If you have experienced someone behaving inappropriately towards you, please tell an adult that you trust, and/or take a leap of faith on someone who works for your school. All education staff are mandated reporters and you **will** find someone who will be on your side if you open up.
