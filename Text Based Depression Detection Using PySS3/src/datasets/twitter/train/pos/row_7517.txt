The holodomer is real, and people need to know about it The holodomer was a mass ukrainian genocide caused by the soviet union. What basically happened was during Stalin's rule, Ukraine was facing a horrendous famine, which would cause them to go under their food quota. Fearing Stalin's wrath, soviet officials forced Ukraine to give up their food in order to meet quotas. This caused millions of people to slowly starve and die, while the ussr made a huge profit. The worst thing about all of this is that there are tons of people who deny it (or say it's not the ussr's fault) but they're even more people who don't know about it. I've actually yet to find another person who knows about this. This is something people need to know about more, and something we need to acknowledge. Please spread this around.
