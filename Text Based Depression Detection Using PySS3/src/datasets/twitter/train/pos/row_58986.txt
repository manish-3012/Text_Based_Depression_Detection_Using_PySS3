I did a little virus-related calculation. After seeing a meme on how killing about 31 thousand people would be the same as planting 20 million trees, I asked my sister to pull up the number of Covid deaths worldwide on Google. 1.52 million. Stick that into a simple formula and you get the number of trees Covid-19 has saved. 966 million trees. I'll leave you guys to figure out your moral compasses.
