Still processing. Did someone need directions or something? I woke up tonight at 12:07am and itâ€™s now 1:05am. I had to go to the bathroom so I made my way and sat on the loo. But I heard someone knocking on the bathroom window outside so I just muttered under my breath â€œFuck off Iâ€™m tiredâ€ washed my hands, gave myself the good olâ€™ finger guns in the mirror and went back to bed. Iâ€™ve been processing this for a while and I donâ€™t know what to think? My bathroom is on the first story, we have ground floor, first story, second story if anyone is confused. â€˜Cuz I am.
