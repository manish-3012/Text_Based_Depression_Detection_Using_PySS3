Man I love the rules in the sub, best rules Iâ€™ve ever seen Bro where do I start with these garbage rules. First off, why do I get my entire post removed for deleting a letter, like why. I mean I want to ask a simple question but noooo, I need to add some extra crap for what exactly? And then the karma thing, like why. Do we have to be some elites to post in a sub about teenagers? And then it says â€œdo not fretâ€ basically saying â€œsry were dumb as hell but pls listen to the stupid rules we make even though they donâ€™t have any purpose or meaning.â€ I also find the flair rule funny, like the mods just gonna look at this and be like â€œno this is more of a rantâ€ and then just delete this like the knuckleheads they are.
