I swear parents get mad if you feel any kind of negative emotion. I wrecked a car last month and I offered to pay for it and everything with the money I earn from my part time job. My dad said it was fine and that I would just be on the bench for a month then I can have my car back. Then they decided to extend my punishment for another two weeks because I didnâ€™t drive for a month per their request! Now theyâ€™re mad because Iâ€™m disappointed and angry! Saying that since Iâ€™m having a negative reaction towards this that I clearly donâ€™t understand the seriousness of driving? Iâ€™m so done I canâ€™t wait until I move out and am on my own.
