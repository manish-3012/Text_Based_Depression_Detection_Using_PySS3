Z...Iâ€™m sorry. Idk if this kinda thing is allowed here, but this is literally my last shot, if the mods ask Iâ€™ll happily take this down. 

Iâ€™ve lost someone, someone so incredibly dear to me that life without her these last couple of weeks has been the worst, sheâ€™s my best friend, more like a sister to me and I clearly did something wrong, what it was Iâ€™m not sure yet but I feel like Iâ€™m at least owed some kind of explanation. Iâ€™m going through a tough time, and to have her by my side would mean the world to me right now. 

Z, on the slim chance that youâ€™re actually reading this, Iâ€™m sorry, whatever I did, Iâ€™m sorry.
