i wanted to tell someone this so iâ€™ll do it here i think iâ€™m getting happier. itâ€™s not like i was sad before, at least i didnâ€™t think i was, but now i want to get out of bed and go to school and i care about finding clothes that i like and making sure i look good and i care about my room and i want to make it mine. but iâ€™m scared. what if something happens and i donâ€™t feel like this anymore. what if i stop caring again. 

ok good morning
