Why do girls have coloured pink tongues at parties? What is it? Hey so Iâ€™m 17 and donâ€™t go to parties, Iâ€™ve been to like 2. FYI Iâ€™m in Australia and basically everyone drinks and gets drunk at parties by this age. So Iâ€™ve seen heaps of photos on Snapchat and Instagram of girls I know from school, at parties poking out their tongues and theyâ€™re like dyed a pinky red colour and Iâ€™m like, what? Is it some alcoholic drink, some drug they do at parties? Iâ€™m genuinely so confused.
