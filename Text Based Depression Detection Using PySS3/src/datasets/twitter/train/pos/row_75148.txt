Ahh, who's there? Is someone there, anyone? The dark surrounds me, nibbles at my flesh. Little creatures, they never stop biting. So please, hold out your hand, and touch me... Ahh, yes, there you are, so close indeed.
Then I am not entirely alone, just yet.
Praise the merciful gods above...
Oh, forgive me.
