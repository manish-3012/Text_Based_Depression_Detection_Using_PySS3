Ugh.. bad thing I did a few years ago. I just feel like I have nobody to talk to about this bc itâ€™s so weird so Iâ€™ll make a post. Back in 8th grade I j****d off in the middle of class (not joking) and I feel so gross about myself and disgusted. Also Iâ€™m worried that someone in that class knew and told people but the thing is I never got caught by a teacher or students so Iâ€™ve just been so fuckin nervous that one day someone would come forward and tell people. Would you report it to a teacher or tell friends if you saw someone doing it in class? Dammit Iâ€™m just frustrated with myself and ashamed and I have no one to talk to. I know itâ€™s disgusting, make fun of me all you want, I just have no one to turn to.
