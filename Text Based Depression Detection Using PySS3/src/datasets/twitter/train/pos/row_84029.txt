Isn't it annoying when parents say that they read an article that phone causes cancer? My mom just read an article that radiation from devices causes brain damage or something. To article writers that talk about this: fuck off. It's useless no matter how much you try to change or lifestyle. Are you gonna say that every single fucking person will get cancer because of fucking radiation from devices? Whole fucking load of bs.
