I got my stolen bike back [story] 2 weeks ago, my bike was stolen (my own damn fault, I forgot to take the keys out) after I parked it at the train station of our town, there were lots of other bikes (it's the Netherlands, what do you want?).

I went away for like 3 hours, and when I returned, my bike was gone. I looked through the other bikes to see if anyone had parked it somewhere else as some kind of prank, but it was gone. My parents and I looked through our town to see if we could spot it somewhere, but no luck.

Yesterday we found my bike. It was parked somewhere one street away from our house. The thief parked my stolen bike literally 1 min walking distance away from our house. It's hilarious how unlucky that thief was.

No, I don't know who stole it, I just stole my bike back and rode off.
