I have been awake for the last 58 hours. I'm challenging myself to go 5 days without sleep. I've currently been awake for 58 hours. I'm starting to forget things and have trouble comprehending some things. Like today I couldn't find my phone for 10 FUCKING HOURS STRAIGHT before realizing I had left it in my drawer. I don't know why I put it in my drawer, I guess I did it because I can't fully understand what I'm doing anymore. And no, I'm not Karma Whoring, I'm just challenging myself. I've been updating my situation on TikTok, and half of the comments are people saying that what I'm doing is stupid and half are people saying that they think it's cool.
