So a man goes in for a prostate exam and the doctor hands him a cup and says I want a sample of your semen by tomorrow. So dude goes home, and comes back the next day. Well when he goes back, the doctor is greeted by an empty cup. The man says... 

"doctor I tried with my right hand. I tried with my left hand. I then asked my wife to try, she tried with her right and she tried with her left. Then when that didnt work we asked the neighbors wife, she tried with her left and right hand. But doctor... we still couldn't open the cup"

I apologize for grammar mistakes or maybe even factual mistakes I am both a female writing a joke that is much better delivered in person than over a text box. Have a good day children and make sure to drink some water and eat something.
