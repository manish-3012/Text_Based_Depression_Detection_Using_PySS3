My great grandma passed yesterday So uh yeah, like the title says, my great grandma who I was pretty close with passed away yesterday and it's really fucked with me.

  Have you ever felt like everything around you doesn't really exist? Or like you're dreaming even though you're not? That's kinda what I was experiencing yesterday nothing really feels right or like it's even real anymore,

I don't really understand what's going on right now, I feel like I should be crying and upset and all of the emotions that would would be affiliated with someone's passing but I'm just, blank, I feel hollow and confused and it all just feels wrong.

If you read this, thank you, I really needed to get this out because nothing feels right anymore.
