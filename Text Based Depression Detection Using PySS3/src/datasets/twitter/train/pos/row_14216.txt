The cutest thing is when my dad texts emoticons/emojis. He always sends me texts at night and stuff because my parents are divorced and I live with my mom on weekdays. He usually sends â•°(*Â´ï¸¶`*)â•¯â™¡ and á•¦(Ã²_Ã³Ë‡)á•¤ or d(^_^o) and it makes my heart melt. He just learned that adding the Japanese keyboard to your phone letâ€™s you access the emoticon selection and he thinks theyâ€™re cute. He also likes sending ðŸ§¡ and ðŸ˜„.

My dad doesnâ€™t show emotion a lot because heâ€™s very shy and had a childhood where emotions were stuffed down and not spoken about, so very small actions where I can see his inner softness shining through are precious to me. He is also single and can have a hard time being confident when dating, so I hope he can learn to be more talkative/open to girls he goes to meet like he can be with me and my sisters.
