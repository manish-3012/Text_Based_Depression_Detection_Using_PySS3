Everyone always tells you to follow your dreams But when I take the spot in the advanced choir, a choir Iâ€™ve wanted to be in and worker super hard for since middle school. Suddenly everyoneâ€™s mad at me. 

I just got this spot a month into my senior year. When all my friends have been in it since sophomore year. I felt so happy and everyoneâ€™s mad at me?
