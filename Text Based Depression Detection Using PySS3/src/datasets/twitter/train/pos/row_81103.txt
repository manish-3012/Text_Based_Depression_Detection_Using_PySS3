Ads on comments? Wtf? I try to go to comment something on someone's post about a movie and because of the stupid ad appearing I end up on the SquareSpace website. Personally I'm not surprised I didn't get an ad for Raid Shadow Legends. But I will not pay for Reddit premium no matter how much Reddit demands I do.

I am going to continue downvoting every ad I see, because I can. And you can't stop me.
