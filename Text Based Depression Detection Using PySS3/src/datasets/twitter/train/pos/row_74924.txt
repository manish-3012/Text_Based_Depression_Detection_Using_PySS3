I feel weird because I have no male friends Let me explain so I'm a male but at school I get bullied a lot  it used to be because I was fat but then I managed to pull myself together but people just kept picking on me and the only people that didn't seem to have an Everlasting hate burning hotter then the fires of hell itself were the girls in fact I don't know why I'm putting this on the internet but I'm bored and wanna see how the internet will react (also no I'm not gay in case you were wondering) so that's it I just go to school and talk about minecraft or cod with a few ofthe girls until lunchtime is over but I feel weird because I'm basicly an outsider like an alien that has been accepted into society but is still out of place anyway you can start wishing me death now
