Will my parents accept it? So if this is gonna be my first post, I just want to know your opinions on this.

My parents are divorced and both of them are in new relationships.
My step dad is a very chill and cool guy, but my step mom is such a Karen in many points. My father went from a nice, loving and chill family to a mostly verbal abusive, superficial and not very open minded one. I argued a lot with my step monster of "mom". 

She complains about every little thing from eating too much (she is like the person who wouldn't eat anything in fear of becoming a little chubby), to not reading enough (In the times of smartphones and movies I still read sometimes and so does my brother). They have two little girls one 6 and one 3 year old.
They use the TV and the smartphones and even tablets on their age and yet she still talks about my brother (13) and me (19) as we are some lazy, not intelligent waste of oxygen.

She even verbally abuses my dad sometimes and basically controls his actions, jokes, language etc. They would not even argue in front of me and my brother beause they were ashamed of them arguing.

And all of her family is in a way like this. Talking behind backs (even of their own family) and such stuff.

So my question is: I am growing my hair to be about shoulder long and want black painted nails, I am a boy btw, and I see no problem in doing so. But I fear the step monster and my dad won't accept it and talk about me behind my back, for said reasons. Do you guys and girls think that my dad might accept it even if my step mom and their whole fam would not?
