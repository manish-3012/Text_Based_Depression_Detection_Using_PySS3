Song lyric interpretation that is a good reminder for us all. "INTO EACH LIFE SOME RAIN MUST FALL! SOME DAYS MUST BE DARK AND COLD!" is the first lyric in the melodic death metal song The Rain by Aetherian. I thought about what this song might be talking about, and I thought some of y'all might need to hear this/be reminded of this.

So the song might not be metaphorical at all, but if it is, I think Panos is talking about how everyone has ups and downs in life. Life may seem like it sucks right now, but it will get better. "IN THE MORNING WHEN THE CLOUDS SCATTER the sun returns it's warmth! FROM THE SOIL LIFE'S BORN, ONCE AGAIN THE SUN RETURNS IT'S WARMTH!" Life will get better and you will 'grow' into a better person. The bad parts of life will often bring on the good parts of life. If you, for example, just left your friend group because they were all toxic and your dad that you don't have friends anymore, now you've learned who to avoid and you can find a new friends group that will ultimately make you happy. Look for the ups that come from the downs in life.
