Something hilarious happened in Among Us So I was playing among us with my brother and all of a sudden he starts bursting out laughing (no we weren't cheating together we were on completely different games.) So I ask what happened and he tell me someone faked medbay scan. So they went into medbay and then stood on the platform for a couple seconds while my brother was watching him to see him scan, but intsead of scanning they just stood there and walk away. I found this so freaking funny

Then a couple rounds later, in the same game, my brother starts laughing again. He tells me that the same dude is doing a fake task in electrical and I got confused because that's a pretty normal thing to do. However, through fits of laughter my bother says he was faking lights when the lights weren't even being sabotaged that round. I started crying laughing.

Anyways I found that funny and wanted to share it. Have a good day and remember safe is just a state of mind and you can die at any moment!
