life got sad and happy so the thing is that i played videogames a lot with my one friend but recently we started to play less and less. at this point i cant enjoy ANY videogame, i can only play for like 10min. untill i get so bored (*bored in that means that it feels like its sucking my soul and happines out of my body*) that i just alt+f4. i watched a lot of anime but that got boring too,i try to go out for a walk every day but it makes me feel the same way.the only joy in my life now is waiting for night to come so i can go to sleep and that makes me really happy, i have never been so happy. and that scares me because i had a lot of suicidal thoughts etc. and now they are all gone...i dont know what the fuck is happening help
