Can some one help me with Guitar?? Pleaseeee!!!! Um. Can some one help?

Hi, my name's Nico, I'm 13, they/them.

I use a app called 'Tabs' It has alot of songs on it, and I can play songs that I know from the chords. 

I'm wondering if anyone knows how to play 'Running Free', by IronMaiden? (IronMaiden,2015Remaster) 

I play acoustic, but I have no fucking clue what the guitar tabs are saying, it's numbers and lines--- I can only understand chords. (like, A, C, D, Em, Am,  and so forth...) 
Help. 

Does any one know a place where they do chords? Or can some one teach me what the actual fuck these lines and numbers are? Please?
