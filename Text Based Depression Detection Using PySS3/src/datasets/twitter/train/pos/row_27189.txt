I think I finally found someone who won't leave me 
[16M] idk if we're supposed to do that in this sub but I'll do it anyway just to be safe Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

(writing this at 3am so excuse the horrible writing please)

At the start of the year, my depression and social anxiety went up to 11, and I was having a really hard time dealing with it since I didnt have anyone to talk to and I don't trust anyone enough to tell them about it. But then I met someone who has pretty similar problems to me.

She's honestly the most perfect person I've ever met. (Without exaggerating at all) She's like an angel. She's kind to everyone and can always manage to see the good in people not matter how bad they are. and she's quickly become the most important person in my life. She stopped me from cutting when no one else could, and she even stopped me from ||killing myself multiple times||. She understands me better than anyone else. It's like she can read my mind.

She's so special and I know that things are gonna be different this time and that this is gonna be the first friend who won't leave me when they find someone more interesting. She seems to care for me as much as I do for her - which is a first for me since I get attached way too easily.

I actually have hope for the first time in years that I'll be able to get better. She's the best friend I've ever had and I love her so much.
