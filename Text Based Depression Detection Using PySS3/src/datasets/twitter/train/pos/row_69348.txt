Why the fuck is this in a movie for little children? And why do I seem to be the only one who is bothered by it? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUuvkqvr9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GUuvkqvr9M)

And sure, you can say "it's just a cartoon" or "it's just a joke" - but would you say the same if cartoons for little children had male characters humiliate and hurt female characters by twisting their tits or ramming something in their crotch so hard it gets stuck, and she falls to the floor at his feet?

And YES, that is EXACTLY what that is, and it's exactly why little girls laugh about that.   
Not because it's slapstick just like any other, but because a girl is humiliating and violating a boy by exploiting his male weak spot and genitals, and he's in the dirt to her feet, pathetically clutching his manhood in male pain and male humiliation, while she stands triumphantly.

WHY. Why did the woman who created this scene think to herself "Hey I know what would be funny! When girls kick boys in the balls really hard from behind! That's appropriate in a kid's movie!"
