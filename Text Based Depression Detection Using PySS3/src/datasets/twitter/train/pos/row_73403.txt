Hey everyone I donâ€™t really have any friends right now so I hope no one minds if I just talk for a bit :). I recently had knee surgery and itâ€™s been a bit of a struggle staying positive but I cleaned my room today and my grades are getting up! I donâ€™t like being around my family much and I wish I could get out more but Iâ€™m stuck inside because I canâ€™t walk. Schoolâ€™s kinda hard on crutches but Iâ€™m getting through it. Iâ€™m also 2 months drug free! Hopefully someone was able to read all this and maybe feel a little better :). Goodnight BITCHESSSS.
