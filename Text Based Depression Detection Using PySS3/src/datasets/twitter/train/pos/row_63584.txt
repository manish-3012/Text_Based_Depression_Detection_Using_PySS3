Girls, can I get some advice on flirting with yall please I'm trying to flirt with my crush a little bit but I gotta walk a really fine line to avoid being pushy/creepy and idk how to do that

What do you like to hear from guys? What compliments should I be giving? Can I straight up tell her I think shes cute and just a fucking awesome person or would that be too pushy? Like how do I flatter her without being too weird about it?

And guys too if you can help please go ahead. I just suck at socializing so I really need some guidance here
