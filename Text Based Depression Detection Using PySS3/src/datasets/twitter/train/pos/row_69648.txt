Is it considered â€œcringeâ€ if I hang a Star Wars poster in my room? For context Iâ€™m almost 15 and the walls of my room are pretty bland so I want to put a Revenge of the Sith poster in my room. I know putting posters in your room was really common in the 80â€™s but nowadays I wonder if itâ€™s â€œcringyâ€ or something I might end up regretting, thanks
