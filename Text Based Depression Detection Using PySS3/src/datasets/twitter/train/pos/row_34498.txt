i accidentally send a â€œhot picâ€ to a guy that i barely know but it was for my ex and now iâ€™m uncomfortable even if i donâ€™t know him irl i feel so bad because i hate getting dick pics or that kind of stuff from men when i donâ€™t ask for it.. i feel like a piece of shit and iâ€™m panicking alone in my room
