IXL fucking sucks Weâ€™ve all heard it before. But I need to bring attention to the fact that IXL is made by a corporation that profits 100-500 million USD per year. They are profiting from students suffering and struggles. And that stupid scoring system, on numerous occasions I was at 99 smart score with over 100 answered questions. And went down all the way to 82 because of a typo or some mistake like that. This app needs to be changed or removed because it is torturing people and making their teachers and parents think that this is a good â€œlearningâ€ tactic. When it is in fact, not good at all and actually discourages students.

All my information and reasoning comes from IXLâ€™s website, and reviews on the App and Google Play store.
