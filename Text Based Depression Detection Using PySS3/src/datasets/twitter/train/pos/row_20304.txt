What is wrong with me am I ill Reality doesn't feel like reality anymore. It almost feels surreal. My school, my parents, even my own reflection feels so alien and far away and I feel like I'm stuck in a random person's body and forced to go on with it. It's not gender dysphoria or anything. I'm fine with my gender. It just feels so far away and fucking weird.

Reality doesn't feel real anymore. Star Trek is more real to me than my life. I know it's a fictional universe but the people there are more real to me than actual real living humans. I know this isn't a good sign but I find my thoughts "slipping into" random scenarios in different realities randomly. I suddenly find myself imagining a conversation between fictional characters and me in the middle of solving some physics questions. It's starting to worry me and reality is fucking terrifying and surreal. Honestly the only time I feel like myself is when I read books and watch star trek and talk to people online on this sub 

I went to the bathroom today at 3am and I freaked out because someone else was inside the mirror for a second and it was very very surreal. Reality is fucking terrifying what the fuck is wrong with me

Edit: I have always been obsessed with something so it's a normal thing for me. The thing I'm worried is that reality doesn't feel real
