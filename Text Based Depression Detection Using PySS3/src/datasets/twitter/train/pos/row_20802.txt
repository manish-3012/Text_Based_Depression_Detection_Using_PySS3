Honestly fuck my dad sometimes So my dad always watches these truck shows, being a truck driver himself he's interested in it so fair enough. But everytime it's on he calls me over to watch it, even though I don't really care. I really try to get into it but seeing as I don't care or know anything about it I can't contribute anything to the conversation. So when he sees I'm bored he asks straight up "are you even a boy".. just because I don't like trucks or whatever. Like wtf? Then he gets pissed at me and tells me to fuck off. And he wonders why I never wanna watch tv with him.
