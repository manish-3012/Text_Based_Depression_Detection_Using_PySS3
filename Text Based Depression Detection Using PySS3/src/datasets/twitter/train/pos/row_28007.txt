I will debate or discuss a wide variety of topics just ask I am 17 and male 

Will debate/discuss multiple topics/try and understand the other sides view or just answer whatever questions you ask me to the best of my ability!

I would prefer you to have a question for me, any topic serious or light hearted. Also I will attempt to keep my responses civil and if I offend you at any point just tell me. Finally please donâ€™t tell me Iâ€™m wrong and leave it at that, explain to me why Iâ€™m wrong or if I really donâ€™t understand a topic send me information on the topic. I am 17 and male
