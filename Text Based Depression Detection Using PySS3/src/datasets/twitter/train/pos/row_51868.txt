2 years in this wonderful horrible place! I don't know how to describe my time on Reddit so far. It's been one of the most welcoming communities I've ever seen, but I've also been ridiculed and made fun of more times than I can count. 

It's really interesting to try and figure out which posts will do well, and where, and I don't think I'm all that good at it yet. 

I'm looking forward to another few years on r/teenagers, probably my favorite subreddit. Thank you all for these wonderful horrible years!

PS. Is this the right flair?
