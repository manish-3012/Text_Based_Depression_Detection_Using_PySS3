Music is super subjective. I was listening to some weird Metal from Russia and it just sounded trash and bad. I had this opinion for several months until one day i listened to it again and it just clicked within me. It was like I was floating. So yeah. It isnâ€™t fair to call music trash the first time you listen to it.
