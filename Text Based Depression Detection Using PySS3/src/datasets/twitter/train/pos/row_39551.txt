my crush is so beautiful it hurts i canâ€™t put it into words, sheâ€™s just flawless inside and out itâ€™s so hard to handle, itâ€™s like a stabbing at my heart every time she sends a snap, whether it be of her socks, a close up of her eye, her full face, her legs or something itâ€™s just beautiful â˜ºï¸
