Please, don't break your father's heart So, my daughter would fit in here, and while she doesn't live with me (she's living on her own now, but I'll always think of her as a teenager) we text pretty often. I usually text her things like songs or memes I think she'll like. 

I texted her a song that YouTube recommended me, that I really enjoyed, and thought she'd enjoy. 

She texted back "oh I've heard that song and love it! It's all over tiktok!" 

Don't let your parents find out you use tiktok like this, and if your dad sends you a song he thinks the kids are listening to, don't tell him it's all over tiktok. 

Now you know, and knowing it's half the battle.  Go Joe!
