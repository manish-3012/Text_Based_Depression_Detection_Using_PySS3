i need advice on my ex i broke up with her about a month ago and she didn't really like it. i want it to be over, but it feels like part of my heart is still in love with her, even if i don't want to be. idk if i should trust my gut and get back together, or go with my head and stay away. and even if i did stay away, i still don't know how to get rid of the feeling of partly still being in love with her
