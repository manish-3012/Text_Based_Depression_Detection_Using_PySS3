i love LOVE when people are mean to me one time i broke up with someone because he was too nice to me. still feel kinda bad for that one but i just couldnâ€™t take it seriously

last night i was on the phone with this guy and he said â€œu gonna go?â€ and i said â€œno i like talking to uâ€ then he said â€œtoo badâ€ and hung up. and holy shit when i tell u i liked him 10 times more after that

moral of the story treating ur girl like shit isnâ€™t always a bad thingðŸƒâ€â™€ï¸
