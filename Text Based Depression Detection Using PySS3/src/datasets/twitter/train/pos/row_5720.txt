Im bored af on my religion class so im gonna write one of the stories that "happens vey often in our SOCIETY" One day I went to a shop near my house, and while I was picking my stuff I realized tha the shop screens were showing a video of a Influencer on youtube. Honestly I dont know him however it was obvious that he was talking without many arguments, he was like 25 years old and like every public figure he had a way to talk, fast and swearing to make people laugh, all of the people on the show were laughing at him while the influencer was saying his opinion of the legal drugs. Then he said sarcastically: And im telling you right now church, religion out of this subject, ok BYE, we dont care about your opinion, everyone was laughing and I just leaved the shop.
