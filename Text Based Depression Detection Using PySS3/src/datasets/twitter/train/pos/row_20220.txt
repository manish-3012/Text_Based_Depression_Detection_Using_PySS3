What the fuck, mods? (Day 2 of requesting polls be allowed on the subreddit) Like, seriously, allow picture posts but not polls? I made a similar post yesterday, but this time I feel I will go into more detail.

# Creeps

It's no secret creeps exist on reddit. Pedos, necrophiliacs, whatever. By posting selfies, teenagers like you and I are susceptible to getting are DMs invaded. Now, of course, this is much less so a problem for males, but females can get completely bombarded with messages. In some cases, this can lead to highly illegal situations, which could hurt the subreddit's integrity.

# Karmawhoring

God damn, some people. They'll post a photo of themselves, give a "clever" title, and watch the aw\*rds and upv\*tes roll in. Sure, I may shitpost, but I don't expect upv\*tes, I just want to make someone laugh, maybe even a new friend! Picture posts can be so effortless and so common, it makes me wish every day was the weekend.

# The Usefulness of Polls

I love data. Polls fulfill my love for data. I love asking questions, but I really enjoy being able to ask a lot of people at once. Polls do just that! They're simple, private and oh so useful. Of course, they should be limited, but we should be able to use them.

# The Shitpost Argument

Now, you might say "But Frost! People will just make stupid polls!" So what? People already make stupid memes and text posts, so all this will do is liven things up! I say we allow polls on the subreddit, at least at some times!

Also, AutoMod sucks. I've had to post this 3 times because I can't mention upv\*tes
