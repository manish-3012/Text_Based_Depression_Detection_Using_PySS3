I think Iâ€™m gonna stop doing stuff with friends for my birthday I think after the fifth grade I stopped having birthday parties, and I wasnâ€™t invited to many either, mainly because I moved to a new state and didnâ€™t have many friends, so I just had a nice dinner with my family at a steakhouse or something on my birthday. In eighth grade I found a new friend group and went to their bday and stuff. In ninth grade and I a bday â€œpartyâ€ after four years of not doing much for my birthday. We went to Main Event and ate at CPK with my closest friends, but it didnâ€™t really feel that exciting anymore. I think at some point you just grow too old for that sort of stuff. I made this post because my birthday is in exactly two weeks and Iâ€™ve decided that all I want to do is cook a nice meaty juicy steak dinner. I love cooking and baking and Iâ€™ve never cooked a steak before. Iâ€™ve been fascinated by steak videos on YouTube and now I want to make one for myself. I might make a cake as well if I have time but I probably wonâ€™t cause schoolâ€™s a bitch. I feel like this will either be a huge success or huge flop. Either way this is gonna be great. I just hope my friends donâ€™t care too much.


TLDR: I donâ€™t want birthday party I just want to cook a nice juicy steak dinner instead of hang out with friend.
