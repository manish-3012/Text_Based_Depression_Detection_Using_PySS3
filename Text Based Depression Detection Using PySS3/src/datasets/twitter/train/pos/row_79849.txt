Cringe Moment So... a while ago, I had â€œcrushâ€ on this girl, remind you A WHILE AGO. So, anyways I would always slide up on her snap story trying to make conversation but today (no longer have a crush on her) I read through our old messages and there was one where she asked to recommend her a song, I wanted to be funny somehow, and I fucking sent, â€œEminem - Fackâ€ Wtf was going through my brain to recommend her that... welp.

P.S 

Look up song at your own risk
