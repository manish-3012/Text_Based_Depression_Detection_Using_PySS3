This happened many years ago I was taken for an eye checkup, doc asked me to look into an apparatus,I was about to position my head and look into it when I remembered 


About that scene from Final Destination in which the eyes of a girl gets fried by a malfunctioning Laser.

I screamed and ran out of the doctor's room, my mom convinced me that nothing will happen and my eyes are safe, but I didn't allow them to check...
