School friends vs Real Friends I moved to a middle-income neighborhood, everyone is friends and the parents are like lovable soccer moms. I immediately noticed how close everyone was from such a young age, so I knew it'd be hard to make friends. Well now it's been 3 years and it has been EXTREMELY hard, my only friends were new kids are we aren't even friends anymore because of frickin MIDDLE SCHOOL. I made a lot of new friends that I am so happy to have gotten to know until a TikTok pointed out 'school friends' are 'real friends' I didn't know what he meant by school friends until I realized I only hang out with them in school. Never at home, or really text. But that's not my fault, my parents don't have two cars or feel completely safe with me over a stranger's house. We don't live in a house and who would even come over? Anyway now I feel horrible and lonely because I don't have any real friends. I can't believe after 3 years I still haven't adjusted to my new surroundings...ugh life :(
