Somebody please give me hope. Howdy there.
I am 13 and am now in 8th grade and I already wanna die.

I have a 15 in algebra and I hate it so much.

We have been learning the same thing in algebra for 5 weeks, and I still don't know what we are doing.

Somebody please give me hope.

I don't think that a 15 is a good grade.
