I wanna get earings but my grandparents (who live with us in a house outside) are old school ans so are my other grandparents (who visit regularly) are also old school, what do I do? My parents and my friends and the rest of my family are ok with it, so I just need to convince them or I can lie to them and try not to let them see or something, what should I do?

I do have long hair so hiding it wouldn't be too much of a hassle and Im also wearing headphones at home most times, but we eat togethor at the dinner table once a week so
