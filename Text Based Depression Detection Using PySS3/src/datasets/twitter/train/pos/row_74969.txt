Both compliments and criticism feel like personal attacks to me I take criticism extremely poorly. Whenever someone criticises something I've done, I take it as a personal attack. I don't feel that my work was bad. I feel that I'm terrible.

But I also can't take a compliment. If you compliment me, I feel like it disingenuous. I feel like people only compliment me if they want something from me. So compliments also feel like a personal attack to me.

I know that this makes no fucking sense. And I know that I'm incredibly toxic because of this.
