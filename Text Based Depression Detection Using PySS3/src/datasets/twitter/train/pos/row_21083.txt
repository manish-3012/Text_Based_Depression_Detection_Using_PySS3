was anybody here during my great lesbian crisis i have an update still queer. still bisexual. 

actually now im wondering if that was triggered by how often i see comphet getting misused + the BLATANT biphobia on twitter dot com and elsewhere prevalent in my life + it gave me this feeling that i was finally queer enough for the cis gays. gross !!!!!
