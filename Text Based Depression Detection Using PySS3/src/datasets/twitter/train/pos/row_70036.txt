Fucking hate false hope... Itâ€™s so stupid... WELL we learnt about circuits today in physics, and me being the absolute nerd that I am obviously got all the questions right whilst the rest of my class was sitting there scratching their heads (mind you, we are top set so tbh that was quite disappointing but whatever) and anyways eventually the teacher put a question on the board and asked us to write down the answer. I immediately told my friend the answer (coz Iâ€™m an arrogant bitch and my friends always laugh at me for knowing the answer before the teacher even finished the sentence) and so ppl around us were like wtf how did u get that. So I started explaining it to like basically half of the class (including the boy I like). Eventually the teacher was like â€œI heard a lot of discussion about the question, but a person that was particularly loud was Ron (me)â€ but thatâ€™s beside the point... the POINT is that after the lesson my friend (who sat next to the boy I like) told me that he was staring at me when I was talking, and I was like nahhh he was just looking at me coz I was explaining the question and she straight up went like *no, he was staring at you* (but like in a good way) so now Iâ€™m sad coz it gives me hope that he likes me even tho I know that he doesnâ€™t...

Anyways I hope you have a lovely day guys &lt;3
