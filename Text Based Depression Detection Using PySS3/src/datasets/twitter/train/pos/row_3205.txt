I want to pursue an engineering career Hello.  I just want to know if it is still possible for me.  I get mostly bs but some cs and some as.  Like currently I have a 72 in math although I am in calculus as a softmore becuase I used to do good in math.  And a d in Spanish cause I really suck at that.  Is it possible for me to get into a good engineering colledge?
