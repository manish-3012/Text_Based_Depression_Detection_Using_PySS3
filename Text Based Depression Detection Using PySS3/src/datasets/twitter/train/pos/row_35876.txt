If someone has a Xbox One S, please help I have instant-on turned on, it's doing mosquito noises 30 seconds, stops for 5 seconds and repeats this process, I checked whether that's the controller because i heard it's supposed to do a low hum noise, but it isn't, please help, I am genuinely quite scared of my Xbox One being broken
