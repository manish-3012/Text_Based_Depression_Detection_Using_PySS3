I have to story to confess to you all I once saw a girl and I started liking her but I was too shy to even talk to her.She was in my previous class and I couldn't even talk to her just cause I am shy.Now after last year was over I just saw she was not in my class this year.So I just forgot everything.Then after 2 months I was scrolling insta and I saw her.Then I thought to dm her.We started a convo and I found out that she is also a gamer.So we started playing.Like we actually become good friens then after a while I was busy for a couple days so didn't talk to her.So she probably didn't text me back thinking that I didn't want to talk to her.So days passed and then one day our datesheet of exams came so I decided to talk to her about that it was a small convo and it ended soon like in 7 minutes or so.Then we were in no contact since July and now our results came.My bff was good friends with her last year but now they were out of contact.I didn't want to text her but my bff forced me to ask her about her result.Again she replied her % and so did I and then again we ended the convo.So now we both used to only see stories.And now she started hiding them from me ( ik this cause I follow her from a secret account).
