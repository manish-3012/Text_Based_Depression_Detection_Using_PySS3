Many Random people you've seen or hear of at some point in your life are now probably dead It could be a pedestrian, a passer by, someone you saw in a protest, someone you saw in an instagram post, the passenger that sat next to you last flight, myself in the future or any random person really... and theres practically no way for you to make sure if they are alive or dead
