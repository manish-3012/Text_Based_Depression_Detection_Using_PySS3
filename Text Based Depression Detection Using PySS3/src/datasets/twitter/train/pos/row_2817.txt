I need encouragement So I've been hanging out with my friend, for a while now, and recently (by recently I mean last year) he introduced me to his other friends. One of these people he introduced to me is a girl, who I'll just call CH for now.  I thought she was weird at first, and vice versa, but we soon started to hang out with each other, and grew to be good friends. As you can imagine, I sorta became attracted to her, and want to ask her out, but I'm scared that she'll say no and I'll lose my relationship with her. So I'm asking you guys for encouragement. Now encourage me.
