Day 1 of posting the phrase liquid whales until I get a girlfriend (or more likely forget to post) You used to say you in love 

I used to say that shit back 

Takin that shit from the heart 

Now look where the fuck we at 

Girl you got me goin out bad 

Love scars and you got me real sad 

Thinkin that you had a past 

I was hoping that shit was gonna last 

*and todayâ€™s filler is brought to you by Trippie Redd and his song, Love Scars*
