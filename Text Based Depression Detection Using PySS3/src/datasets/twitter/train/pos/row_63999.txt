Relationship progression as teens So I've been dating this girl for around a month, and I've caught up with an old mate and told him about it. He's been with his girlfriend for around 2 years now, and they're pretty serious.

He asked me a few questions and I thought they were really weird. He wondered if I'd sent nudes or done anything inappropriate and I thought it was really early for that type of stuff. I said it was really early, but he said that was around when they did it, and I thought that was weird asf. I got thinking about it and was a bit confused because  the person I'm dating has a not so great history when it comes to sexual acts. 

I guess teen relationships do end up going a bit quicker because getting to know a teenager is pretty easy, and also most are just doing a horny, but is that too fast? I'm not sure if we're going slow or they went fast..
