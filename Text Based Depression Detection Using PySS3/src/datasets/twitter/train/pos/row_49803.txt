that moment when you realise he wasnâ€™t actually that busy and that he just didnâ€™t like you for who you are. heâ€™d leave you on delivered for hours at a time, yet sent your friend instant replies. 

heâ€™d talk about his future to your friend. heâ€™d look at her whenever he made a joke or laughed. he always walked to classes with her. you could never walk besides them. no wonder he was fine with her touching him and making sexual jokes around him. 

you finally realise that there isnâ€™t actually any excuse he can hide behind. you just werenâ€™t good enough. 

and you still invited him to your birthday party. did you actually think heâ€™d ever like you back? fucking dumbass. you stupid fucking dumbass.
