My brother is a different kind of dick Iâ€™ve been playing titanfall 2 recently, and there is a specific time your â€œclanâ€ leader can set for the happy hour, where completing a match within the hour will award you with external coins for the day. I went to my brother and asked him if I could play *one match* thatâ€™s it. They normally last around 10-15 minutes. He stays up super late playing anyways so surely he could spare just that little bit of time right? No. Although he did take his ACT today he wouldnâ€™t even let me play for a short bit of time. Itâ€™s not just the ACT tests he does this shit all the time. Iâ€™ve never once played more than I should when I ask this, but he comes home some days and bluntly tells me he wants the entire night.
