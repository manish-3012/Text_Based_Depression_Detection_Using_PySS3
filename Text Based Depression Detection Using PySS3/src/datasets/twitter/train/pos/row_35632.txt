Hello everyone I just wanted to address something that some of you might need to hear right now or sometime in the future. What I wanted to talk about was grooming Recently I have heard stories about someone grooming minors and I wanted to tell everyone that if your ever in that situation tell an adult I know what struggles you may be going through because of this but telling an adult is your best bet if you donâ€™t have any trusted adults that you can contact there is always the police or maybe even a teacher or a counselor but do your best to get out of that situation no matter what. Thatâ€™s all I have to say have a good day!
