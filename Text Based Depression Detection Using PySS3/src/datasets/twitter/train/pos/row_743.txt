Girls, how do yâ€™all feel about guys with big noses? Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m anywhere from a 5-7/10. I have great hair, &amp; a great smile with dimples, but I have a gigantic nose that Iâ€™m super self conscious about. Again, Iâ€™ve got the great dimples &amp; smile, but when I smile, my nose expands to the size of an elephant. How do yâ€™all feel about this?
