Obese people be like " I like my body the way it is, haters keep hating" Bruh, I'm concerned about your health. Sure, you can love your body, but please be more healthy. If you can't change it, I wouldn't blame you. But really be more healthy, stop stuffing yourself with so much unhealthy food. Treating yourself once in a while is okay, but control yourself okay?
