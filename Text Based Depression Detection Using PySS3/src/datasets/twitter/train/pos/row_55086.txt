Am I the only one who finds Freshman dating Seniors a bit odd? Idk why, but in my personal opinion I don't really like the idea of Freshman dating Seniors for me at least. If there's people who have healthy relationships like that then good for y'all, I'm not here to tell you who to date, but at least while in highschool I wouldn't want to be a 14/15 y/o dating a 17/18 y/o. My mom dated someone who was 3 years older than her in highschool and said that they were fine but I feel like it wouldn't sit right with me if I were to get in a relationship with someone that much older than me at that age.



What do you guys think? I personally don't care who you date as long as y'all are being careful and are staying away from creeps but for me at least I wouldn't be comfortable with it.
