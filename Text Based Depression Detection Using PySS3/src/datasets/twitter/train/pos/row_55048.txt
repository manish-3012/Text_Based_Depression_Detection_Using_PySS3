He said he isn't interested in dating at the moment ***I haven't confessed, we were just talking about a mutual friend liking someone and then we both asked each other if we liked anyone***


He said that until he's less busy and has stuff more on track (he's a **super** busy person) he wouldn't want to consider dating anyone until he's out of highschool if he'd keeps being busy like this. He also said at the beginning before we went in depth about it that he doesn't see a huge point in it since the majority of highschool relationships end up failing. He's very focused on his grades and sports (straight A's with honors and AP courses and does great with his sports, hella sweet too 1000000/10 would recommend being his friend LMAO) so I can see where he comes from. We talked about it a little and we both came to the conclusion that if you're free enough to date and want to then go ahead, but if not then don't bother yourself with it.



I don't think I'll stop liking him (well, unless someone else steps into the picture) since I'm not currently looking into a relationship rn and I'm not really that hurt by it. I've liked him for a long time and have tried to stop liking him, but it hasn't happened so I think it's best to just let it happen how it happens without trying to alter anything unless I'm hurt by what's happening. If I end up telling him, I end up telling him. If he ends up changing his mind then good for him, but he seems happy with how his life is going so I'm happy for him too.



I go to the same school as him next year, so I'm looking forward to seeing him again. I haven't seen him in a while due to covid and how busy we both are so it'll be nice. Being his friend is enough for me. If he decides he wants to date then maybe I'll make a move, but I'm fine with how things are going right now.



Thanks for reading my little vent LMAO
