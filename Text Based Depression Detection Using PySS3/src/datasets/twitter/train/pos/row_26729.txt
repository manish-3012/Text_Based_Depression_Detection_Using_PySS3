Do people actually think white women have it worse than black men? (In the west) I made a poll and found almost 20% of people thought it was worse to be a white woman? Wtf? Okay lets get the facts straight: first, the courts. White people are privileged in the courts already, and women have it so much better than men in the courts in general. If comvicted of a crime, white women will get the least longest sentences, and black men would get the longest. Second, okay, black men will face more discrimination than white women. There were a lot of myths popularized that black men were dangerous. White women are defidently thought of commonly as victims, even if they dont play the victims. Black people are very commonly stereotyped more than white people in general. Black people also have to deal with the reason black lives matter had to be made. Hey, white women can normally talk to the cops. Black neighborhoods in the past were always funded less. And don't even get me started on "all lives matter". Black men are treated worse than white women. In the west, what do white women have that makes them face more discrimination than men?
