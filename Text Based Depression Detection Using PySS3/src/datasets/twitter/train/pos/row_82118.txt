I am not sure that we deserve to survive as a species We are at each otherâ€™s throats. Nuance seems like a forgotten dream. Our iPhones arenâ€™t getting any better. Prices are going up. Wages are stagnant. 

Young people are being destroyed by overprotection and social deprivation. The desire to fall in love is being lost to pornography. Smoke continues to fill the sky. Meaning is difficult to find. 

Is this the end of us?
