Y'know these shitty send your email adress and password and phone number and we'll give u an Iphone 18 pro max My mom fell for them, she said that it wasn't a scam, because the guy on facebook said that it is real and there were these fake comments saying it worked. Funny how some ppl can trust an obvious scammer but won't believe their son with \*insert coding experience that if mentioned could throw me in r/iamverysmart\*
