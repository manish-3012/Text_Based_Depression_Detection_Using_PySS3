why the FUCK do I always do this literally every time I start liking a girl I get on some kind of manic high and think sheâ€™s awesome and I really want to date her. Then I realize that she definitely doesnâ€™t like me back and I get depressed even though I didnâ€™t even shoot my shot and I somehow manage to convince my that shooting my shot is bad because I donâ€™t want to ruin a friendship. to be clear I still would love to date her but uh, sheâ€™s not only miles out of my league, but also, Iâ€™m scared if she doesnâ€™t feel the same way Iâ€™ll ruin a really good friendship and make everything awkward, cuz we run in the same social circle.
