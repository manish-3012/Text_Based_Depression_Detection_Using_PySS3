Your options are Cute anime girl wit blue hair, cute anime girl who is a nerd, cute, athletic childhood friend who gets bad grades, and the teacher. Who do you think will get the protagonist 

Right off the bat the first two are not options, itâ€™s physically impossible to write a story where a nerd or someone with blue hair ends up with the protagonist, thatâ€™s just basic physics. Iâ€™m hoping he ends up with the childhood friend cuz she cute and age gaps weird and not ok but honestly it could go either way 

I think Iâ€™ve gotten too invested in â€œWe Never Learnâ€ 

Donâ€™t spoil anything
