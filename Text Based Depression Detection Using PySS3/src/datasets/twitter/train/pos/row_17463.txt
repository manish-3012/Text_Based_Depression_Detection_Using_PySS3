I Finally Did It My step dad is a nice person normally. When you talk to him he is very nice, and he will never think of being rude to you. Theres a catch. Alcohol changes everything. Hes a drunk fucking asshole whom I hate when drunk.

(I am 14 years old btw, 15 in 2 weeks)

On to the story. Last night my mom and step dad got into a fight. My step dad was drunk and was being  really unfair to my mom. He is a pathological liar, a terrible trait to have. He was saying how he hates her, she's a cunt, a bitch, slut, etc. I've never had the guts to really stand up for adults. Its fucking scary. I dont want to make anyone upset and me get hurt, (I know that wouldn't happen but my brain is weird.) As he's yelling at her he says, "I hope you die, I hope you die, a horrible death." Hes never said anything like that and it was the last  straw for me. For the first time in my life, I stood up for my mom, and I feel great. I said, "GET YOUR DRUNK FUCKING ASS OUT OF HERE (name)" And he just left immediately. 

I feel really good and made my mom really happy.
