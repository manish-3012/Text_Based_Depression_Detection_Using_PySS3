Found a literal time capsule to the 90s There's this thing called [worlds.com](https://worlds.com) and it was like an MMO created back in 1995. It's abandoned now with a small playerbase of like 30 people. 

The whole thing hasn't been updated since the 90s and there's all the original stuff from when it was created, and the servers are still running and it's free. Some places in it are a tad creepy but I think that it's really cool to have a virtual archive of those early internet times. Check it out sometime if ya want.
