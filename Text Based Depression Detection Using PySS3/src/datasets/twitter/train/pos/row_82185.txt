The biggest karma whore in the universe So I have been browsing Reddit for a while and I stumbled upon this gem account u/smexyredditor69.
He apparently survived cancer had 2 children who both got heart surgery (while 13) and his grandpa caught covid . He also reposts others work( like artwork etc). I hope he steps on lego .


Ps:report him so his acc will be banned
Ps2: turns out that the 13 year old who beat cancer was posted on this sub beforez
