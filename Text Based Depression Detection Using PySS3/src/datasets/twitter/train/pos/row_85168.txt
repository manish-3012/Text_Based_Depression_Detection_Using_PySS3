Genuine question I am a good student. I have always had straight Aâ€™s and am in advanced classes and such, but I always hate my classmates when it comes to school. I have a lot of friends, and am generally the nerdy kid who knows everything in most of my classes, and when we are just talking or hanging out Iâ€™m fine, but when we compare notes or do projects together I canâ€™t handle it. Everyone is just so immature. As an example, we were doing essays for American history, mine was on Alexander Hamilton, and was like 10000 words essay that I had spent 2 weeks on. When we did peer review, I looked at peoples essays and just was surprised by the lack of detail and the overall laziness of the writing. My idea is that I take pride in my work, and am doing my best on everything. What is wrong with me? Why do I hate my classmates? Is this normal?
