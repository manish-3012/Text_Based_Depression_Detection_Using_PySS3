My car was stolen So I was just sitting Iâ€™m my house on the couch doing homework, when my stepdad gets home. I go to unlock it for him, and when I open the door he looks at me all puzzled and says,â€Hey, whereâ€™s your car?â€ Iâ€™m like what do you mean, so I look and itâ€™s not out there. I tell him i havenâ€™t driven or even been outside. So he makes a couple calls, one to see if it was towed somewhere, and we were told there were no tows in my neighborhood. Then he calls the PD to report it stolen. After that, we go around asking the neighbors if they saw anything, or if the ones who had a Ring system got anything, and so far what we got is one of them has a Ring system pointing directly where my car was, but he doesnâ€™t currently have the password for it. The other guy who had a Ring saw that it was gone at 8:12, but that was all he could see. So we have a time frame between 7:10, because thatâ€™s when my stepdad left, and 8:12. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.
Update: Ok so we got a text from the guy who forgot his Ring password, and it turns out it was stolen at 4:35 this morning.
