okay so heres how im gonna tell my dad ive been experiencing covid signs. Okay so really, ive had these signs since like 3-4 days ago but i didnt know my mom had covid and i just thought it was a cold or just my body being an asshole.

So yea mom had covid, i was at her house and im really sus that i caught it.

So im gonna go up to my dad and be like "uhh so for the past 2 days i think i been having corona sytompons"

I wanna say 2 days because if i say 4 hes gonna yell at me for not telling him sooner
