I got banned from r/Trump (explanation in this post if you want it), so Iâ€™m posting this here. Donâ€™t know where else to put this *explanation for my r/Trump ban* [Basically, I got banned from the Trump subreddit for asking if he was a racist (which he is, donâ€™t even try to say heâ€™s not). About 50 people said he was, and 140ish said that he wasnâ€™t. I got banned for posting an â€œirrelevant question to only be a troll because heâ€™s not racist and blm isâ€ according to the mods of r/Trump.]

For context of this rant, somebody posted a video on r/Trump of two Biden supporters ripping up signs and stealing a kidâ€™s hat. The text in the post talking about the video said that â€œTrump needs to win to put an end to this insanityâ€ or something like that. Hereâ€™s what would have been my comment on that post (if I wasnâ€™t banned and could comment):



Iâ€™m sorry, I do think this is wrong [talking about the Biden supporters being mean to the kid]. But on a side note:

1. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to have unprotected sex with a pornstar right as his fifth child is being born from his third wife

2. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to be able to brag about his *rights* to sexually harass women because heâ€™s a celebrity and rich

3. I also think itâ€™s wrong for a man to have things like #2 be exposed during his campaign and still get elected

4. I also think itâ€™s wrong that a man can hide in his bunker while there are protests outside his window calling for black people to be given human rights

5. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to lie about #4 saying that he was â€œjust checkingâ€ the bunker. 

6. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to be able to say that things were better in â€œthe good old daysâ€ when black people would be â€œcarried out on stretchersâ€ if they ever misbehaved in public 

7. I also think itâ€™s wrong for a man to try and sell one of his territories after a natural disaster (that he has the responsibility to help with) because he didnâ€™t want to deal with â€œdirty peopleâ€ (Rise up mi familia boricua ðŸ‡µðŸ‡·)

8. I also think itâ€™s wrong for a man to endorse a policy that he put into place where children are starving to death in â€œcampsâ€ in MÃ©xico after being separated from their parents, and after theyâ€™ve made the journey from South America seeking a better life in the emerald city where one can live â€œthe American dreamâ€

9. I also think itâ€™s wrong for a man to say he is â€œthe least racist person in the worldâ€ after not publicly denouncing the KKK, saying things like â€œthe good old days,â€ and calling black people â€˜thugsâ€™ for protesting because they get killed in the streets by white people

10. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to talk about how mail-in ballots will cause voter fraud while simultaneously sabotaging postal systems to make sure he wins again

11. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to wish a pedophile well while he has still not wished her victims well

12. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to criticize multiple people of color because heâ€™s jealous of their literacy levels and how much higher level words that they use

13. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to give nicknames like â€œsleepyâ€ to someone that very well might have moderate dementia but still has the guts to run for president

14. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to mock a person with disabilities on live television and make the person into a joke

15. I also think that itâ€™s wrong for someone to talk about creating jobs when his country is in the worst shape in a global pandemic

16. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to talk about how great the stock market is when his country is in the worst shape in a global pandemic that could easily be tamed

17. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to give countless jobs to the Latinx community while complaining that theyâ€™re â€œstealing our jobsâ€

18. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to deliberately and intentionally NOT say that Black Lives Matter

19. I also think itâ€™s wrong for someone to label an entire ethnicity as rapists, drug dealers, and criminals while still assuming that â€œsome are good peopleâ€

Thereâ€™s a lot more I could say. 



Thanks to all of you that read this. It just really gets under my skin when I see people that still support this fool
