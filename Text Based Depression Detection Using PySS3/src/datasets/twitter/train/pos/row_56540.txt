Am I an idiot and is it a disorder? I feel empathy for. EVERYTHING. 

From piece of paper, to broken pencils, to stuffed toys, to mosquitoes and flies.

When I have a tray of cookies and have 1 left I feel bad for them because they must feel lonely and left out (I hate being left out myself, they must too)

I haven't been able to kill any bugs myself for past couple years because I feel bad for them. They are same living creatures and might be scared to die like myself, just trying to find foods to eat.

I can't throw out one thing without the other if two things came to me together.

I can't throw away broken pencils (broken into two pieces) in separate trash can because they'll feel lonely.

I feel like worlds biggest idiot sometimes being like this.
