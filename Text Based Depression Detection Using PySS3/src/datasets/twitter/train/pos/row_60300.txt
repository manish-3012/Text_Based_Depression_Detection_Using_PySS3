It being 1:38 on a school night at the time of me writing this, I want to explain the root of my depression with no fear of my parents finding out. I'm tired of hiding. It was a normal weekend for me. I was in the front room, playing some wii sports resorts when my parents started fighting. It was late. The cops were called, and my father spent a week in jail. Some time after that fiasco, my father came home to let a scenario of much of the same origins, but far greater caliber unfold. It was a normal weekend for me. I was in the front room, playing some wii sports resorts when my parents started fighting. It was late. This time the fighting was cut short with my father dissapearing into the closet to fetch his shotgun. He load one round, took the safety off, and pointed it at my mother. He was drunk. I was standing next to my mother, looking into my father's eyes, when I decided to go over to my father to give him a hug. His stance didn't change. I went back and fourth between my mother and father, forced to try and resolve the conflict for what seemed like hours, but what was probably ten minutes. Then my father clicked open his shotgun, took out the shell, put it away, and drove off, disapearing for two years, long enough for my six year old self to forget about the incident for a while. He snuck back into my life, and he is a good father, but I am very scared of him. I think my whole family has forgotten, or hoped that I have forgotten to keep me safe, but the wound has just festered. I now have no faith in humanity, and my family doesn't seem genuine. I feel like I'm alone. I feel like I am constantly hiding from them. I don't feel loved.
