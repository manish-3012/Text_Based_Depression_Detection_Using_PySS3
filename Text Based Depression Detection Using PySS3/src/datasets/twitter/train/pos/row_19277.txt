My knee dislocated... again My knee has had problems for a few years now of dislocating and ive been doing physio to help to muscles that cause my knee to be loose and i had a good run of it not dislocating for a year and i had just lost that streak

I nearly needed a ambulance but whilst my parents were on the phone it just popped back in and im now sat here in agony trying not to move.

God i hate my knee.
