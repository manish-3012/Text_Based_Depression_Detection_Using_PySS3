I feel alone and pathetic Whenever i look at my recent messages i don't see my friends i see people who i have a relationship with that they're just going with and if i leave it they're just gonna let it go and that takes a lot of energy and so i'm left with no real friends and noone that i can talk to about anything that's why i'm just sharing it with a bunch of strangers on reddit
