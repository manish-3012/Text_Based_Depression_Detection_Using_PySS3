What do you find â€œhardâ€ about maths? So Iâ€™m in year 11 in Australia, so 16 turning 17 this year and I do math methods and specialist maths, and so far I havenâ€™t found it hard and made me realise my passion for maths, however I know that many people do find it challenging so wanted to know what that was? 

Is it the way it is, a particular area of maths such as geometry, quadratics etc or just about anything
