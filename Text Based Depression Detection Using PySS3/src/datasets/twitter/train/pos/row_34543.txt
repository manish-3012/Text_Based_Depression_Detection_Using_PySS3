One of my animal companions left us Yesterday one of my cats died. When my mother found him, he was just laying on the floor, without any sign of injury. It's most likely that one of his older illnes with fungus over came his heart, and it couldn't take it anymore. My mother took it really badly, she has been crying for hours yesterday and today too. He was one of my best friends, altrough he liked my mother much more. She said that she doesn't want a cat anymore, it pains her too much. Thankfully I have a habbit that before I go out, I play and pet my cat(s) for a 10 minutes, so I have no regrets that I couldn't say goodbye to him. It was hard today not to wonder where he might be, usually at this time he would be in my bed. Sorry to put this here, I just don't have anyone to talk about this.
