I had to clip my nails while hiding in my room Here's some context:

My parents are very religious (Hindu) and they follow a superstition that we're not allowed to cut our nails after the sun goes down. This isn't a problem for most of the year, but around the last few months the sun goes down at 5:30pm. I had a guitar lesson at 6:00pm, and my nails were too long to play, so I had to lock myself in my room to cut them. It was just a bizarre experience
