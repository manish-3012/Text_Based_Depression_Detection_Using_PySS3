I can just imagine the call between your COD character and the dude who drops the nuke once you get 30 kills Like this

Operator: "hey i just got 30 kills"

Homebase: "ok and?"

Op: "I did it without dying"

Hb: "yeah i assumed that, that's how you're talking to me"

Op: "ok so yeah I'd like to request a tactical nuke"

Hb: "a what?, you think we just have those lying around?"

Op: "well yeah I'd assume so"

Hb: "gimme a sec, ok we're do you want us to drop it?"

Op: "right on top of my current position!"

Hb: "umm... On top of you?"

Op: "yep right on me and my teammates"

Hb: "you want use to use a nuke worth millions just to kill 12 people including your team?"

Op: "yep"

Hb "fuck this, i quit"
