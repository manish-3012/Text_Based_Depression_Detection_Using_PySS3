A friend tried to rip me off with fake AirPods, what should I do? My â€˜friendâ€™ hit me up the other day asking if I wanted to buy his AirPods for $90 cus he bought them for his brother but then his brother got them for Christmas. 

I had lost mine and so thought it was a pretty good deal. So I tell him Iâ€™ll pay half and then pay the rest when they arrive. When they arrive they are convincing, but I know theyâ€™re fake because Iâ€™ve had AirPods before.

I told him I didnâ€™t want the fakes and heâ€™s insisting theyâ€™re real even though Iâ€™ve proved him wrong countless times.
Then I said Iâ€™m not paying the rest and will send them back to him if he agrees to gives my $40 back.

I feel like he shouldnâ€™t get away with it that easily, what should I do?
