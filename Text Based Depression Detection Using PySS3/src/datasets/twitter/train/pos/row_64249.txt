[edit]. this post was removed, I'm guessing it's because it was too short. I suppose I'll have to try to format things according to the rules of the road.

[edit]. I'm reposting this because I have been told that the original post was taken down. I did check with mods and someone said it looked like the original post was still up. so now I'm not really sure except just a repost this, just in case.
