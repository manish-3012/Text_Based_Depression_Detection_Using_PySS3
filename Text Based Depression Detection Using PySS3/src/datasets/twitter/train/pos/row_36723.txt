My mom has covid Ever since covid happened, we've been quarantining, wearing masks, social distancing, and all that stuff. I recently found out about how my mom tested positive for covid, who i live with. I don't want to correlate the  unrelated factors that could have influenced her diagnosis. I'm just kind of going through a lot and I wanted to make a post about it. I always thought that covid was always going to stay away from my loved ones, since we were doing everything right, and now I'm afraid to touch my mom's phone when she asks me if her email is grammatically correct. I've been exposed to someone who has covid now, and I'm low-key panicking. Im afraid the rest of my family may test positive too, and that I won't be able to participate in things like school sports anymore. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?
