Am I in the wrong? So, I am a mod in a Discord server, and now someone is upset with me because I took away powers they shouldn't have had, it's not their fault, though, but, they're upset with me because I decided to remove their powers after talking with the owner about removing their instead of them and they feel like it's my fault and that they're a "war criminal" for doing shit that I wasn't mad at them for doing. And I feel bad about it now because it was my fault and I upset them, and I don't want to get mad at them, because I don't want to ruin our friendship. Am I really the fucking asshole for doing my job? Because I sure fucking feel like it.
