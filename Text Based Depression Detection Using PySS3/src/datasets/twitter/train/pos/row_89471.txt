I'm convinced my parents want me to get in trouble just so they have an excuse to take away my privacy. So my parents always used this software called Qustodio and still use it on my sister and on my PC, but ever since I got my new phone then I was able to talk them out of it but we have a rule where they can check it whenever they want and it has to be downstairs when going to sleep. Mostly I have been doing it but there have been nights where I'm feeling especially down or I just cant sleep. I've tried to tell my parents this but they still go insane about it. And recently we just got back from a trip and I've been falling asleep especially early, which means I keep forgetting to put my phone down. Now the part where I get the title from is that my mom is a very light sleeper and usually wakes up alot of times during the night. And I fell asleep with my door wide open, and my bedroom light on which is pretty bright. And there is no way she stayed asleep or didnt see it. And when I woke up yesterday they yelled at me and told me they would reinstall Qustodio if it keeps happening, and now its 3:35 AM, I woke up 9 minutes ago, its gonna happen again. And oh, if I do try to go downstairs right now then the great part is my stairs and floor are extremely creaky, the floor not nearly as much as the stairs but still more than it should which means I wake everyone up. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get this off my chest.
