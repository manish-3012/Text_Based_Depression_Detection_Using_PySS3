I really hope she finds herself eventually... This girl I've known for a very long time has been being very sexually active lately. Now, I don't really care about that, obviously it's her body and her choice. What I do care about is that she either lied to me or that's not truly who she wants to be. A while ago, she told me that she wasn't the type of girl to "fuck and chill" and even knowing what I know now I still believe her. 

Yet right now she's doing that, she's literally sleeping with all the most notorious fuckbois and I'm kinda worried that she's gonna catch a disease or get pregnant or something. 

Sure it could just be that she was lying when she told me she wasn't that type of girl, but I don't think so. She was ready to block me forever just for thinking she might be interested in that kind of thing with someone. She was truly mad, and that's the only time I've ever seen her like that. It seems to me that she thinks sex and validation from guys is gonna make her happy but it's not. All it's gonna do is hurt her in the long run. Once she goes to find an actual relationship, nobody's gonna take her seriously and lots of guys are gonna use her.
