Regarding my plans to cosplay as Anna from Frozen, I may have found a way to make money off it Once I get ahold of the head, would it be a good idea to promote myself as a â€œPrincess performerâ€?  
  
I mean, once I put on the costume, boots, gloves and head, you wonâ€™t even know that the â€˜princessâ€™ is actually a boy.
