Do any other males prefer talking to females? Idk, when I talk to guys irl they're always talking about sports, or LITERALLY ANY VIDEO GAME I DON'T PLAY. Like Warzone, or Warframe. I don't pay any of those. I play Minecraft and Apex. And idk, girls are so much more, idk, fun? They like to talk about weird stuff which is so much rather talk about than wArFrAmE. 

Do any other males feel like this?
