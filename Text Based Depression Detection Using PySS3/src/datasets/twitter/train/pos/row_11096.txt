Song Snippets (Day 2) [Country Roads] Almost heaven

West Virginia

Blue Ridge Mountains

Shenandoah River

Life is old there

Older than the trees

Younger than the mountains

Growin' like a breeze

COUNTRY ROOOOOADS

TAKE ME HOOOOOOME

TO THE PLAAAAAAAACE

I BELOOOOONG

WEST VIRGINIAAAA

MOUNTAIN MAMAAAA

TAKE ME HOOOOOME

COUNTRY ROOOOOADS
