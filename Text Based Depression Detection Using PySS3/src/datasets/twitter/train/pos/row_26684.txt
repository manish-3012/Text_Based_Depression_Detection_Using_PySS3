Iâ€™m sick of being flat chested... So Iâ€™m a sophomore in high school and besides quarantine Iâ€™m just tired of seeing my gorgeous classmates and girls on TikTok with bigger boobs. Mine are on the small side maybe B on a good day?? I just want to be at least a C. My mom and my sisters are bigger than me they are Cs. I donâ€™t know what to do but I feel like Iâ€™m not in my womanhood or something. Arghhh! Just venting
