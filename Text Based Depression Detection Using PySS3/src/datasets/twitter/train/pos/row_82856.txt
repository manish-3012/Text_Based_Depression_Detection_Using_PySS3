do u ever randomly cry because of suddenly remembering a sad song? I did this last night for some reason and my eyes hurt. I didn't even get any sleep. i still think I'm more than mentally stable but what the fuck was that, I had to smash my face into a pillow to not make any glugglugglug weeping emo sounds. I also cried at school (luckily no one noticed, that would've been an incident) because of THE SAME STUPID FUCKING SONG.

being a dumb hormonal teenager is hard
