I wanna get a tattoo I know the â€œitâ€™s stupid and donâ€™t get one and it will fade etcâ€ please donâ€™t comment any of that cause your just gonna waste your time trying to change my mind. 
I have planned out a tattoo and where I want it. (On my hip/thigh area where it is hidden) I am not going to be super impulsive about this. What items and tools are necassary to make the tattoo look nice and make it clean?
