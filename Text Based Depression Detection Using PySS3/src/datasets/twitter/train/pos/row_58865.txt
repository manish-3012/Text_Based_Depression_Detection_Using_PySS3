I hate the English language Like seriously what is wrong with it? Fireflies are the word opposite of waterfalls, but they are not the literal opposites. And though, through, thorough, thought and throughout make me sick. Why can't we just have a more German like language where we call gloves 'hand shoes' and refrigerators 'cool cupboards'. Are cupboards even cup boards? It's also so inconsistent by region, like how Rhode Island calls water fountains 'Bubblers'. Or how in Australian English, you don't say 'Barry, Harry and Garry are having McDonalds', you say 'Bazza, Hazza and Gazza are having Macca's'. Why was I born in a country where we the language we speak changes, like how I, a brit, calls tea, 'tea', but citizens of Massachusetts call it 'Native American Throwy Material'. Or how Anglophones call opioids 'drugs' but silly old Britain says they are ' our best hope of keeping business booming in Asia'.

And don't get me STARTED on Hiccough. How in the existing hell that we call 2020 is it pronounced 'hiccup'. Or how you could say you were Welsh by just ryplycyng yll yf thy vywyls wyth thy lyttyr 'y'.

&lt;/rant&gt;
