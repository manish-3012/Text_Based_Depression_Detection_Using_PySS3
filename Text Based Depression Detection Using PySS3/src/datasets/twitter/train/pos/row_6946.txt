Literally why. Why do parents always pull up â€œshe thinks sheâ€™s grownâ€ or â€œhe thinks heâ€™s grownâ€ in a an argument. 

If anything thatâ€™s a compliment and itâ€™s better than acting like a 4 year old. Which in some cases some parents do act like children and it annoys me cause my mom literally does it. 

She canâ€™t say please, thank your or excuse me. Itâ€™s always â€œMOVE MOVE MOVEâ€ and when I ask her why canâ€™t she say excuse me, she just says â€œI PAY THE BILLS, I RUN THE SHOW.) last time I checked just because you pay bills doesnâ€™t mean you deserve respect. 

Another thing is with my mom, she expects for me and my other siblings to help her but when I ask for help she doesnâ€™t help me at all. Am I the only one who has this problem?? 

But anyways, why the hell do parents feel the need to not practice the same manners and help their kids.

Some people donâ€™t deserve to be a mom if they canâ€™t help their kids with something and thatâ€™s why so many kids feel like they canâ€™t tell their parents anything. 

Pisses me off so much. You wonder why your kids are being disrespectful, look at yourself. Kids are the spitting image of you and they give what you receive. 

Your parents donâ€™t automatically get the title mom or dad. They earn it. Biologically speaking, yes they are your parents but in another way you have to earn the title mom or dad. 

Iâ€™m tired of this shit for real.
