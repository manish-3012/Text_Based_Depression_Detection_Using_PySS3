If you think about it, dogs and humans have actually evolved perfectly with eachother Centuries ago, dogs helped with hunting, herding, etc. We all know that. But a lot of people will say that "well dogs are just spoiled now they don't do anything haha". But they are a great source of mental support, and that's really helpful in a time where mental health awareness is more important than ever. So really, dogs DO still play a role in society beyond looking cute.
