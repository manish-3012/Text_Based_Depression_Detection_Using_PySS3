Stupid rant 
So tomorrow is the last day of school before spring break so I was having a great day today anyway I come home from school and go upstairs and around 4:30, I come down stairs to get a snack and so I go into the garage to our refrigerator to get a piece of cheese and my sister comes over and locks me in the garage then runs and locks all the other doors and so I get in and I kick her and start kicking her and she kicks me then my mom comes in and ripped my shirt in half starts choking me so I hit her on the arm not hard just the strength of a high five your would give a friend and now she is grounding me all of spring break like this was my fault. So anyway I lost my streak of not cutting myself. Can anyone tell me if I am in the wrong here. For context Iâ€™m 14 and sheâ€™s 16
