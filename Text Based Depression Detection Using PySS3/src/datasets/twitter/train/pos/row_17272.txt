Are my hints obvious? So i like this guy. His best friend is a pretty good friend of mine. I intentionally try to drop hints while talking to her when heâ€™s around too. Iâ€™ll say i love harry styles hair because itâ€™s brown and curly (his hair is also brown and curly). And i just try to point out things i like in guys (basically just describing him). Do you think he is picking up on my hints?
