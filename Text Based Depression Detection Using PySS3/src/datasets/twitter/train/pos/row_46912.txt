Hey Reddit, I know this will perish in new but I need to say something to a person This year Iâ€™ve felt an incredible and undeniable loneliness. Although Iâ€™m considered â€œpopularâ€ and have a lot of friends, I can never seem to more than that with anyone. I live in a country sort of area in Australia and Iâ€™m Christian so finding someone to love just isnâ€™t easy. I know Iâ€™m only 14 (not the â€œthis is deep kindâ€) but I still feel like Iâ€™m behind on the whole relationship part of things

My brother has been dating his girlfriend since he was 15 and my parents started dating at 14 so it feels like I should be looking for someone. Iâ€™ve met people in the past but each comes and goes. Iâ€™m actually really good at talking to girls (Iâ€™m a straight male) but each relationship become plutonic but blissful.

Thatâ€™s all, I feel better knowing that a stranger now knows my problems.

Thank you for reading
