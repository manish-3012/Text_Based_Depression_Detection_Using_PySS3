I have a really weird confession which Iâ€™m scared of telling anyone I lowkey really like how physical pain feels like stomach aches peeling of skin stabbing myself with random items. Itâ€™s not self harm tho because Iâ€™m not depressed and I only do this for pleasure but I canâ€™t tell anyone because they think itâ€™s self harm but itâ€™s not. Ok if you read this thanks and sorry for wasting your time
