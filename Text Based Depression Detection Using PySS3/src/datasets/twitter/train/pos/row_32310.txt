Middle school Man, middle school is just like such a big change from elementary. They should prepare us better. Not a single person is ready for the change. Harder classes, lockers, hormones. It all comes at the worst time and teachers are so unforgiving. They act like we don't have social lives and expect we have hours to do work for them. This is also a rant about how bad the American school system is for forcing tons of useless knowledge into our brains, we spit them out on a test and then repeat for years and years. Anyways that's all I have to say, hope you enjoyed my rant. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!
