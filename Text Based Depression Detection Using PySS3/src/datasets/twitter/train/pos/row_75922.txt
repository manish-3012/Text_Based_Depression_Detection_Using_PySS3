School restriction software So I have always thought my school and itâ€™s employees were technologically incompetent. I was apparently right. 

My school has one of those services that filter stuff on the internet (itâ€™s not very good.) but this one is like, old and bootleg or something, because it has somehow blocked all sights with malware restrictions. Like, if the site has a malware protection site or software protection, or any type of protection, itâ€™s blocked. Which means, ALL social media is blocked, all standard websites, and last but not least. THE SCHOOL WEBSITE. This is also a current issue, as it is still going. Like, anyone doing online school (%85 of the students) cannot access their homework or email. Why does this happen. We arenâ€™t even like a small school either, we are the BEST in our state. Why havenâ€™t they fixed it yet? I canâ€™t get any homework done either.
