I have a really hurtful memory of my mom, a while back when I was going through a lot of shit. I really don't want to explain everything that was going on but it was too much. Although some backstory is needed for the right answer so i'll give a little. With everything that was happening at the time I was the escape goat of the family, and they made me feel horrible to the point I ended up carving into myself and branding myself a monster. Of course this all happened a few years ago, and I was also really depressed. What happened is I opened up about being suicidal to my family and she handed me a knife and said "Oh, we're all waiting for that day". I've wanted to question her about it for soo long, but i'm scared to. She's probably just gonna do what she always does when I mention the past, is act like it never happend and that I live in sunshine and rainbows, I mean she's narcissistic so yeah. Or she'll flip shit and try and say i'm accusing her of shit that never happend. To anyone wondering, no she's not a bad mom she just had a fucked up childhood and we all were going through a lot. No, I don't hate her, she tries really hard to just keep a roof over our head, and would do anything for the family. However she's causes so much stress and pain in my life, but then she turns around and works hard for us, i'm at a mental conflict, on one hand I want to hate her, but on the other hand, she works too hard for us and it feels unfair and selfish. Now i'm getting off topic, back to what I was saying originally, i'm wondering if  I should question her about it. I want too but I feel as if it would just cause more harm than anything. I don know, please someone help me decide.
