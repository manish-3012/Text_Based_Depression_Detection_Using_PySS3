I want to cry, god fucking damnit I want to cry. Growing up being ridiculed for crying, being bullied for it, I've stopped. I don't know exactly when it stopped, but I just didn't cry anymore.

Maybe it's because I don't have an outlet to confide in. Maybe I just need someone to talk to. But guess what? I can't. I can't talk about my problems to someone I know. What if they think I'm pathetic? What if they think I'm weird? What if they think I'm weak? I don't want to be seen as such, so I've refrained. But it's been so fucking long since I've cried my heart out. My heart has cracked, but nothing is escaping. I constantly feel sad, on the verge of a breakdown. But just when I think it's finally going to happen, I'm finally going to release my pent up stress and feelings, I stop myself. 

I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.

Point is, crying is important. If you ever start crying, cry your fucking heart out. Trust me, you'll need it.
