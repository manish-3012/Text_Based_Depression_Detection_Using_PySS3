School Shootings So, right now I'm watching an Anthony Padilla video on school shooting survivors ([https://youtu.be/jSPDgFktZ-U](https://youtu.be/jSPDgFktZ-U)). I didn't really want to watch it but it's good to know people's stories and learn what really happened, what we're going through survivor's minds during the incident.

It just made me think a lot about how anything can happen because our school safety systems are little to none and pretty sure it's worse in other states. People think it's a joke and can never happen to them, but anything can happen. Students went to school that day feeling safe and cared for, but left scarred with heavy heavy impacts on their life. In this one part in the video, this girl was talking about the guy who she was sitting behind was shot and later that night had to be cleaned off of body matter before she went home. She couldn't even hug her mother because she was still 'evidence.' 

I've been in public school for all my life and I never really thought about it until now is that you're never really safe from harm, even in your own home. I just want you to stop and think on this day how lucky and privileged you are. I want you to hug your close relatives because, in this state with coronavirus and school shootings happening at any time, you never know what's going to happen next.
