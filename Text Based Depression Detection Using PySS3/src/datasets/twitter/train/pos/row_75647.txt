My love life hates me more than I hate homework So I ask my crush out, right, in December. She says yes. We plan to go on a bike ride as a date, and there ya go. My cousin (10m) took my bike so he could flirt with his crush (11f). I get dumped due to unrelated reasons the next day, with a promise of dating once said unrelated reasons are solved. Currently, said problems are solved. Weâ€™ve met a shit ton of times irl
