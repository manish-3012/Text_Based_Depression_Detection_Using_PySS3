A guide to understanding sexualities, comparing genders to hot drinks to make it easier to understand: Straight person: I like tea

Gay person: I like coffee

Bi-sexual person: I like coffee and tea (and other drinks) but I like them for different reasons 

Pan-sexual person: I like coffee and tea (and other drinks) and the difference between them doesnâ€™t matter to me

Asexual/aromantic person: I actually donâ€™t like to drink and I donâ€™t need to 

Demi sexual: I only like coffee/tea(demisexuals can be gay, bi, pan, or straight) if I have research on this drink and trust that itâ€™s not poison


If thereâ€™s any other sexualities people want me to add on I can, if this is really helpful I can try and do something like this for different genders. Lmk if I got something wrong
