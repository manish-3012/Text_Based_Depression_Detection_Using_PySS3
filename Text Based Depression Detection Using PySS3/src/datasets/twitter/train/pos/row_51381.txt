What is happening with people becoming gay and transgender?? Okay, so the title itself sounds very offensive. And Iâ€™m sorry for that. I live in a country where that isnâ€™t normal and just following up with the rest of the countries is weird. So to sum all up, I was going through Twitter and noticed a Twitlonger from Faze Ewok. I wondered what the hell was happening because twitlongers arenâ€™t any good. And somehow it appeared that she was now transgender. That fact fucked my brain up. I feel that people are taking this very lightly about their sexuality and stuff and Iâ€™m saying that theyâ€™re taking it lightly because the boy is fucking 14 years old. That isnâ€™t normal for me. And my irl friends agree with me. So, Iâ€™m wondering if somebody from the United States or from any other country that is very well known for their homosexual rights explain me wtf is happening with the people.

Also, the example of Faze Ewok is just an example of sorts and this came up because of him but any other person fits the criteria.
