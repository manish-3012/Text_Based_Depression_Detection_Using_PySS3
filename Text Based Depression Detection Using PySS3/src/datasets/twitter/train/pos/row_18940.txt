Does someone else jiggle with their leg when they're nervous? I'm in a new school and so I really dont know anybody, and my social anxiety makes it worse but whenever someone tries to talk to me or sits next to me I get really nervous and my right leg moves up and down really fast. I cant stop it (it goes away after like 30 seconds or sometimes Minutes)and it makes me even more nervous. Is this a normal thing or am I weird.

Sorry for my english if its not perfect I'm on mobile and not a native speaker.
