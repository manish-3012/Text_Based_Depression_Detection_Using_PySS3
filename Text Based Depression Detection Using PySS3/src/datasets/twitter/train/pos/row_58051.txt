Recommending essential album every day, day 2. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea This is a series of posts I am doing where I recommend albums I consider essential for all music fans to listen to. Also, if you have albums you consider essential it would be great if you could recommend them.

In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is an album that you probably already have heard or at least heard of because of all the praise and memes, and it truly deserves all the praise it gets. I consider the album essential not just because it's my 2nd favorite album ever made, but for the fact that is a rare example of a benchmark in quality for the genre it's in, in this example, indie. This album is heavily associated with the terrible message board 4chan but don't let that turn you away.
