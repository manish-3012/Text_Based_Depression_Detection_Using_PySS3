some1 pls interpret my dream I was in the war except I wasnâ€™t fighting but they made me get in one of them water ball things but it was made of thick glass and there was no air and they rolled me through this warzone in this ball so I could squash all the people and then it switched to me being in the Tate Modern and I had this huge bag of drugs but like tonnes of different drugs powdered down and put in one ziplock bag and then I was like oh shit my antibiotics and it ended okay thankz bye x
