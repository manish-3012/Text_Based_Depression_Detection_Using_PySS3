I lost a bet and have to dress as a bunny for Halloween (I'm a guy) So me and my friend decided to bet on coin flip and the winner would get to pick the losers' costume. She picked tails and was right so she said I have to be a bunny. She says she has a pink dress, tail, ears, and box for me. So tonight marks the end of my life. Wish me luck bois.
