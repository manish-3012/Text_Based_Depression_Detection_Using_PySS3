Introvert and Extrovert relationship? Ok big lads and ladies. 

I known this girl for a while now, but feels like we are from different worlds you know. She's very social, hangs out with a lot of friends and all. And then she also jokes a lot and our humors match quite a lot. Obviously she wouldn't know what I think is fun, or anyone for that matter. I'm an introvert. While I am so, I still talk to a lot of people, have job (struggle) and all. But still, we're very different in many ways. I've wanted to tell her, but at the same time I've just been thinking if I am doing the right thing. I think rejection is a part of life, if that was to happen, I would not be mad, or dissapointed. 


She's 19, I'm 18. She's turning 20 in a month.

Any advice? Would this relationship work?
