A good dating question So now Iâ€™m liking this girl (Iâ€™m a boy and straight) and Iâ€™m trying to idk have some clue if she likes me or not she has been my friend for a year and a half and I just like her a lot and how do I figure out if she likes me back? I already have her skittles for Christmas and been complimenting her for her taste in music and other stuff so whatâ€™s next? She is really nice showing positive attitude for me
