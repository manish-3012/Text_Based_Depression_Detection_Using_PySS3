Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 27 Aw yeah baby, it's that time again. If you have any questions about space or if you'd like to submit a topic for a future fact, leave it in the comments! See ya tomorrow!

Fact:  SpaceX are not the only space organization to have successfully landed and reused a spacecraft. In fact, depending on who you ask, they aren't even the first ones! Technically, NASA became the first people to successfully reuse a spacecraft with the Space Shuttle program. But, the Shuttle had to go through a months-long process of checks and refurbishment before it could fly again, making it only *partially* reusable.   

So....that must mean SpaceX were the first ones to make a *fully* reusable rocket, right? Well, it's complicated. Just a month before SpaceX landed their Falcon 9 for the first time, another space company called Blue Origin (owned by Jeff Bezos) successfully landed their New Shepard rocket and reused it without any refurbishment, becoming the first organization to successfully do so. *However*, New Shepard is a *suborbital* rocket, meaning it can get into space, but doesn't have the power to reach orbit. Therefore, SpaceX became the first organization to successfully create a *fully* reusable, *orbital-class* spacecraft. Which is still a massive feat, by the way. So although SpaceX may not be the first ones to land, let's be honest. They do it better than anyone else. ;)
