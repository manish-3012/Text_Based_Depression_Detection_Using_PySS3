Here's my dumbass rant about what just happened on zoom Sooooooo,

we had a zoom with about three hundered people on it, so three grades of my school, one of them being mine. I was on a facetime with a few of my friends and we were messing around reading people's names wrong. We would turn the camera around and put it on random people on the zoom, as a joke. My dumbass accidentally put the camera on the space bar, and if you don't know, that temporarily unmutes you. So the whole time I was reading this one persons name wrong as a joke, I was unmuted. The worst part is it is one of my mom's friends kids. The entire zoom heard me, and I got like 8 texts after it about what I said. FML im so embarrassed
