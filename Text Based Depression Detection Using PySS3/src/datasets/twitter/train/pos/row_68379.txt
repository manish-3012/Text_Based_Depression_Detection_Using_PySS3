Politics trigger people too badly May God himself forbid anyone say ANYTHING about politics nowadays. It always seems to get people riled up. I'm a even handed sort of guy, trying to give everyone a chance, and looking at the facts. One time I made the (mistake?) of fact checking someone on a lie about Trump, and the person immediately got triggered, and thought I was 'defending' him.

TL:DR Why can't people respect other people's opinions, especially on politics?

And yes, I am a gay conservative. Doesn't mean I'm 'betraying' the community. Cut me a break.
