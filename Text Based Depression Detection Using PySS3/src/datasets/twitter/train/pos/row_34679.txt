Best advice ever Dude, I don't have much time but listen you dumbo.

 If you have any problem ranging from "pimples" to "I am so bad at math, pls help" and to "my gf broke up and I like this girl now, she went to subway in evening yesterday". Just THINK FOR A MINUTE. You won't get much advice on this busy sub. Rather than ASKING A QUESTION AGAIN, try SEARCHING FOR TOP POST WITH SAME PROBLEM. I can bet you will get better replies there...

Please just stop those same lame ass stupid questions. You got brain right. If you haven't, you should be eating grass rn.
