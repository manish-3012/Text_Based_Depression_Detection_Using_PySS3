Umm.. something? Yesterday I made a post that blew up more than I thought and I feel like I fucked up 
Hi Iâ€™m the stupid girl who wanted to find a friend. My post got 18 k upv0tes and loads of aw3rds. I made that post at 1am and went to sleep. To my surprise and horror, the post fucking blew up. I- I didnâ€™t know the consequences. I just wanted an alt thatâ€™s it I didnâ€™t wanna dox him, or anything else. I donâ€™t wanna harm him nor do I wanna harm anyone else. I am fucking 13. What am I gonna do but even if I could I wouldnâ€™t. Yes he was a asshole yes he was rude but I feel bad. I was desperate because I thought he deleted his account because of me. People called me a weirdo,creepy,nut-case. I have plenty of online friends who know Iâ€™m not. I told a irl friend to help and he commented saying I meant no harm. I- I  was feeling really low and now I have crashed to the bottom. I canâ€™t it doesnâ€™t matter. It was my mistake my mistake I fucked up baaadddddddd. Even after this I couldnâ€™t find him. Iâ€™m sorry to everyone who feared for their privacy after reading those comments this one specific comment it broke my heart. Yeah and um I mean no harm. I can send u screenshots of our conversation or read through my comments,and posts. I really have no bad intentions. Please forgive me... Iâ€™m sorry &lt;3 :(
