Really random but I hope my discord friends don't hate me rn, managed to kinda permanently locked myself out of my account for like a week now (long story simplified, my phone charger broke, phone's currently sitting lifeless on my shelf. Had 2 step verification on there and the code is on my phone. No, I cannot sync the code things without doing it on my phone (HOLY FUCK IS THIS SO GODDAMN STUPID AND UNNECESSARILY ANNOYING JUST LINK MY SHIT UP WITH MY EMAIL FFS) ; there's a surprising amount of people that this has happened to so be careful I guess)

Already broke my previous charger back in August and I don't think my mom would be too fond of hearing I broke another, not sure if the problem is with the extension cord since it occasionally sparks inside when I plug the charger in and I'm dumb for excusing it or I'm just really that careless

~~To my friends plez stalk my Reddit page for an understanding why I just left but idk if I'm that important~~

Okay enough sad ranting for me have a nice day byeye
