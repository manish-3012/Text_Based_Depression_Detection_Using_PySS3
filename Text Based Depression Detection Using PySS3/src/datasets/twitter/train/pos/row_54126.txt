Donâ€™t worry itâ€™s just me... your local trans girl who hasnâ€™t shaved in a month, and canâ€™t look in a mirror because of it. If she were to shave she may feel better, but she is too lazy to. I really should, but I never think about it during the day, and donâ€™t have the time to do it at night.
