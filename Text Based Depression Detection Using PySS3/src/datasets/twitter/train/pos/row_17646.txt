I'm thinking of asking this girl out but I'm having seconds thoughts Ok so I've known this girl for a while now and I am fairly certain she has feelings for me too because of a few things I've noticed. For example, she goes for physical contacts, she sit next to me in class so sometimes she just randomly punch me in the thigh (it's like a tease so it doesn't hurt), she change the tone of her voice around me, she laugh at my crappy jokes and I somehow got to hold her hand this one time which she didn't mind, it lasted longer than it should've.

I actually have no clue if she's just being really nice or she's obviously telling me that she likes me.

I need some advices from ya'll or atleast some encouragements so I'll have enough confidence to tell her how I feel.

Thanks for reading.
