I just realized this... It is entirely possible that famous people like Billie Eilish, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown, etc. might be on this sub! They're all under 19 which means they are allowed on this sub and it's hard to swallow that they might not know about Reddit. 

So if any of these guys happens to read this post just know that we love you with all our hearts. We are really big fans and keep it up.... 

That's all.....
