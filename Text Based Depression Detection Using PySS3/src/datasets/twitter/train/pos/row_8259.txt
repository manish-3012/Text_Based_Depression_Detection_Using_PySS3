Does Reddit use more or less data than youtube? My parents turn off my wifi at night so I have to use my phones mobile hotspot so that I can use the internet at night. However, last month my mobile hotspot ran out really quick cause I watched a lot of youtube. I don't want that to happen again so I'm using reddit. Do that use less data than youtube?
