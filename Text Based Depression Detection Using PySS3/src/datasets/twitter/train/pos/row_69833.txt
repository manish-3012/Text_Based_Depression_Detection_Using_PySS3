this is a message to all of the teenagers struggling with body image issues, eds, and self confidence issues. im currently pretty much recovered from an ed i developed around a year ago and im finally starting to be happy and accepting of the way i am and my weight. im here to tell you that the journey of recovering from an ed isnt easy but it's so worth it. you have to learn that your own perception of how you look is more often than not warped and its not a true representation of how other people see you. im not just saying this as some bullshit, i have body dysmorphia and really struggled with body image issues. i know it seems counter intuitive but you cant just take everything your brain says at face value because it doesn't perceive you accurately. slowly but surely i moved away from focusing on the negative things i saw about myself and people had said to me out of spite and learning to reinforce the positive things. im not saying its easy but it is very much possible. even if nobody else believes in you i do and i wish you the best of luck in your recovery. another important thing i have to mention is that the majority of how people perceive you comes from how you act and carry yourself not your appearance. i wish you the best of luck
