What do you all think? I just bought a light blue blazer because I like dressing up but I was wondering if I would be overdressed. Not that I care too much about a few judgemental looks but I don't want everyone to think that I feel like I'm better than them just because I dress nice. Do you get that impression whenever you see a teenager dressing up?
