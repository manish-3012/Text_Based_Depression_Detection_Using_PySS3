In two days, all of Scotland goes into tier 4 lockdown. This means every non essential shop will be closed, and that nobody can travel. You can meet up with one person outside. And I'm going back to school on the 18th of January at the earliest, which means I'll have to do online learning for a week before it (The holidays would've normally ended on the 11th, but we get another week off)
