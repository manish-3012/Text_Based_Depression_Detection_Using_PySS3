Someone in my school passed away this morning I didnâ€™t even know him that well. I knew OF him, but I wasnâ€™t close with him in any way. Itâ€™s still...jarring though. Iâ€™m only in high school. I kind of forgot that we werenâ€™t invincible. We can still die of heart complications even if weâ€™re young. My heart aches for his friends and family. I canâ€™t even imagine losing someone close to me. Hug your families, tell your friends you love them (even if it sounds weird. Do it. Trust me), and cherish every moment youâ€™re still here.
