Secrets shall be revealed here today people ask how I got so much karma with such a low age account so heres the secret

Go to r/pics or r/PoliticalHumor and post a picture of a minority (Eg Homeless, black, mexican) making a statement against trump, this statement can be on twitter ([I used this one](https://i.redd.it/46m6mwqavft41.png)) You cannot use twitter on r/pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as I used a homeless sign, before you do this ensure they cant check your profile and see you are active on a sub like r/PoliticalCompassMemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and dont even defend your self (I made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics)

If you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards, if this doesn't work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will. 

You can also use r/politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time

You may also use r/blackpeopletwitter and find a black guy making fun of trump, this one will also usually work

And once you have gotten all that karma and awards you delete that shit so it doesn't stain your account and you can easily do it again, have fun!
