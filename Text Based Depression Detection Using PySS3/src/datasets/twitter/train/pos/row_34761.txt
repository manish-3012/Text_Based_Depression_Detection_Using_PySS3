This generation is too sensitive. Now I know this may be a controversial take, but hear me out. And also before you say â€œok boomerâ€ Iâ€™m a teenager 


This generation canâ€™t take any jokes. If someone makes a slightly dark joke they automatically them to be racist. Do you not know what a joke is?


This generation also doesnâ€™t understand the concept of â€œdifferent ideasâ€ 
Eg. If someone says that trans doesnâ€™t really make sense as you canâ€™t magically change your gender just like you canâ€™t magically change your age, they are automatically assumed to be transphobic or someone who spreads hate speech.


The final problem with this generation is they seem to hold lgbtq people to a higher regard then anyone else. Now, if youâ€™re lgbtq, then thatâ€™s fine, be who you want to be. But if you come and tell me that youâ€™re lgbtq and therefore more valuable and a better person then me just because youâ€™re lgbtq then youâ€™re objectively wrong.
