I want to quit football but my parents wonâ€™t let me I thought this would be a good place to post this sense Iâ€™m sure someone else has been in my boat before. 
So I want to quit football Iâ€™ve played it sense 5th grade and havenâ€™t enjoyed it at all this year the season is about to start and I want out. I told my parents many of times this summer I didnâ€™t wanna play and they still wouldnâ€™t let me. Now Iâ€™ve been asking everyday if I can quit because I just donâ€™t enjoy it anymore and hate it. My dad however is highly against quiting in any fashion and wonâ€™t let me quit at all. So any advice on what to do to get out? Iâ€™m worried if I just quit without their permission theyâ€™ll screw me over and ground me or something.
