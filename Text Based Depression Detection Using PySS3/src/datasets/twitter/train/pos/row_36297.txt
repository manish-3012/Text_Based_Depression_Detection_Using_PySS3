School sucks Yeah, if I'm right gimme an award &gt;:(

jk...but I'm right tho. I mean, you surely know the feeling, when u studied the whole damn night till the morning for an exam but you know that all the effort was just useless.
I mean u already know you'll gonna fail. Yea plz hype me up...I have an exam in 6 hours...and I'm screwed.

Distance learning just makes everything worse...you can't really concentrate on what the teacher is talking, you fail every class because you get too distracted or you just dont meet the deadlines. It just sucks.

(I don't wanna fail)
