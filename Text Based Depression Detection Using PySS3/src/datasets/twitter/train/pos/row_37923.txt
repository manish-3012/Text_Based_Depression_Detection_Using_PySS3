My cat can't speak cat. I have recently learned that the cat we brought in had not been around it's mother enough, and hadn't learned how to do the communications with other cats. It's mother allegedly died, because it kept showing up on my brother's friends porch, with no parent in sight. We already had a cat, so we took her in, and we only now learned that she literally cannot speak to the other cat. That's why shes suuuper close with the dog.
