If you think about it furries are just weirder weebs Furries are very similar to weebs. Weebs watch/read a lot anime and manga. Furries Watch a lot of anthropomorphic animal (anthros) animations and look at furry art. Some Weebs may draw anime characters and possibly cosplay as them. Some furries draw furries and may cosplay as them. Some Weebs jack off to hentai. Some furries may jack off to yiff (Anthro pron). Thereâ€™s also a lot more similarities. Like furries also watch a lot of anime like BNA and Beastars (Really fuckin good anime though. Highly recommended).
