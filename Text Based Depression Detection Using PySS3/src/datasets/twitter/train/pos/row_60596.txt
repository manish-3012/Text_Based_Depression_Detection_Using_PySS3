I like messaging random people and asking them what their opinion on pegging is It's always an interesting conversation starter, you never know how they'll respond. Sometimes you get the standard "wtf", more spicy responses that roast your ass for daring to ask the question, the innocent soul who just googled it and found out what pegging is, men of culture who go into detail over how much they *love* pegging, or even intellectuals who wanna go full on into debate over whether or not it's gay for a woman to fuck a man with a strap-on dildo

If you're tired of text convos that go like "Hey", "wyd", "nothing much", "ok cool", ask someone what their opinion on pegging is
