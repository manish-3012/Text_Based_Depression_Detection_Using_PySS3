Story: 
My family and I met him in late 2014. My siblings were like kids in Christmas morning as soon as we saw him. He was good buddy and an old family friend. We played with him all the time and we cherished memories with him. All the games we played and all the nights we spent together since we met him. This morning, He was healthy as an athlete because he did not have any breathing problems when we played together along with my siblings. then, my brother and I encountered the most heartbreaking moment unlike any other. We stopped hearing and seeing from him so we rushed and rushed as fast as we can to get any answers but all we heard were beeps  and then the beeping sound stopped while reviving him, realizing that it was no use to resurrect him. He was pronounced dead by 7:30:28 PM PST. Our hearts broken and silence was among us. Oh how time flies fast, that we must spend every second, minute, and hour with our loved one. To my ol buddy, a part of my childhood, a family friend, and my gaming buddy. Rest in peace ;( 

Iâ€™ll need time to process this so Iâ€™ll be offline for a couple of days mourning his passing.
