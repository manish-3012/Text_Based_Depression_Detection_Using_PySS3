The first day of high school is coming back into my brain. I'm going to be a sophomore this year, and it's crazy how I'm already 25% through high school. I had no clue what I was doing the first day, I literally used the longest possible path to my school in the morning (I walked) because I didn't know any shortcuts, I didn't know where my first class was, and I felt so out of place.

Idk it's a weird feeling.
