my rabbit has an abscess under her neck I just was looking at my rabbit and i notice something under her neck. All of the fur there is missing and thereâ€™s pus or something idk. I donâ€™t know what to do and i donâ€™t want her to be in pain. Iâ€™m afraid to tell my mom. Iâ€™m literally broke and vets are expensive as hell, so i donâ€™t know what to do.
