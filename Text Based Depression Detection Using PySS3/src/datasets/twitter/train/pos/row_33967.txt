I think my best friend might hurt themselves or worse and idk what to do. As the title says I think my friend my hurt themselves and I think it's leaning closer to the worse category. 

He's been going through a lot recently his parents except him to be perfect in everything he does because he is a victim of the gifted kids program and he also has a diagnosed anxiety problem so that isn't helping. I'm scared recently he has become more open about it which is a good thing but I also think it's getting worse each day he has a therapist but he claims it isn't working.

He's probably reading this and mad that I'm posting this but I don't know what to do anymore. I care about him a lot he I genuinely consider him family and losing him would completely ruin my life. I love him a lot and I want to help but I don't know how please if anyone has any advice please tell me how I can help.

sorry for posting this I'm just scared.
