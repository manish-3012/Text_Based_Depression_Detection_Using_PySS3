My favorite part of day My favorite part of day is this. It all starts when the red whoosh goes â€œwhoosh!â€ in the sky. This is around 1400 in my time, which I cannot reveal for the spooky anonymous purposes. I go out of the lawn and into the kitchen, for I must search. I search the cupboards. I know what must find. The Beans. I find the beans, the yummy beans and the apricots. I get them from the cupboards and I eat, I eat the yummy beans and the apricots. Then I also know what next must I must do. I go tiptoe. I go â€œtip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip tip toe. Tip tip toe. Toe toe tip.â€ I tiptoe to the corner of the kitchen, where the kitchen meets the living room. And then I must that there is no one around check, for I am to be a no-no.  I do this check by saying â€œ the shush!â€ And then I make the noise, for it is the time for to do the noise make. I make the noise and I go â€œChraech! Chraech!â€. Two Chraech is best for the task, though why the Chraech and why two I know of not. Then my favorite part of favorite part. I squat down and I do the poop. Five hours later, I always come back and check, and I think that is the poop of the dog. So does my mom, which is why I must do the check by saying â€œthe shushâ€ so I do not be found. Then, I go to sleep and do all again on next day.
