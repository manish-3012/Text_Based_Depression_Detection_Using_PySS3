I think my art class is actually making me start hating art For the entire first half of the school year, the art teacher didn't teach us ANYTHING in class. He just gave us art assignments and we'd send him our progress and he'd go "you should change this" without actually giving us anything about how to put together a piece.

Now, he's suddenly gone full-on class mode. We're having study guides and note sheets for vocabulary about composition. I was not prepared for the sudden switch and now I'm falling behind because I don't know how all the right words to use for constructive criticism of other people's artwork. It was like the entire first semester I learned nothing because he refused to teach, now he's teaching so hard that I can't keep up.

You wanna know what else? My dad is super on my case about making sure I get a good grade for art, but he also says that art is a stupid subject with no real-world applications and he chastises me if he sees me doodling on paper (Not for my art assignment, but it's still practice, right? And it's how I like to de-stress anyways). WHY DO YOU YELL AT ME FOR DRAWING AND THEN YELL AT ME FOR NOT DOING GOOD IN ART HOW DO I MAKE YOU HAPPY
