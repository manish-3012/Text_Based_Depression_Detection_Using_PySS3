I have been up for 32 hours and I am still not sleepy. Anyone else have this same problem frequently? For the record, Longest I've gone is a little over 40 hrs without sleep. 

If anyone has any easy fixes I'd love to hear them.

Or if you also have this same issue and just want to share your experience I'd love to hear that too.
