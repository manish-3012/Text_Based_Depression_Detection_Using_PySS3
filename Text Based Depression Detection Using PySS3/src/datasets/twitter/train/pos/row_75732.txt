I swam with a shark. So, I just got back from my short vacation. I live in Malaysia, and I went to a small island called 'Lang Tengah'. This took place on the last day of my holiday. 

The main activity on this island was snorkeling, due to it's abundance of aquatic life. 

I was swimming around this formation of corals. There were a crap ton of fish there, including Parrotfish. I was just swimming around casually, getting surrounded by the fish, when I took a glance to my left.  

About... let's say a car's length away from me (or perhaps 6-8 feet away), I saw a shark swimming towards the coral formation. To be precise, it was a Blacktip Reef shark. It was a young one, about 3 feet long. I instantly called to my dad, who was another few feet away from me. He was with my younger brother, too. They both looked up, and saw the shark swimming away from the coral formation and right past them. Needless to say, my younger brother was scared shitless, and he wanted my dad to take him back up to the surface (my dad was kinda surprised too lol). Meanwhile, I myself wanted to go after the shark, which swam away. 

My dad stopped me, and said that even a shark at that length could be dangerous. I reluctantly agreed, and we returned to shore.  

So yeah, that'll be a story to tell my grandkids ome day. I swam with a shark in the water
