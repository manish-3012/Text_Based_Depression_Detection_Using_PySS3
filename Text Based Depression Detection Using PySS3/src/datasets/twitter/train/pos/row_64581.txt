My granny died recently but I think I'm more annoyed than anything else. My granny died of covid about a month ago now, we all got it but she had it worse and passed away in hospital, but to be honest, I don't care and I don't know if I'm actually happy about it or just pissed off.Â 

So here's the story, my granny used to abuse me and blatantly favored my sister over me.Â 

I'll give you an example. When my great grandad died years ago and long story short I was going to go to the funeral, I wanted to and that was fine my sister didn't want to or cared until she found out I wanted to go and the day before we went she asked my granny only one of use could go and I was kick-off.Â 

Here's the example of some of the abuse that would happen, I and my sister would fight sometimes, sometimes it would be because I have ADHD and I get hyper-energetic, even tapping my leg while I was sitting would annoy her Iâ€™d get in trouble for tapping my leg. But anyway here's the story, I was excited doing my usual bouncing around while playing with something, my sister decided she wanted it, but I wouldn't give it to her she went to my granny and my granny forced me to give it to her and then forced me to sit outside in the winter rain for hours, in an Irish winter, if I moved I got in trouble until my grandad got back.Â 

This stuff used to happen a lot normally not physical abuse but it had happened. Towards the end of her life, she went insane with dementia and some other undiagnosed issues, I had to look after her but she didn't remember any of the bad stuff she did and acted so friendly towards me I hated it.Â 

So then she died and funerals are expensive where I live I was forced to go and *record it* my mom wanted me to record it but never mind that but now we can't afford to get my mouth fixed so my thoughts are confused and conflicted

Tldr: abusive granny died now annouyed I can't get braces.
