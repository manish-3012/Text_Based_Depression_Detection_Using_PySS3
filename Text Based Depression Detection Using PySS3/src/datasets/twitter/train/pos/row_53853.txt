I feel a little bit conflicted So, my friend got this girlfriend recently, and what I found out, was he cheated on her with one of my friends (the friend he cheated with had no clue and was high).  Well the friend he cheated with asked me to get her in contact with the girlfriend, and I did, but I feel like it wasnâ€™t my business to interfere. Should I have not helped tell the girlfriend? Should I have confronted my friend and gotten him to tell the girlfriend himself? I donâ€™t know man. I really have no idea, and I honestly just need to rant/get advice, so if yall got any wisdom, Im all ears :/
