I have begun a weight loss journey. Iâ€™m going on 15 5â€™9 and weighed 220 pounds two days ago. Iâ€™m now 213 and have a dream weight of 180-190 pounds.I hoping by the end of spring I will be there. I just feel like I need a little support or something so I donâ€™t get doubtful. I already feel better eating less and eating healthier foods. Wish me luck!
