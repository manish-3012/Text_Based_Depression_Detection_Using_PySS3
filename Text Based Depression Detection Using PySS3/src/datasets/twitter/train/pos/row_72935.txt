Insulting Christianity isn't OK. Calling God a "magic sky daddy" is very rude and offensive. I'm tired of people believing that it is OK. I know its hard to understand but religion is very important to some people, so belittling it could make someone feel very hurt. This behaviour is in fact hypocrisy. If someone told a member of LGBT that all LGBT is a bunch of baloney, they would be very hurt. LGBT is almost a part of their lives. So why is it OK to do it to Christians? It's becoming harder to say your a Christian because people will just start berating you.
