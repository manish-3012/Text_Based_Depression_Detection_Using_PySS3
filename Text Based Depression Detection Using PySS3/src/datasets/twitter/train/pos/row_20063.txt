First Kiss I am 18 years old and i have not had my first kiss yet. Am I too late? All of my friends have already done it a long time ago, but not me. I watched this video that stresed me out a lot. It said that the average age of first kiss is at 15 years old. Hopefully, I will do it very soon, I just kind of want to check it of my list if you understand what I mean.
