I legit hate my grandparents My grandma took away the air conditioner, in the middle of ARIZONA. The reason they took it away was bullshit too. They say I â€œtOuChEd ThE tHErMoStAtâ€ which i fucking didnâ€™t, Iâ€™m okay with my 72 degrees. Iâ€™m legit dying of fucking heatstroke in my own god damn house. Itâ€™s like 83 in the house which is really fucking high for me, I have a singular ceiling fan to help, which really ainâ€™t doing shit. I need another fan but they refuse to give one to me. Iâ€™ve taken like 3 cold ass showers today which only give me temporary relief. 

Please. Fucking. Help.
