How much karma you need to post here? Alt has over 100 and still won't let me post. And could you check this text that I wanted to post there for any gramatical mistakes? Thanks &lt;3 "I'm sorry

Mum,  please don't blame yourself. It was not your fault, you loved me so  much. You tried to give me the best life. But it wasn't enough.

This is my decision. I decided I don't wanna live anymore. I wasn't heavily bullied, no. I am the only one responsible for this.

Maybe now you'll be proud of me. Now maybe I'll be praised for the things I've done. Maybe now it won't be take for granted.

I  wanted to die. I wanted to end this suffering. My mind was hell. But I  don't blame you for not noticing. It's completely my fault.

Please,  I'm better now, for sure. Whether it's those pills and alcohol in me,  or the noose around my neck, I'm better now (please excuse the cuts on  my forearms (wrists? Palms? Elbows? please help me what is the part rom  your elbow to your palm called, thanks), they're not your fault either)

I'm  sorry I probably won't be a politician like you wanted me to be. I'm  sorry I'm not the best in school. Other kids were always better than me.

If you find this, I'm probably somewhere better. It's not your fault.

I'm sorry"
