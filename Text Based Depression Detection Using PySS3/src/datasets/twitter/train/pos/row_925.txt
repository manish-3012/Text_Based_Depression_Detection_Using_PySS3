Any one else like this Ok so last night I had a dream which is a very rare occurrence for me, but the dream was about a girl and I fell in love with the girl. This isn't the first time I've had this dream a couple of times before with the same girl but her eye, hair, and skin color changes. I've never seen her full face so I have no clue what she looks like,and we somehow always find each other even if the dream isn't about her, but I guess the dreams are real nice to have when I only dream once every blue moon.
