I don't judge y'all for your absolutely horrible taste in what you find attractive, so stop hating on me. Yes, i like furries. No, i don't want to fuck animals. Call me furfag all you want, i don't care. 

Y'all act like i chose to be this way. I didn't.


Also, there is too many posts about boys in skirts. Fucking stop.
