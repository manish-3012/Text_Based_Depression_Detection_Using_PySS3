Is a 18 year old senior dating a 16 year old junior weird? Long story short; I have been texting a girl who is younger than me, who has feelings for me and I for her. I just turned 18, so I donâ€™t want to come off as weird or sad for dating a 16 year old. Itâ€™s not illegal in my state, but I just want to get a general consensus from you guys. Is it okay to pursue her, or should I back off?
