I just cussed out my mom For context, she's an alcoholic and likes to hide bottles of whiskey around the house. I would be fine with her drinking if she wasn't such an asswipe when she did it. She slanders others and then acts like she's the victim, calling random people in her contacts and starts cussing them out and accusing them of thinking she's a bad mom and other shit. I'm a very patient person and I try my best to not be an asshole to my mom because I really really care about her. 
She says that she drinks to calm herself down but it does the exact opposite and puts everybody on edge. You might say: why not talk to her? The thing is that she doesn't fucking LISTEN. She promises me she'll stop but it's always a lie. She bounces between guys and blames them for causing the break up when in reality, it's her addiction. 
We move SO FUCKING MUCH because of this and I can't handle it anymore. As I said before, I'm very patient and try my best to be understanding but I can't anymore. She does this thing where she accuses me of thinking she's a bad mom, today when I started screaming at her she tried to pull that card and I told her she's an awful mom, I called her a piece of shit no good alcoholic. 
It felt so good to lose it on her but I also feel bad. She tried to get physical and push me down the stairs and out of the house but I pushed her against the wall and spit in her face with a couple more insults. 
TLDR, I feel like shit man
