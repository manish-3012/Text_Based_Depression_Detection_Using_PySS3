Hey guys (and girls) As you all know, todayâ€™s my special day.
Iâ€™m a bit sad, as I invited you to my party and no one showed up except my grandma, who gave me a whopper and said eat, before your dad sees :D
I also have math and gov homework.  
I would just like to say that this sub has been a really great place to hang out in. I learned some stuff and used it in actual life. Thanks for that 
Keep it up
Hereâ€™s some tips I learned from you
-Do your homework first and get it out of the way so you can chill the rest of the day 
-eat on a normal schedule 
-get a reasonable amount of sleep every night 
-even if you donâ€™t feel like it, take a shower and put on a fresh pair of clothes every morning
-fill your life with happiness 
-make some friends 
-ffs, donâ€™t get in trouble with the law or something. That kind of stuff will follow you the rest of your life
-(guys) donâ€™t get anyone pregnant underage. It brings a fudge ton of consequences with it. If your just â€˜playin aroundâ€™ or really want to bang ffs use a condom
-(girls) watch your back. There was this creepy old guy trying to go for a 15yo. Just watch out. Thereâ€™s always those people.
