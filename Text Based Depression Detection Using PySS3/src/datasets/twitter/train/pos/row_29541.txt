Let me explain how it's more gay to not have sex with a guy then to have sex with a guy once. Okay so let me explain.


So y'know how if you don't try something then you don't know if you'll like it, well basically it goes for the same as sexuality.


Okay so for example, lets say you see this item at a store and it says pickle pops and you think "ewww gross i don't want to eat that" well then you don't know if you like it or not you're just judging on appearance and not how it would feel inside your mouth, but let's say you do try it and you love it, same thing goes for being gay or not.


So what I'm saying is you never know if you're actually gay unless you have sex with someone of the same gender. So therefore you're actually less gay if you done it with someone the same gender and didn't like it then not do it at all!!


Thanks for coming to my ted talk!!!
