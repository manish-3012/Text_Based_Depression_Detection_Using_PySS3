Why does this matter? Iâ€™m sick of seeing people getting picked on for their height. NO ONE CAN CONTROL GENETICS. A guy posted on here earlier saying he got made fun of by a bunch of 13 year olds because of his height. It shouldnâ€™t matter, whether youâ€™re short, tall, or average. As long as youâ€™re not a pedo/rapist/homophobe/racist/anything else in that category, youâ€™re ok in my book.
