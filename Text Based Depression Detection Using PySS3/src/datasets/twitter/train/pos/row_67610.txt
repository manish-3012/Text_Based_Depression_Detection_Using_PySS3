This is the best social media platform So I had face book too many Karenâ€™s for me

Twitter I just didnâ€™t feel the vibe

Tik tok do I even have to say anything 

Instagram so I still have it but I have noticed that They have very dumb opinions and are assholes if u openly disagree.  (Iâ€™m semy overweight and I made one post saying that I was proud of my weight loss. And someone looked at it at said â€œyour still a fat little bitchâ€. All bc I like one basketball team more than another)
