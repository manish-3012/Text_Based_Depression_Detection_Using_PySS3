Disappointed in myself So I decided to goto a park close to my nanas with my little cousins, just to watch them and I thought â€œWhat the hell why notâ€ so I get there and climb up a tree. A few minutes later a girl my age, her little sister and a brother around her age (I think). Well they walked over and made a joke and were gonna walk away but then ended up staying and attempted to talk to me, but I got shy and didnâ€™t really say much back other than telling them where I went to school. I started to pay more attention later on and the girl kept looking at me whenever I looked down at my phone. I thought I should talk to her but kept getting scared. They eventually left and I never got to attempt and have a conversation with her. Even though I didnâ€™t know her I kinda started to like her. So here I am sitting in bed at 12Am when I can be asleep nonstop thinking about her.
