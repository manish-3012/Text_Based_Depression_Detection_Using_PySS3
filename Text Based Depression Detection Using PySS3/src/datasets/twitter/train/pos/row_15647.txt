my step brother got the virus no this isnâ€™t a troll lol, he tested positive and now i have to quarantine for two weeks after i just started school again and was able to see my friends again. i also canâ€™t go to practice for 2 weeks which arguably sucks even more. everyone in my house is being affected obv, ik iâ€™m not the only one. i guess i should just try to look for the good in all of this. welp, thatâ€™s it, i just wanted to get it off my chest. iâ€™m kinda of scared that my friends and team mates are gonna treat me like some plague rat when i come back.
