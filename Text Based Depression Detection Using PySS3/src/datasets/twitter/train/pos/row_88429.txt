fuck my ex, man, seriously She broke up with me in July and it fucked me up hard. She was my first everything. And she left out of nowhere.

Finally when i decide to date again and i'm feeling better. i actually got feelings for another girl again and i've forgotten about my ex.

Now a month into that those feelings dwindled and we stopped dating. Whenever id listen to a love song it was still my ex i pictured in the passenger seat. It felt like surface level feelings for the girl i was dating, yet deep down i still just wanted my ex.

She livin rent free in my head ffs. 

Now i'm scared it'll never fade. I loved her so much and i'm worried if i try to date anyone else the same thing will happen and i'll end up wasting the new girl's time.

Seriously fuck her. Over 6 months and she's still running in my head whenever i listen to music that i happened to listen to at the time.

But hey, she's doing just fucking fine on her own.

This whole post has been very aggressive against her but she hasn't really done anything, just that it pisses me off how much i've let her ruin me.
