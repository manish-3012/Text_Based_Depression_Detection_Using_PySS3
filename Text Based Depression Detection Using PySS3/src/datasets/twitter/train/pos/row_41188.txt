I accidently caused that, by a year older girl has a crush on me. I need help, and who better could help me than bunch of deppresed teenage strangers.

So I (m14) was on Pioneer camp like every year, and we, like always, had dancing "party" at the end. I am part of this group, that is same age as me, boys and girls mixed. Mostly are here always partly normal songs and partly slow songs, where we dance in pairs. I danced with one girl from that group, which is mostly introvert and doesn't often talk with us as a group. But you could say we are friends so when she wanted me to dance with her, i was absolutely alright with it. Then i danced with her practically till the end of the party. Through the evening, i started thinking about what if we'll be together, like for the first time ever, cause tbh, everyone, including me, mostly shiped her with my best friend. She is smart, she is pretty, yeah kinda hot too and she mostly has the same hobbys and personality, as me. But I am still other than her. She doesn't enjoy just being with friends, which Is for me the best way to be happy. She isn't romantic type. I am. My thoughts ended undecided. At the end of last song, she kissed me on cheek. I was really surprised, but i think my previous thoughts prevented me from doing something thoughtless. I think i made a discordant face. She apologiesed and than the party ended, so we all went to bed. Next day we were cleaning up and preparing for outgoing from camp. She send me this letter by some kid. The letter was like this:

I'm sorry for what happened yesterday. I promise i won't do it again, so please don't be mad at me.

I then found her and told her I'm not mad at her, i just didn't expect it. I know i should've said more, but i didn't feel like it. When we were leaving, we hugged for goodbye.

I have contact to her and i don't know if i should start dating with her. I just can't decide. That's why I'm here.
