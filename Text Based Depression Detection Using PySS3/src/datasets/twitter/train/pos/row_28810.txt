So i like this girl right And i want to ask her out but idk if she likes me or not. We're best friends, she's amazing and beautiful, but she did get out of a relationship like a month and a half ago. She was the one who decided to break up with the other person, but still is it early to ask her. Ive already told her that i really like her 3 times while she was dating that other person. Don't ask why, ik it was a stupid decision on my part. What should i do fellow teens of reddit.
