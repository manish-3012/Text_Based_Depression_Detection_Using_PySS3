Welp I wanna die Ya wanna know whats worse than not having friends in the first place? Having ones you thought you could trust and losing them all.

This girl led me on for several months only to find out that she began dating my best friend a month ago and they purposely hid it from me. When I didn't wanna be friends with him anymore, which he told me he knew was gonna happen I might add, I effectively lost all but one of my friends in a matter of hours.

The worst part is they hid it from me because they thought I'd go berserk and try to get revenge or some shit, they begged me not to harass them. This alone makes me sad because I never get angry outside of xbox, it just meant neither of them actually knew me. My other friends even actively helped them get together and hid it from me to prevent me from "going psycho". Once again ive never been violent or had anger issues, I can't even remember a time i was angry with either of them. Man I'm not mad I'm just depressed.

My former best friend told me its my fault because I never texted her during quarantine (or at least not as much as she liked). Even though I was going through a serious depression and was dealing with family issues, so even if I had the courage I didn't have the time.

All this happened a few days ago and I'm still in shock. I feel betrayed, lied to, humiliated, and vilified. This shits gonna follow me for the rest of high school, I'm gonna have to see these people everyday. I honestly wanna kill myself because of how painful this is.
