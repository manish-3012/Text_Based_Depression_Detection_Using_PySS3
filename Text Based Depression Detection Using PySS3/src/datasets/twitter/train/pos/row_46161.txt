Time to get sad WARNING: Im about to get sad, not suicidal, but sad. So if you dont wanna see a 14yr old be sad, go away. Ok, now thats taken care of.

For the past year or something, I havent really been in a good self confidence state. Considering Im a 5'6 14yr old with a small gap in his front 2 teeth, Im not feeling too good.

I havent had a real relationship in A WHILE. And heres the bad part, in my past 5 relationships or so, they ALL changed their sexualities. Am I that bad of a boyfriend. Am I really that ugly...
