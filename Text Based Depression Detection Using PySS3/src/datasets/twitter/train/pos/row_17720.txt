Hi, I'm new here! Mind if I share my experiences as a teenager? ^^ As a kid, I wanted to grow up and become a teenager so that I could do the fun things like what my older cousin does(hanging out with friends and going to places to bond with friends). My parents won't allow me to do that when I was a kid cuz they say that I'm too young for those stuffs. I didn't have many friends I can play with when I was a kid and I was inside the house most of the time since my parents were overprotective. And I can't make a move until my parents give permission.

I'm not really happy becoming a teenager. I'm bored as always. I haven't done the things I've been dreaming to do. I grew up becoming an introvert and until now I'm still staying inside the house most of the time. I consider myself a failure cuz my grades are pretty low and I know my parents aren't happy about it. 

I just want to share this with y'all because I'm bored. I'm 16 btw.
