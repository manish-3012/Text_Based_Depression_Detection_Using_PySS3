Any other teen feel like their classmates donâ€™t really like them and leave them out of certain activities? Call me an edge lord or whatever the fuck but sometimes i feel left out of most of the people in my schools conversations, hang outs, jokes. Almost like that one scene in The Office where they purposely donâ€™t invite Micheal to the party at Jims. Same with a lot of conversations as well (this is probably just me being awkward but its not too bad to try to talk about it, right?) almost like if i try to join in on a convo with a more well known student, it seems awkward like i shouldnâ€™t be talking to them because iâ€™m a person in the lower ranks of the popularity scale (which is a bs method that sucks but for some reason i still feel bad about it.) and if i fuck up or anything, iâ€™ll be the laughing stock and probably be made fun of for one sly, sneaky, slip up. This might just be me but maybe not.

If you wanna share your opinion on this or anything, reply. Iâ€™m glad to read it!
