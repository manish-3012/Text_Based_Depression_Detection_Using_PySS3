I feel lost, homesick, and alone. I recently moved from Oregon to Utah. I've pretty much just begun unpacking and I'm adjusting slowly but surely, but I've felt myself feeling worse and more irritable than I did back in OR. I have no friends here, or family, snd everything is so different. Just had to rant.
