I'm fed up with the song "joy to the world" already Title text. I've already heard it in SIX FUCKING ADS and it's not even thanksgiving. Like would you CALM YOUR TITS WITH THE CHRISTMAS MUSIC IT'S NOT EVEN SNOWING YET. I'm tired of the holiday spirit being shoveled down my throat prematurely. And no, old navy, I will not buy *jingle jammies*, whatever the fuck those are.
