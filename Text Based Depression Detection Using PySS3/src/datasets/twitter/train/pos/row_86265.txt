Guys... I am literally crying right now... So I am a big big procrastnator, Sir dosentdoshituntilll1minutedone.. Well, today, it finally happened.. I have been doing really badly in school lately with the new learning system, and having just being quartined due to close contact, I have been locked in my room for almost a week in counting, (with daily food and restroom abilities), and I havnet done SHIT. I just completed all my stuff.... and I am crying right now. My mom just popped off on me about how its all my fault that I didnt do shit, and I cant really argue with her... my only real exusce is that I procrastinate like crazy, and that I really need help. BUT OF COURSE I DIDNT SAY THAT BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO HAVE THAT KIND OF CONVO NOW DO I-

Anyways...

Yeah, drowning in my sowrrows.
