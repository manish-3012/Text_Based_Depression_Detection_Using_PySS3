Iâ€™m gonna lose my fucking mind Why the fuck does EVERY. FUCKING. THING. that has to do with tech have to be so god damn confusing? Why the fuck are there hundreds of videos explaining how to use Excel, but every single one of them is outdated? Why can I not make a basic fucking graph like a functional human being?

Pro tip in case any of you guys have kids, donâ€™t raise them to never use technology, in a world that is rapidly becoming more and more dependent on technology, and kids have the knowhow to build entire fucking computers
