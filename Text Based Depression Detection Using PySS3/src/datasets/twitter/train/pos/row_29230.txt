Fuck math class I had a test today and I could of made a good grade. The only thing is a question only has 4 parts and the teacher is taking them all for one question, 10 points each. Well first of all, it was geometry, labeling points, so if you get one wrong all of it is wrong, and second off, I think you know where this is going. Science I fucked up on the one question, I made a 60, over one question. 

Fuck this class, I'm bored line on my grade god damnit
