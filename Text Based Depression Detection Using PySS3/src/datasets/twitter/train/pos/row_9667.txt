LGBT community, I need your help iâ€™m a straight dude, but most of my friends arenâ€™t. i love them all and itâ€™s nice. but iâ€™m not very informed about different orientations and stuff so i feel like iâ€™m letting them down. could you guys give me a crash course on everything lgbt? 

also i apologize if iâ€™m not using the correct terms. i donâ€™t even know if iâ€™m supposed to write lgbt or lgbtq. 

please help.
