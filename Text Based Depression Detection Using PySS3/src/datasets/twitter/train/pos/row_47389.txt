How is my post about cute boys still blowing up lol https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jtgli0/intelligent_boys_are_pretty_cute/

It was legit just a shitpost where I was thinking about cute boys who are so interested in their PC gaming stuff that it's cute when they talk about it. Then there's like 700 of the same comment like "babe i know CPUs and RAM ðŸ˜" or some shit like that lmaoo. Also like none of them know I'm gay.
