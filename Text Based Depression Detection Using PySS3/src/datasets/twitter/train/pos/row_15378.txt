I Feel horrible So a few minutes ago, i was trying to do schoolwork and make memes, just now i went on snap to see one of my close friends story, when i saw what they posted i felt so horrible. Her cat is going to be put down at 5:00 today unless they pay the vet $1,052. i really want to help and i can't and i really feel like the worst dude in the planet right now.
