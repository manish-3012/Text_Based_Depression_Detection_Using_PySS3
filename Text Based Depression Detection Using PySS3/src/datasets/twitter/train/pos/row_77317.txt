Fellow Teens, I need your advice. Today is my crush's birthday. I usually don't send DMs to people for their birthday unless they are family, close/best friends, or someone real special. If she gets a message from me when I don't usually do this, how will she react? I want to subtly make her aware that I care about her without being creepy or sus or whatever. Teens, what do I do?

Edit: She seemed really happy!!!!
