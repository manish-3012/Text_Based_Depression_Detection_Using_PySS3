Iâ€™m so scared to go to school today I have this Dutch book I have to finish writing in every like three days. I havenâ€™t done any of it yet. And it has to be done by 2:30. Iâ€™m freaking out because no way in hell am I finishing it even if I do nothing else but it today. I donâ€™t want my dutch teacher to get mad at me or anything.
