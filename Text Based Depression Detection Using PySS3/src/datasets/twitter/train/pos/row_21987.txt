Okay, random thing I remembered I was in a discord group chat once with now my gf and a couple of my ex friends except my one Portuguese friend.

So the chat got silent because we werenâ€™t sure what to talk about then out of nowhere my Portuguese friend joins the chat and starts yelling. The best mental portrayal would be an angry Latino Mom bursting down the doors to a room with a chancla and yelling at her child


I just started laughing while my girlfriend got scared, not because itâ€™s something she experienced but it was so unexpected that it was hilarious and for her it was scary.


Idk I just remembered this and Iâ€™m getting sad again since I lost contact with that one friend
