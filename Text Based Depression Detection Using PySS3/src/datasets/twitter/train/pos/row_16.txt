My school sucks. I try to prevent generating waste, but it seems impossible when even when I BRING MY OWN REUSABLE MASK, MY SCHOOL GIVES ME 2 MANDATORY DISPOSABLE MASKS. I can't give them away, I can't do anything with them, and 2 OF MY SIBLINGS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL AS WELL. DOING BASIC MATH SAYS I GET 30 DISPOSABLE MASKS A WEEK. I hate this.
