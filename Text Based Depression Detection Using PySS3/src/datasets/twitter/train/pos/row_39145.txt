Could my parents not fight for one god damn day? Every single day I swear to god there is something else. Like seriously. Every single day. Earlier today my dad was getting ready to go to work and he asked my mom â€œwhere is my walletâ€ for about the 15th time. And for about the 15th time my mom said â€œI donâ€™t know. Where did you last have it?â€ At this point my mom was getting annoyed with my dad so she kinda had that tone. My dad went â€œFine. Fine. Iâ€™ll find it myself if youâ€™re gonna be all pissy like that.â€ My mom went â€œWHAT?â€ And boom, massive screaming match ensues. Eventually my mom storms out. My dad is left huffing around mumbling stuff under his breath about how maybe heâ€™ll just stay at work and how at least they like him there (he does this shit after every fight they have) and at this point I kinda tired of hearing it so I just shrug. My dad goes â€œWhat? WHAT DO YOU WANT?â€ And I just go â€œoh nothing dadâ€ and walk back to my room. Yeah. Thatâ€™s just about every day anymore. This shit is getting ridiculous.
