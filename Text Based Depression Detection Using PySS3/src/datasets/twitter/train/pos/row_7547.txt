My passive-aggressive e-mail to my teacher Hi friends,

So, my aunt has decided that the best way to motivate me to do homework is to claim that I've lied to her about when I have school, claim that I've missed almost all my online classes (I haven't), and claim that my dad doesn't love me because I don't do schoolwork. In my haste and aggression, I sent the following e-mail to my teacher:  


&gt;Hi Ms,  
&gt;  
&gt;Can you please confirm that the class is at 12:00PM so that my aunt believes me and doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m lying to skip online class?  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, have I missed any classes so far? I canâ€™t remember and my aunt seems to think she knows my schedule better than me :)  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!  
&gt;

Fortunately, my teacher took it well and confirmed that she did indeed change the time of my class from 10:00 to 12:00. My aunt still doesn't believe me but that's alright - I just hope my teacher got a good laugh out of my passive-aggressive e-mail.

Bye for now :)
