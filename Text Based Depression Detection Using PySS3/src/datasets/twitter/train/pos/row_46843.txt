I have to go to school even though Iâ€™m quarantined My brother got COVID and we are still quarantined for 2 more days. My Vice principal called and said she changed her mind and I can go to school. Iâ€™m at risk of giving COVID to my class mates and itâ€™s because of her. I have the choice to stay home but I will probably be punished. Should I go?
