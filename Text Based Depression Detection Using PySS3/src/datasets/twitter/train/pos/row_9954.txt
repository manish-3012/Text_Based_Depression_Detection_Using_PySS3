WE WERE JUST IMFORMED THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IN LEVEL 2!!!!! Ok, so in my city there are 3 levels. 1 just like normal except for Friday which we do online schooling, 2 they split us up in half so a-k go Monday and Tuesday everyone else goes Wednesday to Thursday, and finally 3 all online schooling. 

       I AM FUCKING PISSED! I will hardly be with any of my friends.
