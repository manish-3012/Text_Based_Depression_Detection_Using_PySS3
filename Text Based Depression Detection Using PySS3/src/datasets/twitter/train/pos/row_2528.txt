How to masturbate (for men) You really don't have to masturbate if you don't want to, no actual benefits.

But if you do want to, here is how to do it (can't believe I'm typing this but let's go):

There are 2 methods for male masturbation (there is anal, but I have never done it and I am not knowledged in the slightest about it):

Standing and laying (however, you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing, it's just refering to how they are most commonly performed).

First (for all), find some time to do it.

I suggest getting about 30 minutes of free time.

Then, find someplace where your semen won't be a problem, and **isn't shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with**.

Then, get something to clean it.

A good wipe will do.

You can then find something to do it to.

It doesn't have to be porn or lewd, doesn't even have to be a picture, you can even use your imagination (although keep in mind - it's easy to get distracted).

Then do it in hours when you won't fall asleep during the masturbation (sadly, I am guilty of that one).

Also do it fully naked.

You don't want stains on your clothes.

You can also use a form of lubrication, but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation.

**Now on how to do the standing method:**

Get in a comfortable position, then undress yourself.

Get a grasp of your penis in your palm, and start stroking it.

As gentle, rough or however you feel like.

Don't worry - no harm will be done to your foreskin.

Just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate.

That, really is it all.

**Now on how to do the laying method:**

Undress yourself, and find a soft object.

Then, just rub your penis (or your entire body) on that object until you ejaculate.

Keep in mind that that object WILL get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it.

That's pretty much it.

Now, if you don't know what ejaculation feels like, don't worry, you'll know it when it happens.

If you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like "fresh out of the penis", break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid.

Imagine this, but white.

Now, sperm is going to be sticky, smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger (don't ask how I know the last one, and don't attempt to taste it).

And that's it.

Now go on and masturbate.
