A hot cheeto girl probably kept me from self harming today. In my first period which is always loud and chaotic I was crying under my hoodie because life is hard rn. I like to think I hide it pretty well, but this loud hot cheeto girl taps my shoulder and says â€œwhatâ€™s wrong boo?â€ I have no friends and no shame when it comes to being depressed anymore so I just told her everything and she says in front of everyone. â€œBaby youâ€™re beautiful as hell and donâ€™t let nobody tell you otherwise, and you got the prettiest eyes on this damn earth, too pretty to be cryingâ€ thatâ€™s probably going to stick with me my entire life. I doubt iâ€™ll ever forget it. That meant more than the entire world to me.
