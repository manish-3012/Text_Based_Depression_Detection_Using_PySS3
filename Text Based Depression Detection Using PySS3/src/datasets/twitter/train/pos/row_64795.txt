(Poem) â€œVoyageâ€ 

We look towards the endless 

Blue and blue as far as one can see

Her size creates a frightfulness 

That only experienced people can truly believe 

-

We look towards the horizon

Where there is only sky and sea 

And our minds fully envision 

The things that wait to be 

-

The sinister storm will smile 

The waves will be higher

And the raging wind will howl 

As we go farther and farther 

- 

Into the abyss weâ€™ll go 

Like weâ€™ve done before 

And meet the hell we all know 

As we sail her once more
