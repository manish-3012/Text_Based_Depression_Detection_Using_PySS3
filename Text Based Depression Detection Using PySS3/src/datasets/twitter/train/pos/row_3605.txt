Assholes makes me wanna quit basketball I (14M) was playing basketball earlier today and was missing most of my shots (awful day shooting), and my court is in the middle of a main avenue with a lot of traffic and a neighborhood road. I was playing by myself waiting for my friends to get there and play 2v2. All of a sudden i shot the worst shot of the day and completely airballed. A red car drives by with around 3 people in it and they roll down theyâ€™re window and tell me I suck ass and other insults, like calling me a bitchass whiteboy. this broke me

There is probably 600 cars driving by me everyday and the thought of all of them thinking I suck dick makes me not wanna play at all. I am officially insecure and have lost nearly all motivation to get better at basketball. Iâ€™ve been wanting a personal hoop, but I donâ€™t have the money and the community center is closed, so Iâ€™m stuck with the very open, public double rim court.
