Just had sleep paralysis that shit was scary as fuck I am fucking scared to go back to bed and close my eyes because I WILL be paralyzed and have visions of scary things. I need to stop this. I think itâ€™s because of going on my phone too much in bed oh fuck. And I feel like my mind is on survival mode because Iâ€™m in a lot of fear right now so someone help
