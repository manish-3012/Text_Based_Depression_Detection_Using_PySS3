Petition to replace NNN with FFF I am serious here. I come before all of you with a plan. The greatest of all. I propose that we replace No Nut November with my own invention. Fap Free February. I have an argument I would like to present to all the fine men and (if they're real) women of this subreddit.

No Nut November is a good invention, but it is inherently flawed. So, my proposal of Fap Free February is in my opinion an improvement.

Pros:
February is the shortest month

Masturbation is what people really think of when they think of NNN. My new month has a better name

Relationships don't get neglected. I'm sure many women are rather displeased at the fact their boyfriend/husband/fiancee/whatever doesn't have sex with them for 30 days (or 4, or 10, depending on their will)

February is the start of spring. November is the middle of fall. In November there is less sunlight and less to do, and it is colder. This leads people to have less Vitamin D and spend lots of time indoors. It would be easier to abstain during spring

Cons: 
February is the shortest month, so you achieve less of a karmic state upon completion as you are 1 or 2 days less than in November.
