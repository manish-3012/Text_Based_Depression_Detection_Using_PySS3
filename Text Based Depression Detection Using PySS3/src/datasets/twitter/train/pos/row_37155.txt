I get nothing in my birthday So I am 14m and I am going to turn 15 on my birthday this time. But none of my family members just care about it. I have a sister who is 3 years smaller than me but gets everything she asks and because of which she got a bad attitude and also takes my stuff away and my parents not even telling her a word for it. When my birthday comes, I always wish for something good but at last I get nothing which I really like. I never ask for something to my parents whole year. So I expect something good in my birthday. But they are not even considering my birthday and takes out thousand cons all the time if I ask for something and which makes me stop asking for something and then they decide to give gifts by themselves which I don't like at all. Every year they convince not to celebrate my birthday which would cost a bit. This has been happening to me since 11.
