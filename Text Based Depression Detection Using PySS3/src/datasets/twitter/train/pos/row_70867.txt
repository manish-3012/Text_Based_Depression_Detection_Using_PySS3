one of the dumbest dumb stories I'll ever tell It all started in 2nd grade when my teacher asked me if I took a bath the night before. I can't remember what I said but I think i told my parents she asked me this. She kept asking me this and soon other kids caught on to it. Other kids would ask me this just to piss me off. Which of course my parents weren't happy with. They eventually stopped doing it until it started again in 4th grade. It got to the point to where they took me to the office so the teacher could tell the whole class to stop this. Ironically the teacher who started it and the teacher who ended it both has the last name "Ferguson".
