Urgent. There has been an explosion in Beirut, Lebanon. Please forgive for the vague title. I am still figuring if it was a terrorist attack or an accident. But we need to come together as a world together to mourn those who lost their lives in the explosions and maybe help those who are injured. I am deeply disheartened by the news but that's what we as the future of the world need to address. Fellows, I know this hasn't been a good year so far and I know many of you too have suffered through these times. That's why I consider it our duty to help those in need and in pain. Please do whatever you can to spread the news. (Indian media seems to be only involved in their political shenanigans and I hate them for it.) So if you are from India please share it. And if my Lebanese friends are reading this, we are with you guys and forever will be.
