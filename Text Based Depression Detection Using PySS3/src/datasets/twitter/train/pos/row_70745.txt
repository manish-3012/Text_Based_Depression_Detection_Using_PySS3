I Can be a Dreamer Since sometime i felt bad with myself, Keeping the constant Thoughts of being forgotten, being left, not being enought abs other things my body Shape and my work un the Last year of High School. 

Today it is the day number 5 of consecutive Happiness, I probably changed or matured a Little Bit, but if you feel like what I Felt before, keep going, things turn out to be better, I am happy and gonna find new friends when the summer break ends , new hobbies, new place to study, college and ,Maybe with some luck, a loved one too, Today is the start of my new life
