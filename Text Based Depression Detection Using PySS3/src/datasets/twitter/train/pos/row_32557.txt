i am wanting to buy geometry dash full version on my phone, but i use the same account on my phone as on my chromebook, if i purchase full version, does that mean i can play on the same account on my phone and on my chromebook? or do i need to purchase it twice and make 2 different accounts? (i flaired this other cuz i didnt know where it else should fit)
