I think my crush likes me So in the past few weeks my crush is constsntly commenting what I do like "Great job" or when I was answering "How are you doing" and stuff.

Then today she said "is there anything you can't do"

She either *does* have a but of sarcasm in it or my introvert ass just thinks she doesn't like me.

No, she doesn't do this to anyomne else.
