There's nothing we can really do to fight transphobia and it hurts. 
Like I just wrote a long Reddit post about my thoughts on some transphobic shit but I know nobody is going to read it or care so I deleted it, transphobes will just common on it and completely discredit what I'm saying while gaining upv*tes from other transphobes.

Trans people always have to just shut up and move on because nobody takes any of the issues seriously and it only gets worse
