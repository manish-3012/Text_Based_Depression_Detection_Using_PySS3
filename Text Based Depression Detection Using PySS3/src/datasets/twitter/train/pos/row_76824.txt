the guy i rejected wants to be friends... so this guy from my school dmd me a while back telling me he liked me and wanted to get to know me better. i went a long with it wanting to see where things would go, but i have extremely conservative parents and had to hide it from them. doing so have me extreme anxiety and the guy just wasnâ€™t worth it because i didnâ€™t like him and he was a racist. so i told him i didnâ€™t wanna take things any further and ended things. he messaged me again today asking to be friends and i said yes because i panicked. iâ€™ve been so anxious all day and i donâ€™t know what to do. has anyone got any advice?
