I wish my girlfriends parents werenâ€™t so overprotective Yesterday I went on a date with her at the mall ate some Panda Express, etc

Her dad questioned her apparently about who she was with ,so he took her phone and messaged me , now heâ€™s going to put shit on her phone to know what sheâ€™s doing, he already has a damn tracker on her already, sheâ€™s barely a few months younger than me
