I did the math to how much every award costs together To buy every award it costs 102,540 coins. I live in Ireland so I worked out to buy the minimum required coins it would cost â‚¬290.33 ($342.01) but I did the math using the American prices and it costs $199.98  (â‚¬167.76) which is close to half the original price I got. It costs more to buy coins with euro than US dollars even though a dollar is worth 0.85 euro. I would like if people in the comments could get the price for their currency ( I used 2 40k coins 3 7,200 coins and 2 500 coin packages ) tldr I did the math and it costs half as much money to buy every award with dollars instead of euros
