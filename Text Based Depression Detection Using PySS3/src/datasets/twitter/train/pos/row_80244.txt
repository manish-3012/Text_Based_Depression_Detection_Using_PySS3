My mom and dad is going out to pick up my brother at my grandma's house, and my cousin's family came to our house not 10 minutes ago and I don't know what to do with them I hate them. She treated my aunt like crap so that's why I hate them. I don't know what brings them here but my mom told me they're coming over to visit. Even though, my mom and dad knows why she's treating her family(from my dad's side) like crap, I don't know why they're still letting them visit us
