Iâ€™m sorry but Iâ€™ve seen a couple of posts/comments saying this and I hate it Theyâ€™re saying shit like â€œgirls need to give us more signalsâ€ and the like. 

Okay so what Iâ€™m understanding here, is that guys are too scared to give signals so girls should have to? Thatâ€™s not fair at all imo. 

Am I not understanding it right?
