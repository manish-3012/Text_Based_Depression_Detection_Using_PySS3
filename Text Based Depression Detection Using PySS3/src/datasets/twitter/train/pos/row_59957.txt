Iâ€™m feeling pretty frustrated today Online school started for me last Monday and it was going well for the most part, I just missed a couple of classes. Itâ€™s currently Labor Day weekend here in the US so we get a couple of days off this week. Tomorrow is one of those days. I suffer from depression and anxiety, as well as a minor case of anorexia where I skip as many meals as possible such as breakfast and lunch. My parentâ€™s donâ€™t know this about me, so they just assume Iâ€™m lazy. Recently I was watching Breaking Bad, a show they had no prior problems with until that point, when they told me I couldnâ€™t watch it but still used my Netflix profile to watch. I went to bed annoyed, seeing as how that show and video games are the only things that really keep me happy anymore. The next day they told me I couldnâ€™t play video games for the next 2 days. Iâ€™m pretty upset because they took away the things that kept me happy and motivated but whatever. I guess Iâ€™ll be ok.
