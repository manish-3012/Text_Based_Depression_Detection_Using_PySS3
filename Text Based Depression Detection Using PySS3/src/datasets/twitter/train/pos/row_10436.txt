Modern pop sucks and im tired of acting like it doesn't So around 2016 there was a noticable noticeable decline in music quality and shit music started to rise, now when ever there's a pop song its normally someone mumbling with autotune on how they got laid. music got less happy less complex and people put in less effort. I would take 2000 to 2015 music over this shit anyday. Seriously i miss happy pop music with semi hidden innuendos instead of cardi b talking about her ass. What also sucks is over half the songs people listen are about not giving a shit, and dont care for others, seriously music has gotten worse on how it sounds, its story as a song, and its message.
