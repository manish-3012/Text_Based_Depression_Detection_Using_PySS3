How hard are GCSEâ€™s? (Level 4 / C) Hello, I was wondering how others feel about the GCSEâ€™s ; mainly focusing on English lit + Lang, maths and double science 

I understand everyone will provide different answers but I would just like a general opinion.

To be more specific ; how hard is to achieve roughly a grade C / 4 on the mentioned topics above.

Any other advice or revision tips would help
