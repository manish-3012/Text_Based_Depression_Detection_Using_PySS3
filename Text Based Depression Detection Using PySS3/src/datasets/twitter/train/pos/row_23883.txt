I messed up lmao I took a screenshot of the hw answers and the teacher said: i know someone took a screenshot and can he reveal himself, i said: sir it was me. 
He said: congrats u can copy the answers but dont send it to anyone. 

5 mins later: everyone wants me to send them a copy.

Now ppl are like: its ok if u dont want to send.
 
But we all know its not ok lmao

Ill get into trouble if i send it tho. 
Im stuck between sending it or not cuz itll mean i get into trouble.

F it. I aint sending it.
