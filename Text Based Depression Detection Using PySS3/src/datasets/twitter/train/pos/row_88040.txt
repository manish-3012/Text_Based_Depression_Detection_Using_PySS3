Guys, I figured out why Chemistry and Biology are important! They can be used to help sci-fi writing

But in all seriousness if I wasnâ€™t learning about chemistry, my sci-fi concept of Ionized Metals would be wrong completely. Now ionized metals in my fictional universe that Iâ€™m creating are highly energized forms of basic elements such as iron and gold. These elements through ionization wouldâ€™ve gained different properties. For example gold-ionized energy would lead to stuff turning gold, then exploding. Another would be iron bonding with all metals and make them able to cut through anything. With my previously new knowledge, I now know I really need to explain the difference between a regular ion and the kind of Ionized energy Iâ€™m creating
