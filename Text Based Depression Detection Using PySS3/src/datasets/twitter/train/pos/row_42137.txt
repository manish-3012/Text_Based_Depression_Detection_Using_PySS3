Cough, when you accidentally break a rule in another subreddit. Someone has been messaging me, and I have been replying to their messages.  
But then I reread the rules and realized I completely skipped over one.  


"We do not allow people to request, offer, solicit, encourage, express an openness to, or ask for others to message them.".  


I blocked them. So, do I report it to the mods or do I just leave it?
