Advice from a normal human: I need your help. Hello fellow human beings. This is the not demon. I have noticed something concerning.  I have noticed that a fellow nice human that is not kept in a laboratory has made a post on the internet. 

I need you fellow kind human beings on the planet earth to help me find out who it is. Please fellow kind human beings, help me find out who the human being that is not kept in a laboratory is. I will grant you an amazing award by the name of â€œa Reddit awardâ€ (I think that is what the human beings care about...). 

Thank you kind fellow human beings. Nothing will come to harm to the human being that posted on my account. Ha. Ha. Ha. They will certainly be alive after I find them. Ha. Ha. Ha.

P.S. I keep seeing with my eyes a fellow human being called u/MegaThiccc that is everywhere... perhaps this kind human can help me find out who was the human that posted on my account?
