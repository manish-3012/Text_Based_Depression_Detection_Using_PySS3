good morning to... (pt 3) (i forgot to do goodnight to pt 3) people who stay in their rooms all day because they hate their family but have no friends and even if they had friends they would have no freedom to go out with them, people who can't moderate their love and end up becoming obsessed with people, people who have 98+ on their rice purity score (good on you:3), people who listen to bedroom pop, people who went through an art hoe obsessed with sunflowers amd tyler the creator phase in 2017, people who have snakes as pets, people who are obsessed with their face, people who hate their face, people who wear baggy jeans and doc martens, i luv u all.
