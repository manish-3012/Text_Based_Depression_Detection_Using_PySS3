I literally wanna kill myself bruhðŸ˜­ Like this just might be it I'm so done. All I do is starve myself and then binge eat and work. I work at a family owned  car wash until 6pm or so and by then I'm so tired I can't even enjoy myself

I wake up at 5am every.single.fucking.day to clean the floor at a restaurant I'm so tired. I do schoolwork and by then it's already 9pm

I don't have a home my friends left me I'm so done I wanna die I'm so fat I can't. I'm 15 Im wasting my teenage years I hate my life.
