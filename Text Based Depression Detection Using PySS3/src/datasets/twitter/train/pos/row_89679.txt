i literally just want to give up itâ€™s too hard and i canâ€™t keep up with everything anymore. friends are too hard to keep, sports are too hard to improve in, school is too much for my head, i canâ€™t do it anymore. iâ€™ve been trying so hard recently, not even to mention i hate literally everything about myself. my parents both have their own problems and take it out on me and i donâ€™t want to do it anymore
