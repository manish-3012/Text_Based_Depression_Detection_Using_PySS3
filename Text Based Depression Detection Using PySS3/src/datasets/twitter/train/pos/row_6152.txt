Good morning Iâ€™m crying about crabs I just found out that if a hermit crab finds a bigger shell itâ€™ll explore it and see if itâ€™ll fit and if the shell is too big, it will wait by the shell for up to 8 hours as other crabs come along and try it out. As they realize itâ€™s too big for them as well, they queue up next to the shell and form a line from biggest crab to smallest and wait for the crab that is the perfect fit and then THEY ALL EXCHANGE SHELLS IN SEQUENCE SO EVERYONE GETS A NEW HOME. Omg
