The day I peed my pants in kindergarten You might be wondering "why are you telling me this?" The reason I'm telling you this is because I need to get it off my chest and I also want to make some people laugh, so here I go.

(Sorry if I have some spelling mistakes I'm not to good)

so it all started during nap time, around 11-12 in the morning. I needed to go to the bathroom but there was a person in there. And everytime someone got out, someone went in immediately. Me being the person not to ask for stuff just waited till nobody went in the bathroom, but people were not stopping from going in immediately after someone got out. So about 7 minutes later someone was taking a long time in the bathroom and I pretty much dancing at this point. So my body pretty much said "I cant hold it in anymore." And boom, I peed my pants. I felt relief but then I realised " oh I'm not in the bathroom, and my pants aren't down." I just stared around with everyone looking at me thinking "what have I done." After that the teacher took me down to the principal's office and in the office I put my head inside my shirt and waited for what felt like over an hour. What did I gain from this event? Introvertness, I dont know if that's a word but it is now.

Thanks for reading this story kind person, I hope you have a good rest of your day!
