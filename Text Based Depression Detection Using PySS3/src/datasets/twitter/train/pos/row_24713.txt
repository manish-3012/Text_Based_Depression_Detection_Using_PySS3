Iâ€™m just wondering whatâ€™s a normal amount to eat in a day I donâ€™t eat a lot of food and feel disgusting when I do. I really donâ€™t know why because Iâ€™m a little bit underweight. I donâ€™t eat breakfast and usually throw out most of my lunch, then eat dinner with my family. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m not hungry, Iâ€™m always really hungry, Iâ€™d just rather be hungry than feel terrible. I donâ€™t think this is normal.
