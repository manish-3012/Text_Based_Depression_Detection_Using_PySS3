I can officially say that I am extroverted! This might sound kind of weird but I used to be pretty introverted in the past but what I've been doing is forcing myself to act like an extrovert even if I'm uncomfortable with it

I'll say hi to people I walk by on the street, I make myself introduce myself to new people and make new friends and I've been trying to go out with people from school rather than sitting at home like I would normally do

Now, after about 3 years of me doing this I can officially say that I am no longer super uncomfortable with social interactions and I've even become one of the more popular guys at my high school

I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with being introverted I'm just sharing this accomplishment that I'm really proud of, I definitely like the extroverted life a lot more but I can see how it isn't for everyone
