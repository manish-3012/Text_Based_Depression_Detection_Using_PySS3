Its difficult dealing with rejections, but im finding it extra bit difficult... Many guys can overcome relationship(s) rejections very easily or well show as though it never happened but i am unable to do that. If i like this girl, she will always be on my mind... and makes me sad as i know im not the right guy for her and shes deserves better. 

I asked a friend of mine how he deals with rejections and he's response was "i move on man, onto the next.. It happens..." but me i cant get into that frame. Its though i fall into love deeply before any interaction. This happened once, this happens many times. I see a girl regularly, i fall for her, never have the courage to interact with her, time goes by and its over... we never see each other ever again. 

I kick myself for not interacting with her but at the same time, im just like well, i aint even up to her high standards, she will eventually someone better than me... 

Im the sort of the guy that keeps all my love towards certain people inside of me until it slowly fades away (i still love them) but because i no longer see them. This keeps happening. 
I dont know. Imma leave it to you people... 

Peace
