I did adult stuff with my ex I  went to holidays with my family and some family friends one of wich  happens to be my ex's fam. We lived in a flat, slept in the same room and we got drunk so we decided it would be a one-time-thing and only  physical. Well then we did unspeakeable things to each other and went to sleep. It wasn't weird so we did it again the second night (without the getting drunk part this time).

Then, on the day of driving home again, we went to a museum and then I (or  we?) massively fucked up. We hold hands and hugged and did all these great couple things we used to do when we were still together.

And  then we drove home in seperate cars. We wrote a bit but nothing  important just some jokes and stuff. Now I really don't know how to feel cuz the museum stuff obviously wasn't just physical or a one time thing  and the story of how we got together was quite similar.

Is this nostalgia? Does she like me? Why do I suddenly feel this weird feeling about her? Can this even work?
