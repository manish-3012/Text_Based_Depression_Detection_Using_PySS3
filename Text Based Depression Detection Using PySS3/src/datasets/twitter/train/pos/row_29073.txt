Need help finding a good fully online school to go to As the title says, I need help finding a good online school to go to. Over the past 8 months iâ€™ve been doing full online in my regular high school and i realized that i think i just work better like this than being in person, preferable iâ€™d like to go to one that is mostly just independent work and barley and interaction with my teachers if that makes any sense?  Iâ€™ve come to realize i get more stuff done if i can just do it by myself whenever i want and ask the teacher for helps sometimes. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks :)
