This has been really weird Like every single week day these past 2 months  would wake up at 7:45, eat a waffle, cry, get a blanket, sitting on my ass for 8 hours, doing any homework I need, then going to sleep for an hour or two, waking up and eating dinner, then go back to sleep. But now that I'm on a break I have 0 idea what to do
