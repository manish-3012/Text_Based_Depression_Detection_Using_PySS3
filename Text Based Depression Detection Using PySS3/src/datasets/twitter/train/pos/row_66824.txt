I need help choosing a gift for my best friend Itâ€™s as simple as that, and I know that I should know what she would like since she is my best friend, but I really donâ€™t know. If anyone could help, I want something thoughtful and really nice, and preferably through Amazon. Off the top of my head I know she likes Candles and Disney, but I want something more personal. Thanks for reading ðŸ¥° 

P.s Iâ€™m a guy &amp; gay and sheâ€™s my best friend so no Iâ€™m not trying to get her to love meâ¤ï¸
