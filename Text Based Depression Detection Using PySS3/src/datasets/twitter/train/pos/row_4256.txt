â€œWe dont pick favorites,â€ My parents say. My sister can beat me with a stick because i try to say hi to my friend that my sister and her friend are on ft with. My sister can make me try and trip so i fall down the stairs and im the one who gets yelled at when i point it out to my parents. I poke my sister with the end of a pool noodle and i get grounded and â€œspankedâ€ with a fucking cutting board. But my sister could do the same thing with a knife and my parents would do nothing. My sister hangs out with friends outside of school regularly but the one time i ask for a friend to come over in 3 FUCKING YEARS, i get told no, why cant you just do it over facetime.

But we dont pick favorites so this entire fucking argument is invalid â€œbecause i said so and thats all the why you need.â€
