I'm giving up on math and computer science Yeah that's right,  you heard me.  My teacher told me to calculate a prism and I used a different (easier)  way to get a correct answer and not waste more energy.  She was not impressed. C'mon I discovered that way my self b*tch, is that not impressive to you. Why you need me to divide the answer by two and multiply two again, you insane.?
