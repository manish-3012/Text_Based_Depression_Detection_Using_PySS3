I saw a cute girl today i was just visiting her house (we've known each other for abt 3 weeks) and the moment i stepped into the door this happened

Her: "Oh hi!"

Me: *head turns into an old timey work whistle, steam comes out of my face as the whistle turns bright red, eyes pop out, jaw drops to floor, tongue rolls out like a carpet, rolls tongue back up into mouth like cigar, tries to pick up jaw but cant, is forced to operate heavy machinery to place jaw back into correct place, kazoo noise as my heart pounds off my chest so hard it becomes visible through clothing, pupils turns into bright red hearts, grabs hammer and hits self upside the head with it, i am forced to re-do my hair as the hammer messed it up, clears throat, pounds own hand in chest, swallows own spit, regains composure* "you look quite lovely!"
