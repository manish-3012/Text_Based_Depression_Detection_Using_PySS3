i think my best friend committed suicide today i went home from school and found a text by my best friend. it wasn't a rare thing. the problem is that the text pretty much  looked like a suicide letter and was from 3 hours before. i imediately wrote him lots of messages trying to stop her. she still hasn't answered and i'm crying because i would never forgive myself for not helping her if she killed herself.  my bf tried to help me distract myself from what happened but it was pretty much useless. i'm incredibly scared and i wanted to talk about it with you all redditors. i'm not asking for karma or awards, i just want to distract myself a bit
