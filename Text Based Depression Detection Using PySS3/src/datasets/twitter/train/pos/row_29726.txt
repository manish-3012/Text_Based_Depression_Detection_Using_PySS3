Seeing your best friend in a horrible state of hopelessness, fatigue, and pain is so horrible. Iâ€™m so tired of suicide among young men dude. It happens so fucking often. My friend is in recovery right now and may never walk again. Heâ€™s lost 40 pounds in a month. Itâ€™s fucking awful. It brings me so much pain to see him in that state. Guys, please support your guy friends, no matter what you or them think. I stg please do it.
