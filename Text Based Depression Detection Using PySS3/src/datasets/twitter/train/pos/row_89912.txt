I wrote a song Idk where to share this sooo  
Thereâ€™s a divide in my heart

Iâ€™m falling apart

Do you really love me

Do I really love you

Iâ€™m trying to face facts

But I just canâ€™t go back

Do you really want me

Do I really want you

Is it worth thinking about this (Thinking about this thinking about this)

Is it worth Talking about this (Talking about this Talking about this)

Do I need someone 

Do I need someone to hold

I canâ€™t really tell the difference between lovers and friends anymore

Lovers and friends anymore

Lovers and friends anymore

Lovers lovers lovers lovers

Lovers or friends anymore

Youâ€™re the source of this the ever lasting thought of this

Some people are a hit or a miss but when Iâ€™m with you I feel pure bliss

Was this really my wish? To find true love in the midst of a

Bad day when nothing went right that I told you about a million times

I canâ€™t really tell the difference between lovers and friends anymore

Lovers and friends anymore

Lovers and friends anymore

Lovers lovers lovers lovers

So please tell me if weâ€™re lovers or friends anymore  


A lot of this is missing the notes of whatâ€™s going on in the song so imagine the music yourself. Iâ€™m just really proud of this
