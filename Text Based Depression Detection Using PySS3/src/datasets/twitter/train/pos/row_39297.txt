Something got wrong this year. So... as we all know, 2020 has been hella exhausting right? 
But if we take a look what is happening on the internet... BOI WHat the duck is happening here?! 
I get it we are all annoyed do to covid. But cancelling everyone just because of sum lil shit. Everyone is taking everything so personal. Death threats to a 16 years old? Who tries to handle all that fame? Wow... society literally just developed back xd
