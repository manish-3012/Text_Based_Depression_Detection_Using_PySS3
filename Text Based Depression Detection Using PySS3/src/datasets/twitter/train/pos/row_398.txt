ALL MY PROCRASTINATOR FRIENDS ON HERE I know this has been posted long ago, but there is a website, https://www.corrupt-a-file.net/ which renders a word, power point, video or image file unreadable.

HAND IN A BROKEN FILE TO YOUR TEACHER TO EARN FREE EXTRA TIME.
I donâ€™t recommend using it on teachers who are good with technology though.

The teacher will likely say it didnâ€™t work a few days ago and ask you to hand it in again, and you can blame technology for failing.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk
