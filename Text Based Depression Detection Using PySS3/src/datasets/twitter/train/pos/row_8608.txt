I now hate my MAPEH Teacher. First Impressions are kind of important to me. For this school year, my mom made me change schools since I was in the same school for five years. Since I'm now in a public school, classes start on Oct. 5. My subject teachers started their meetings and everything was going well, until. It was my MAPEH Teacher's time to start a meeting. It was kinda sudden. The day before the meeting, he informed all of us about the meeting starts at 1 PM and everyone should get ready.

So the meeting starts. Like every teacher, they start their speech with a simple greeting.

"Hi, my name is [INSERT TEACHER'S NAME] and I will be your [INSERT SUBJECT] teacher. I hope you will be-" and other kinds of nonsense.

This guy. He tells us his name, he tells us everything we should know.

MAPEH means Music, Art, Physical Education, and Health.

When he comes to the discussion of PE, that's when everything went downhill. He then started to comment on everyone's physical health. How we exercise, our weight, our diet, our weight, basically he started shaming. 

I was very insecure about my weight and this guy. THIS GUY commented on my weight. I then turned off my camera and THIS GUY keeps commenting. He then turned to the Health section AND GUESS WHAT. HE USED ME AS AN EXAMPLE. At the end of the meeting, It was time to leave. Normally, I would say thank you and gold afternoon before leaving, but this was different. This guy was different from other teachers. I don't even care if this guy was conscious for my health, THIS FUCKER BASICALLY TAUNTED MY WEIGHT. And the most frustrating of all, before I left, he said, "Good talking to you" to me. I say, "You too, sir." AND THEN HE FUCKING SAID. "Do YoU wAnT a BuRgEr?" I LEFT AND I NEVER FELT SO ANGRY AT MY PHONE EVER. 

I never talked about this to my family or friends since I saw how busy they are during this pandemic. This happened three days ago and I'm still thinking about it as I lie down on my bed. It bugs me on how rude people would get.
