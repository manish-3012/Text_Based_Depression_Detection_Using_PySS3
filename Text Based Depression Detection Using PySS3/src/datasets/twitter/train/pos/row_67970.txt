playing games is my way to cope And keep me from feeling sad and stressed out

However my parents don't understand that and instead take my phone away only to worsen the situation and make me feel like shit even more lol


They always ask why I'm always on my phone.

Well that's bcs that's the only thing that's keeping me alive dude thats the only thing that's helping me.And everything is done online now,I need to have my phone to turn in my assignments.I have online school.

It's the pandemic,I cant rlly go out,they scold me when I play games on the PC or spend too much time on my phone.

What else can I even do.
