What kind of sick asshole needs to take over a kids roblox account? Someone made their way into my little sisters roblox account. Most likely by brute force and they acted very quickly changing all of the information so the hundreds of hours she put into the games she loved is gone. What kinda asshole needs to ruin a kids fun like that? 

I mean Iâ€™m in a cyber security class so I do know a decent amount about this kind of stuff but fuck. THIS IS WHY YOURE SUPPOSED TO MAKE STRONG PASSWORDS KIDS! 

My mom isnâ€™t giving up though. Considering how much money she put into this account so weâ€™re trying to do what we can. Sheâ€™s contacting customer support while Iâ€™m trying to clean up the computer so I guess wish us luck!
