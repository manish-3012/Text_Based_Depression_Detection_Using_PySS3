My grandma is pissing me off right now So we had an argument about me not using my face cleansers and stuff to clean up my face and she kept tell me â€œyou donâ€™t use it so whatâ€™s the point?â€

We just got back from my aunt house and I couldnâ€™t find my toiletries, and asked my grandma where they were and she said â€œwhatâ€™s the point you donâ€™t even use themâ€ and then started ignoring me, and when she did find them she threw them over the kitchen counter onto the floor at me. 

So when I was taking my luggage upstairs, she asked me to take the orange juice that my aunt got my into the fridge and Iâ€™m not justifying myself but I was pissed. I responded with â€œoh sorry I donâ€™t use orange juiceâ€ and then she just yelled at me that she was throwing it away. 

Idk if she did im in my room rn. Idk Iâ€™m really pissed right now
