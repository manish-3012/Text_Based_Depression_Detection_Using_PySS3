I hate how my parents never got me tested for adhd like less so for hyperactivity but I have most of the inattentiveness symptoms

like bruh every parents night was like

"your daughter seems to have struggle concentrating, makes careless mistakes and seems to struggle to pay attention/stick to tasks"

like they've said this every year for like 10 years and they were never like "hmm this actually might be a problem"

my mum legit used to be a social worker she should pick up on these things (although I've heard her be like "I think most of the time it's bad parenting and bad diet that leads to 'ADHD'")
