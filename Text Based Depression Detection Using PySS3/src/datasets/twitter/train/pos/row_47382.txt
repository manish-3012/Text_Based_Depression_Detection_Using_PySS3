Strangest couple hours So today at 4 Oâ€™clock I check my schedule for work (I work at McDonaldâ€™s) thinking that I had the day off. Well apparently I didnâ€™t and I had a shift at 4:30. So I rushed to get there asking a friend for a ride cause I didnâ€™t get my license. (Iâ€™m 16) After the relief of getting there knowing Iâ€™m not late I was informed that I DIDNâ€™T have a shift today. So after all that bullshit I ended up walking home which is like 6 miles. But to top things off, on my way home I ran into my ex-girlfriend which was extremely awkward considering I was wearing my full McDonaldâ€™s outfit. AND my shoes were not meant for walking across town so my feet hurt like a bitch. Other than that, I had a pretty good day.
