I think I have a crush but Iâ€™m not sure. Please help me So throughout my entire life Iâ€™ve never had a crush, not once. Until recently but Iâ€™m really not sure. We know each other quite well but not at a level where we hang out, but we talk to each other when weâ€™re around. I donâ€™t feel warm or have butterflies in my stomach but recently I have started to daydream about us. I like a lot of things about her like her music taste, humour and that type of thing. Like I said earlier, I love never had a crush before so Iâ€™m clueless on this type of thing.
