Words that mean cool Ay yo, I'm tryna make a list of words and phrases, slang or actual english, that mean or have meant in the past the same as "cool". I've got a pretty good list, but I'm open to suggestions, stuff you use daily, stuff you hear on tv - short and outlandish/obscure words are the best, but don't leave out anything that sounds too basic, cause I might have forgot it. 
Here's the list so far: 

100, Awesome, awesome sauce, amazing, banging, bee's knees, brilliant, bonny, boss, cat's pajamas, cool, cool for cats, copacetic, cool beans, coolio, classic, chill, cute, chido, dandy, dank, divine, dope, epic, empingao, extreme, fantastic, far out, fresh, fly, fye, GOAT, gnarly, glorious, grand, great, groovy, hunky dory, hip, lit, marvelous, major, monumental, magnificent, mint, money, neat, neato, nice, nifty, perro, pog, radical, righteous, rocking, revolutionary, sweet, swag, sick, spectacular, sensational, slick, slaptastic, swagtastic, splendid, stellar, swell, smacking, styling, terrific, tubular, tight, wild, wicked

Tl;dr: what slang do you use that means "cool"
