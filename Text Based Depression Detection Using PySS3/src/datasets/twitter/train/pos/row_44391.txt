Not interested in a relationship makes me a weird guy? Seriously I donâ€™t want to be in a relationship because I have some trust issues, insecurities. I know itâ€™s good to be in a relationship but Iâ€™m really not interested in any of those. People see me as a weird guy and yeah Iâ€™m from a strict family and been in a kind of relationship before but thatâ€™s not a relationship. 

Thank you
