Trying to get back 2 years worth of pictures and other files from a corrupted hard drive It's not fun...I'm such a fuckinh idiot for thinking that since the computer was fairly new that nothing bad would happen. I shouldve known better. Shouldve backed up the files. But I didnt, cause I'm stupid. And now idk if I'll ever see my stuff again
