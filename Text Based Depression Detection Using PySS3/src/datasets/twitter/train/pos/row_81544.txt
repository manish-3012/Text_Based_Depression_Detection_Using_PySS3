Is it illegal to sext at 15? I know that sending sexual videos and images is very illegal, but what about just normal sexual messages? Like if both people are consenting and they are both minors? 

I live in the US, I'm sure that plays a role in the legality of it. 

One time a guy tried to sext with me, it made me really uncomfortable, because I didn't agree with it. But it made me start wondering about it more. Maybe its something I would want to try sometime? But I don't want to if its illegal.

(PLEASE DO NOT MESSAGE ME, I'M NOT LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO SEXT WITH, I JUST WANT A TO KNOW IF ITS LEGAL OR NOT, THANK YOU)
