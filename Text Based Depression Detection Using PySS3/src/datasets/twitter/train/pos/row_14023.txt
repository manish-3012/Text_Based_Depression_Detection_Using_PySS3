Anyone feel old? Around this time of year I usually start looking for things I might want for Christmas to narrow down my list by December and I just realized that I literally have everything I could want this year.  Nothing newâ€™s come out that I like, things that did come out are just boring, and it just feels like overall I donâ€™t find interest in the things I used to want.  My mom literally bought me everything Iâ€™ve wanted and I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d feel a little empty thinking about how my interests have changed over the years.  First Christmas Iâ€™ll have where I donâ€™t really want anything.  Itâ€™s funny, when I was younger I used to think that Iâ€™d see so much more stuff Iâ€™d want, but now I just want to go back to the days when everything was interesting.

TL;DR: I feel old and I donâ€™t like it
