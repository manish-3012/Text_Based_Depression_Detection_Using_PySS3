Society has become soft This quarantine my interest in space exploration has been rekindled and I have begun reading autobiographies of the first astronauts particularly Neil Armstrong and Deke Slayton. These men grew up on farms. They liked to play outside. They had no internet or video games.

Has technology made us less adventurous and more risk averse?
