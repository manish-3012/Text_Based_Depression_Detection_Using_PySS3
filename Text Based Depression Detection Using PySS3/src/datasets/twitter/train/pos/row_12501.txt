Is it worth committing to a long distance relationship if you're not sure how it's going to turn out? I've been talking to someone now for the past month and a half in the talking talking kind of way. Problem: they dont live close (at the moment) and their parents wont let me see them in person when they are around. I really like them but we are so different that I'm not sure it will work out and it is a HUGE workout to do a relationship over long distance I've heard. They're getting to the point of wanting to call things official and I'm just not sure right now. What should I do?
