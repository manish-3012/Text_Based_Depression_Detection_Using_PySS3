I hate ads for kids so much Why do they have to make such punchable faces?

For context, an ad for Kinder Joy was on TV and the two kids eating it went like

#OMG KINDER JOYYYYâ„¢Â®Â©????? ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜®

Like ffs kid it's just a little bit of chocolate don't act like you have never seen it in your life goddamit
