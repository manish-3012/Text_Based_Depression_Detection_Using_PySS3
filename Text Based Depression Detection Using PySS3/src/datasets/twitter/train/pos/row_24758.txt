Helloo it's me again I was thinking, do you need a reminder again like yesterday? Well here is your reminder, because you are so forgetful. I love you. I love you so much that you are one of the reasons I am still alive. I respect you and if your parents do not accept you for any reason, I do accept you. And I just want you to know that you are an amazing person and you are perfect in every single way. You are much more important than you realise. So yeah that's it. I hope you have a good night, sweet dreams!
