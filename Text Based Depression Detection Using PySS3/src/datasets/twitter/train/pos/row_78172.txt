Gonna be 20 in an hour. I really really don't wanna go there. Plis. Teenage was the best. Period.
I can write a million reasons why, but you will realise it too

This sub is so awesome, never gonna leave here. I know I'll not suddenly transform into some super responsible disciplined "adult"
And also,
Am I not supposed to have mood swings anymore?
