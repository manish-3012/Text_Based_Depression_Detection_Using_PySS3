So basically I need some help So the thing is, 2 months ago I found my first and best friend. We are both straight guys but I feel him super close, like a brother. But I still canâ€™t shake some sexual thoughts about him. Idk if this is normal. I just really love him, I love everything about him. And I just want to look him straight into his eyes and say it but I donâ€™t have the balls. Can some of you rad lads give me some advise on how can I confess my feeling without scaring him off or making him feel weird.
