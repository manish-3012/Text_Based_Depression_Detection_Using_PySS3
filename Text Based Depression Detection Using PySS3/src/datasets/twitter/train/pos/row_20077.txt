Updated on my 18th birthday. Worst one ever! I had to go to the hospital emergency room and I was there till the next day at 3 am. My stomach and heart were hurting really bad, and it turns out the medicine I was taking I have an adverse reaction to it. I never ate anything that night. So not only am I tired, I'm in pain, basically starving, and exhausted from my blood being drawn. WORST BIRTHDAY EVER!!! My 18th birthday one that should be celebrated because I finally hit adulthood WAS SPENT IN THE HOSPITAL!!! IT FUCKING SUCKED!!!
