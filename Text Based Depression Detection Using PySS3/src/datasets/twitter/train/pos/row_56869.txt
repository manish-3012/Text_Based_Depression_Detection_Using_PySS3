My friend and I were muslim, and I told him I was thinking of getting out of Islam. Big mistake. I already made a post about me thinking about getting out of Islam. I haven't told anyone but my best friend who I have been friends with for 9 years for. I thought he would accept it but it turns out I was wrong big time. He started saying how I was gonna go to hell and how my parents would be so dissapointed. He even threatened to call my parents after I told him that I didn't want them to know. I blocked him so he got his brother to text came and tell me to unblock him. I did and he started going on about how I shouldn't have blocked him and how he was just trying to save me from hell. I would send a picture but I can't. I did send a picture on
