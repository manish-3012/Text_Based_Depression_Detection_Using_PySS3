help with school stuff i have to go back to school in a week, but im really stressing over it because i have a lot of assignments which ive not done and i keep telling myself ill do them but then i just end up procrastinating and falling even further behind. i constantly get distracted by things like youtube discord and reddit and i dont know how i will finish all my assignments in the next 7 days as i still have online school in that time and i have like 20 tasks to do. any advice on how to stop procrastinating and getting distracted by other things would be greatly appreciated.
