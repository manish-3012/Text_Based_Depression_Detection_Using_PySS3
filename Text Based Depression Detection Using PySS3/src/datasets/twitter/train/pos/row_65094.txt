First day of virtual Driverâ€™s Ed; what could possibly go wrong? Well, for starters, there could be a bad storm outside. And then the storm knocks out the power for half a second, bringing the Wi-Fi with it. Then when your dad finally gets the Wi-Fi back on, youâ€™ve been kicked out of the meeting. Oh, and the meeting has been locked so you canâ€™t get back in. Of course the teacher doesnâ€™t see your email because heâ€™s too busy teaching the class. And the two kids you emailed didnâ€™t see it, either. 

All of this happened to me yesterday. I have Driverâ€™s Ed today. Wish me luck!
