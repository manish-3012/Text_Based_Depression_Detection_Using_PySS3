Some of the people that use amino are disgusting Ok get ready for some long text. For those of you who don't know what amino is, its a social media app with a bunch of different groups you can join that fit your interests, kind of like reddit. The app itself isn't bad at all, its the majority of the people that use it. I'm not saying everyone on there is bad, just some of them. If you're familiar with the app, you would probably know that its ridded with fangirls kids that use gacha life. Most of them aren't actually bad, but some of them, are just sick and disgusting. I recieved some dms that i absolutely hated. I don't have them anymore as i have deleted them. 

Exhibit A: Someone invited me to a chat, and I thought this might be my first online friend on amino. At first the conversation seemed normal, they asked how i was doing and stuff like that. then they sent me r34 of my little pony, and said "this could be us" just think about that. someone put time and effort into drawing that.

Exhibit B: Another person invited me to a chat. I thought to myself, "please just be a normal person." Boy was I wrong. The first thing he says is "hey shawtyðŸ˜˜" You can already tell this is going downhill. I said to him, "what do you want" He said he wanted some coochie. told him it wasnt my problem that he was a virgin, and that im a guy. he obviously ignored that message and sent me a pic of him in a fursuit in a sexual position. i just blocked him and reported him

Listen, you can use amino if you want to, just be safe when you use it.
