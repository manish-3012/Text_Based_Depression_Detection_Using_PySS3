How do I voice in a group chat that I feel ignored sometimes? Iâ€™m in this group chat of people and we all play overwatch and Minecraft together. But sometimes when I ask if anyone wants to play competitive I feel as if Iâ€™m ignored. Sure Iâ€™m not all the time but they literally saw the message and sent memes not even acknowledging me as if I wasnâ€™t even there. I tried playing with other groups but I donâ€™t want to have to deal with the whining about heals. I know my teams good and all. But I think I might have disappointed them somehow. I mainly play mercy as a pocket and we lost and won almost evenly. Should I say something and risk getting kicked out by my friends or just keep my mouth shut and just wait for another chance.
