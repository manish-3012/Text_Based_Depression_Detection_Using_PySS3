Ninjago rewatch:Part 1 Starting today I will be rewatching all of Lego Ninjago on Netflix. I only remember up to big the robot reveal (maybe i watched further idk) and I want to see if it still holds up. Anyone willing to join me can. I'll try to post updates when I progress far enough (probably after every season).

Edit: I definitely watched passed the robot reveal, I think it was till around season 3 or 4.
