how did yâ€™all get your parents to knock before entering your room iâ€™ve been telling my mom for YEARS to knock on my door before she enters my room and have had my dad tell her many times too and she just always... forgets? i could remind her daily but she just always walks in or itâ€™s one knock while opening the door and sheâ€™s basically already in my room.

iâ€™m an only child so i have no siblings to discuss it with... so iâ€™m turning to this sub. 

iâ€™ve looked for locks on the internet, but they donâ€™t allow me to put one on the door.. and iâ€™m just really fed up at this point. i just want my mother to knock/scream/whatever else is a sign of her entering my room lol.

is there some deep discussion about knocking yâ€™all have had with your parents to get them to knock or is my situation a special case... ik thereâ€™s worse things in the world rn than this but still :â€™)
