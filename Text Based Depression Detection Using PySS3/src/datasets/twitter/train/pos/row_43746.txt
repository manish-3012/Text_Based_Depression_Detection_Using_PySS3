Guys holy shit I got a new PB on Bathroom shower% Iâ€™ve been stagnating for somewhere close to a week now only making few second time saves by using things like the quick wash strat, but today I managed to get a 5:06. My old pb was a 6:10. I saved over a minute! I think it was because of a really good hair split and decent splits the rest of the way through.  Iâ€™m thinking of grinding out runs for a sub 5 min, but I canâ€™t think of any new strays to implement. Any ideas?
