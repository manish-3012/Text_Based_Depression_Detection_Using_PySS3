I might finally be able to get a girl but my mind wont let me have her So i have had a thing happening to me this night.

So i post on tiktok for almost a year now, i just do random stuff on there what comes to my mind and i have around 25 tiktoks published. There were some regulars liking my vids and among them there was this girl. I was looking at her profile for i dont know how long and just like that she added me on snap.

We texted for hours smiling at each other having fun, talking deeply and full of feelings. We both fell for each other and im sure of it.. For myself at least. It's suspicious to me that she knew some things about me that only close friends know, its possible she figured out but then again. Also shes perfect for me and really adorably beautiful, but i dont trust it there has to be a hidden reason she wont tell me, making me push her away from me and i dont want that. I really want her but at the same time i dont know what shes after. Any advice?
