I crashed my car. (TL;DR is at bottom)
I drive a somewhat modified 350z and a few days ago I crashed it. I was driving around my street for fun with my friends and we were pulling off some drifts and stuff. I took a hard 90 degree turn and floored it to get some slides. I ended up losing control of my wheel and I tried my best trying to grab it back but it was too late. I took my foot off my pedal and tried too brake. At this point I already scraped my rear end trying to get back into control. I crashed my front bumper onto the curb and end up ripping off my bumper and crushing my intercooler. My car stalled and I was slightly dazed from the jerk of the hit. I regret not replacing my steering wheel to a grippier one. My 350z is fine but I will have to get a new front and rear bumper with a bew intercooler.

TL;DR I crashed my 350z, got dazed and had to replace some parts.
