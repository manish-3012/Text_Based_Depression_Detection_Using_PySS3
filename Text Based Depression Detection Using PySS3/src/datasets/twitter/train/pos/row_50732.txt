I h@te everyone and everything Life just keeps throwing obstacles at me and I get less and less motivated to overcome them every day. It just doesnt seem to get better like I told myself it would four years ago when this shit started. I can't go on like this forever. I still have ATLEAST five years of this hell of a school in front of me and then I'll have to work in a field I dont like for SIXTY FUCKING YEARS.

I can't fucking take it anymore
