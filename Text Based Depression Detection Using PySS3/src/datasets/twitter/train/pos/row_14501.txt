Sighting Of A Phoenix? Today I was sitting bat and just thinking about life, when I remembered about seeing a real phoenix in the sky. It was about 1 year ago, and me and my cousin were hanging out. We happen to both be looking at the sky, when we saw a bright orange bird fly over us and  disappear. Now your probably saying "Oh it was probably a hawk." While I do get hawks in my area it was nothing like it. 

When it disappeared, it did it in a sort of fashionable way. it just ignites, like if you would with paper it, but it did it really quick. It was a bright sunny day and we didn't get a picture sadly, but I swear to this day we saw a real phoenix.
