Is there a Hiking boots trend going on or is this an anomaly? I am sitting in a restaurant near a high school, so far, 6 of the last handful of students coming through were wearing hiking boots. (The first one caught my eye, then I picked up the others) is this a trend for kids now? 

Hell, I still own my Doc Martens from back then, but they had their moment.
