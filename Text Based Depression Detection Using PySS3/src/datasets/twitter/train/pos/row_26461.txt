I told my crush I liked but that I just wanted to stay as friends I still like her, but every time I like a girl everything goes to hell and I donâ€™t want that to happen again because she likes that same things as me and is a great friend. So yeah, I just friendzoned myself so we could still be friends, idk what to do. Iâ€™m just gonna give up on getting a girlfriend at all. I also need to sleep. Thanks to the two people who see this.
