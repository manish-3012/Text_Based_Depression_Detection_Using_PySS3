I'm just going to vent, nothing really interesting Today I had an exam (+5 stress) which actually went quite smoothly, but I'm not really confident about the mark, I feel like I'm going to get a 90% not a 100% (+10 stress)

[current stress level: 15/100]

After that, I cycled with my school (I don't have online classes) for 3 hours. I'm in terrible condition, and I didn't rest at all because by the time I arrived when the rest of the group was taking a rest, they had already started to  move (+50 stress)

[current stress level: 55/100]

A friend of mine fell and ended up with considerable bruises, she was bleeding everywhere (not a lot, but in various places), her bike broke, and the teacher carried it the rest of the day. When we arrived to the building, I had to take her bike, her backpack (with both our backpacks combined, it was like 7kg). I was abnormally tired, thirsty and hungry by then (+44 stress)

[current stress level: 99/100]

When I finally got home, I had to take the bike up the elevator, but I managed somehow. Anyways, I opened the door, I let go of the bike, desperate for food and water, and my sister starts screaming at me calling me an idiot (+20 stress). 

[current stress level: 119/100]

I started crying, I told her it was an accident while I went to the kitchen and drank water. Then, my mom came and yelled at me for crying, saying I was too loud and that I should shut up already because my dad was in an online reunion. (+20 stress). I let myself just fall on the floor (mostly because my legs gave in) and cried silently. My dog came to comfort me (-50 stress).

[current stress level: 89/100]

My dad came in to my room and asked if I was ok, and he also told me not to worry about my mom, because she often overreacts, given the fact that he didn't even hear me cry, she just heard my mom and my sister yelling at me. (-89 stress)

Anyways, that's just how I see it, but from an external point of view, I'd probably sound like this:

Oh DeAr LoOoOrD I'm SuCh A VicTiM aNd A DrAmA qUeEn ExErCIsInG lIkE evErYoNe eLsE SuRe iS HaAaAaAaAARd!

(I kinda hurt my self esteem right there, but let's face the facts)


I haven't eaten yet, kinda lost appetite, I'm too tired to eat
