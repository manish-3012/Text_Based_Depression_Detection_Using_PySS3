How can I fix this awkwardness between me and my potential girlfriend? I met this girl online. We call each other cute and all that jazz. She goes on about how my eyes are the most beautiful she has ever seen. But when we meet in real life, it gets super awkward. Mind you during the meetings we've had 2 other people along us, but me and the girl have had our alone moments too. 

All we do is talk, and it's difficult to do that at times as well. We have barely even broken the touch barrier. She stays close to me (Walking and sitting beside me), but never makes any moves. And neither do I. I'm afraid she will be scared or something. Is she waiting for me to make a move? She did warn me that she is shy though. Most I've done is some teasing and a little friendly touching, but that's it.

Today, me and the girl we're going home on a train, with me sitting beside her. Just the 2 of us, in the evening, with snowing outside. A perfect chance, I thought. But no. She just was on her phone, and we didn't say a word during the trip. I don't know if I was supposed to do something there. Or was she interested in me at all. but then I remember the talk we had online. 

With this pace, we will never become anything. Even in the most serene, romantic situations, she doesn't do anything. So I guess I should be the one who does, but how do I do that?
