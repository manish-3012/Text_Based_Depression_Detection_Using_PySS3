I Just Hate Stereotypes Not just like the standard image of a french man but the fact that it's expected that women have higher standards than men. I thought that it was 2021 but it sucks that you are still expected to behave normally, and like when you don't people will say that it is weird or just straight up cringe that you are different. Just look at furries you know deep down that you find them either weird or just strange, you can be the sweetest person on earth and still deep down have that opinion. Now of course there is nothing wrong with furries and there is nothing wrong with overweight people either, but how many skinny people have felt just a little bit of disgust while looking at one. You just blindly assume that they are just messed up because they are heavier than you. And don't get me started on these people criticizing the LGBTQ. Or maybe you have never met a Trump supporter, because their are multiple good Trump supporters out there, but most of them just are behaving inappropriate so you just assume they are all bad
