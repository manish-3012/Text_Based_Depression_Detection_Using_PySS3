Just got word from my math teacher that I got a 0/50 in the test Because I turned the test in 10 minutes late this is the same teacher that told me DURING the test to take my time with it I donâ€™t know what to do I have an 83% in that class I donâ€™t want that grade to drop last year I got a c in the class and this year I wanted to better myself and because of this I will go back to the grade I had before all my effort was for nothing
