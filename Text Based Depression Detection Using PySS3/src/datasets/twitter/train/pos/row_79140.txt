How do I explain this... Well this is very hard to explain but imma just try to explain it as good as I can. I like one of my close friends. Iâ€™m a 16 year old male and sheâ€™s a 16 year old female. We have been hanging out a bit more than usual lately, and we mostly just goes for long walks in the park. I do have feelings for her, but not very strong yet (since I only figured out that I like more than as a friend recently) and she is literally the perfect girl for me. We have a lot in common and she really makes me act as the kind person I want to be. I want to tell her that I like her a bit and that I think that we would make an amazing couple, but I donâ€™t want it to blow out of proportion, since I donâ€™t have very strong feelings for her yet, and I definitely donâ€™t want to ruin the friendship or make it weird, because I still want her in my life. What should I do?
