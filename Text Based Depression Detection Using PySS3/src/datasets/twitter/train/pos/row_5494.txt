my abusive ex texted me again itâ€™s been about a week since we broke up and he made another account to message me since i blocked him on everything. the way we broke up was terrible. i told my friend to do it quickly for me so i wouldnâ€™t have to face him (it was long distance). i canâ€™t imagine what it was like for him but i know i canâ€™t go back to him or else the same things will happen again. i deleted his message as fast as i could but i still remember it fully.  

â€œyou didnâ€™t even give me a chance to say goodbye. that was very silly of you, you knowâ€

i donâ€™t want to go back but i think i have to say sorry to him but iâ€™m scared something will happen again and i canâ€™t take that. 

what do i do ?
