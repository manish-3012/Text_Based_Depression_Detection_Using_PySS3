A girl asked me out today Yes you read the title right and no Iâ€™m not karma whoring, a girl actually asked me out. 
I was playing football before school ended and she just came up to me and asked. 

Just saying this is my second day at this school, 
I am the new kid and so I have never been asked out before so I said yes. 
Iâ€™ve never dated someone before so please give me tips and help me. 
I also gave her my number.

Edit: apparently the school has a no dating rule but apparently as well they donâ€™t care to much?
