ya know what hurts a lot more than people realise playing an instrument

like I play double bass and I get blisters, callouses and shit from it

my arm get sore from bowing and my fingers get sore from holding down notes

and don't even get me started on my back cause you need to sit up straight to play

at this point I'm used to it
