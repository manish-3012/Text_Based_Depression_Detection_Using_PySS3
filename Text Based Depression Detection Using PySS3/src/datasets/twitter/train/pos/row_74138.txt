My repressed ex-religious ass got hugged by a stranger on a dare and I've never felt better than this before To set the stage I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness, in a cult that controls ones ability to make friends outside of the religion and sexually represses it's members (along with covering up child abuse and other terrible stuff). This has given me social anxiety and low self worth even after "waking up" from their ideology. So when this happened it really affected me.

I was coming down an escalator and a girl (slightly younger than me) scampered forward from her group of giggling friends and hugged me awkwardly as I walked off the bottom of the escalator, quickly then running back to her group.

I was really flattered that I was the guy they dared the girl to hug. I jumped to the conclusion that she had said she thought I was cute or something and the others had then pressured her into doing it (although that is definitely reading into it a bit too much). It's not that I was attracted to the girl (I barely had time to see her face and I think she was younger than me) it's just that I have been so completely starved of validation that that tiny bit made me feel more fucking confident than I have been in ages. 

Fellow teenagers. Compliment your friends. Especially guys. They are so often struggling with low self esteem and a bit of external support can do miracles (but don't hug people right now with COVID and all)

Question: do you guys think that girl probably liked me or do dares like this happen regardless of attraction
