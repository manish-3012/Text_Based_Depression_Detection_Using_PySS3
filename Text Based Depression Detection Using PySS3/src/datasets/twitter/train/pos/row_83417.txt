Some help to understand guys/girls 1.They are humans, treat them as such.
2. Everything is case by case, there is nothing that is consistent about people other than their inconsistency. 
3. Share an interest, if you don't have something that both you and the other person can discuss, there isn't a really high chance of having a relationship with that person
4. Being yourself isn't always the best thing, but there is a message in that changing yourself too much might scare off the person interested in you
5. If they reject you, just sucking up your pride and being good friends with them is the best course of action, if you liked somebody to the point of making it official but they said no, why not be friends with them anyway, they must be rather cool.(Its going to be awkward, ik that, but only for so long)

All of these are essentially broad and vague to serve a purpose, its meant for the greatest audience. This isn't a "Put-A-Token-For-Relationship-Machine", and even if you follow the spirit and the letter of every dating advice textbook,  you are guaranteed nothing. Even my advice isn't guaranteed a relationship, but can offer a guide. Last, but not least 

7. Be confident, even if you don't know whats going down. And even if you fail, pick yourself up. 

You are a great person, with potential in your heart and dedication in your hands. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
