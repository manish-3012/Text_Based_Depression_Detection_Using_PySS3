Need some help Hey Guys, I need some urgent advice.

Just some backstory my parents are Asian, so they are quite strict. Anyways, I got a new phone and signed a contract with my dad, saying that I could not download any form of social media. But I did. I downloaded Snapchat. So my mum found out and is telling me to tell my dad, but I'm scared to do so because he might break my phone, which is what happened when I tried downloading Snapchat on my old phone. What should I do?
