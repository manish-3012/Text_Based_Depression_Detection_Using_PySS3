Im so much happier Before around a month ago i was stuck in a cycle of sleeping and eating and playstation with nothing else but my mind telling me to end it. But them my bestfriend asked to meet, keep in mind Iâ€™ve liked her a while, she asked me to meet her and so i did, we were talking and suddenly she said â€œim gonna regret it if i dont do thisâ€ and kissed me. I loved it and since that day I havenâ€™t thought of killing myself, hurting myself or doing anything bad to myself. Moral of the story is: just go for it, you could save a persons life :)
