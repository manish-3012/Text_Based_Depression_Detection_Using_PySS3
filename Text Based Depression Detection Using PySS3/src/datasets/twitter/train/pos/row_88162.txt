God I did it again I tried to kill myself That makes the second time this year. I've been going through alot and having alot of suicidal thoughts. I got into a huge argument with my mom today. She hit me really hard on the chest and took away my phone. Apperently I don't "respect her" enough. She also told me that she will be stricter with me and force me to be a "normal person". Not who I want to be but to be a "real man". This is because I am trying to grow my hair out long and I wear all black basically every day.

With everything that I've been going through, this pushed me over the edge. So in the heat of the moment I ran to my room, grabbed a belt, tied it around my neck and tried to suffocate myself. I almost passed out but I didn't have the guts to go all the way, but the scary thing is that this time I got alot closer to actually killing myself than last time. If nobody was home I probably would've just straight up hung myself on the beam in the garage. 

Afterwards I broke down and just cried and cried. God I hate my life. Why couldn't I have just been born into a normal family with normal parents.

Idk what I'm going to do now.
