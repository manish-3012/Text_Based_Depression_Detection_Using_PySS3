what purpose do ants even serve they just get everywhere and steal your food, i can't even take a crap without them getting everywhere, what point do they serve other than annoying me off by getting in my bed so whenever i try to sleep i have to brush them off myself every five seconds, and i say again, what purpose do they have that can balance all the hell that i'm forced to go through every time i step into any room of my house?
