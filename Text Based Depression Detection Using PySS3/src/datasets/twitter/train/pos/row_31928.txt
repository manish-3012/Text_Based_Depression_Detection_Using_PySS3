Why are my friends like this? When we are playing video games, They always call everyone cheaters, for litterally no reason,  Just admit they you are worse than them at the game, that you made a mistake, It's Just a game. When they get headshotted, they call aimbot, When they get spotted, They call them wallhack, Every game. I just want to have fun, not listen to you accousing everyone.
