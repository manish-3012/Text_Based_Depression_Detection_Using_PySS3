Yo donâ€™t get into bed tonight Some crazy stuff happened to me. 


It makes you drowsy until your eyes canâ€™t stay open and then u regain conciseness from anywhere between 1-12 hours, without any memory of what happened. 


Iâ€™m currently on 43 hours guys but I think my bed is staring at me and secretly planning to kill me  ðŸ¤¨ 

Anyway whatâ€™s everyone doing for Halloween?
