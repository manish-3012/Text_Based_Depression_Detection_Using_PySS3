Highschool basketball is dumb It always seems like the kids that only shoot three pointers and make only 20% of them are played. Youâ€™ve got other kids who can shoot mid range, make layups, and if needed to, shoot threes, but apparently thatâ€™s not what the coaches want. They want kids who donâ€™t rebound, canâ€™t make their threes, rarely shoot mid range, and never make their layups. A few of them are good at taking the ball down the court, but does it really matter if you make bad passes every possession? 
Well we had a scrimmage the other day, and it was the actual skilled players, vs the kids who I just described. The actually skilled players won every single time.
