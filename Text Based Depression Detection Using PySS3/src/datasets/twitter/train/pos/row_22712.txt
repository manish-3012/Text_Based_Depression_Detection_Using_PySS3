Honestly Iâ€™m so sad right now so I made a song (remix) Verse:
Oh, I can see a house of red and white and brown,
some lights and a door, a lawn, a garden too
I see some run-down furniture that light the room 
Some hearts of ice, some weeds and rust of iron

Chorus:
Is this good-bye now, my Family
Farewell Family, adieu!
Must I leave you now, my Family
Will this be my last good-bye to you?

Verse:
Must I say good-bye to mum and Mary and Louise too
To Sophie and the cousins and to all the friends I knew
It was a family fight  and I'm too big to Patronise and scold
You slammed the door and left me here standing in the cold

Chorus:
Is this good-bye now, my Family 
Farewell Family, adieu!
Must I leave you now, my Family
Will this be my last good-bye to you?

Verse:
I've got my red flame ambition, my Mind of Mystery,
I've got my own young life that guide me
The love I cherished just isn't the one that I'm used to
You'll find the old one hiding there behind your broken bottle


Chorus:
Is this good-bye now, my Family
Farewell Family, adieu!
Must I leave you now, my Family
Will this be my last good-bye to you?
Will this be my last good-bye to you?


(Original Song: John Edmond-Farewell Britannia)
