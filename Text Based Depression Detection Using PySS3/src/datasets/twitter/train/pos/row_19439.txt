Movie Idea, hear me out! There's a cosmic shift that changes all animals in the island of Manhattan into humans. Pigeons, dogs, cats, rats, everyone's a human. And then the rats fight against the oppression and some showdown I haven't quite thought about. And the best part is, a labrador human played by Jim Carrey.

Might be a cheesy movie, but atleast it'll be wholesome.
