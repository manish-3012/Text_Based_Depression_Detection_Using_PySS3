Stop being like â€œif youâ€™re here from tik tok fuck youâ€ Imagine sharing song that you like on a platform with millions upon millions users making it more likely itâ€™ll gain recognition and more people will become fans of it. Imagine. Imagine that. 

Like seriously donâ€™t be such a dick if someone discovers a song in such a way that you donâ€™t agree with. Just be happy that they liked the song enough to go and check it out. God
