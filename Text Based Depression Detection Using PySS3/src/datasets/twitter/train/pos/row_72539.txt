Ever wait all day for dinner and then itâ€™s just some shitty salad. Doesnâ€™t eat much of anything all day because your family only eats in meal a day so you wait all day for dinner just for you dad to hit you with a â€œI want something light for dinner. So saladsâ€ and because you donâ€™t like confrontation you just say â€œyeah thatâ€™s fineâ€ and you eat a bunch of salad but it didnâ€™t fill you up and still leave your soul empty because it was a shit salad that was just lettuce, a few veggies and ranch. So now you just want to sit in your room and cry for a little bit. I hope you guys have a good dinner.
