New Generation So I've been thinking alot about this and I thought it would be rly cool to share it. I get the feeling that this generation of teenagers like 2002-2008 has marked the beginning of something great. I remember my dad once told me when he was young he played lots and lots of football (soccer for the Americans here) and that they gathered groups of other dudes to play in fields and I thought to myself hey that's cool. But then he told me that he was about my age when they did that. I'm 17 and I thought to myself and said "What do we do that's similar to older generations" and I realized gaming had evolved so much that it can literally replace that kind of fun. Well, not as healthy but you get what I mean. Kids and teenagers gather and play for hours and hours just like the old times but it's different now and it's cool and I fucking love it because it's gonna evolve even more in the future. The only sad thing about it is that sports are gonna start falling in the future but rly far future.
