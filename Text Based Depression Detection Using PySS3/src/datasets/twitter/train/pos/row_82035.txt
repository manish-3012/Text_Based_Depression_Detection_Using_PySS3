Don't you ever have that moment of "what if this isn't real?" Not like an existential crisis or anything, I'm not breaking down over mortality or anything.

But just like, I have moments where "what if this is a simulation?"

"What if I'm watching Joseph's (me) life through VR recreation?"

"What if when I fell down the stairs that one time when I was like 5 and I could've broke my neck, I actually did break my neck, and this is just a coma or my brain dying on the staircase."

Alright, now back to pretending to do school work.
