Embarrassing story So Im in band class and the teacher calls on this girl about not having a Reed, and she says that her parents need to get her one. And I say something like  "oo she has parents, lucky". Now I live with my grandparents and most people knew that at the time. And she looks at me and goes "I'm adopted". And I didn't know that. And To this day I still cringe at that at 3 am when I'm trying to sleep.
