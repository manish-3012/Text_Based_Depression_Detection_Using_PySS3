A girl hugged me yesterday So i (m16)was with some friends at a campside (tbh i just met them yesterday but they are my best friend's friends and they were cool) we were just chilling and there was this girl(15) (little drunk) she was leaning on me and everything. This is not the interesting part bc i know they do things like that and thought nothing of it. Then some other girls(f16) come along with a dog(i believe my best friend's classmates). an hour passes we realise we had to go bc corona restrictions. We get back to the city everybody was saying bye. As i dont really know everybody( and i am shy af) i just said a loud hi. And the the random girl with the dog just comes up to me reaches her arms and i was like wtf man what do i do what do i do. And yeah i hugged a girl. It was awkward as hell but it is what it is. If it wouldt be the restrictions i would have walked her home too. Should i get the girls contacts or something? Or just say to my bestfriend to invite her down more often
