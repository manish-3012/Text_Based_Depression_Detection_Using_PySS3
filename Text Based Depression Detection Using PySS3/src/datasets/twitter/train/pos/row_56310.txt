That's nothing, man... So, Lucas asked if he must go bald and showed an earlier picture of him going bald and I want to say: "That's nothing, man! My uncle is much balder than you are!" And if he responds with: "That's not possible" I will say: "My uncle is bald too and you can see his skull! You can see his skull, Lucas!" Because I always need to surpass people. 


So, if Lucas gets bitten by two mosquitoes I'm going to say: "That's nothing, man! I was bitten by a lion yesterday...There was a lion in my bedroom, Lucas!"
