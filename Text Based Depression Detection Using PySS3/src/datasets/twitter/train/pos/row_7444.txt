Is there a way to stop seeing certain flares? Like, don't get me wrong, I do feel sympathy for people in bad situations but... And please don't call me a monster for this, but I just don't feel comfortable seeing "funny shit post" "cool art someone drew" "my dad died and I wanna kill myself" "funny meme" like... One of these things is not like the other and I'd prefer to stop seeing serious posts, is there a toggle I do or something? A certain search query? I feel guilty saying this but like, I just think it's better for my mental health to not see suicide stuff every 60 seconds, you feel?
