Men's shorts that go more than an inch or two above the knee look extremely awkward. TL;DR I don't even like shorts that go too much above the knee on women, much less so on men.

Super long baggy cargo or basketball shorts or whatever that go all the way to mid-calf are a bit much, I'll admit...but we do not need to swing so far into the opposite direction either.

To me, shorts should fall around the knee. An inch or two below or above is fine, but too far into either direction is bad.

However...people in my area, and /r/malefashionadvice seem to have developed some sort of thigh fetish to compensate for previously too long shorts. Now it's all "that sweet, sweet man thigh", "nothing wrong with showing a bit more leg", and "sky's out, thighs out."

Here's a [picture](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BC223_SHORTS_GR_20140509165121.jpg) of this sort of trend...the 11 inch actually looks fine, but all the other ones are a no-go in my opinion. Even if the 8 3/4 doesn't look **too** short when standing, imagine him sitting, raising his knee, or doing leg raise exercises...suddenly not so appropriate, huh? Now the 7 and 5 inch...don't even wanna think about it.

Another thing...underwear. I asked my friends who wear this style how the hell their boxers don't show, and they said they just went commando...when your shorts are so short you can't wear boxers with them...big yikes.

And last thing...how are they even comfortable? I personally hate feeling the skin on the back of my knee, or my bare lower thigh on public seats. Especially having to wipe down after sitting.

I don't even like the style on women, I like it even less on men.
