Can anyone relate this this? Im an introvert and very awkward and shy. And even people that i've known for years, im still really awkward around them and dont talk much. For example, a friend i've had since i was very young (im 15 yo now), it used to be my best friend and we used to hang out pretty much everyday. 
   But once we were around 13, we slowly stopped hanging out, and he found new friends. He is still in my class, but i literally haven't talked to him since  we stopped hanging out, its like were strangers. And i have a very hard time making new friends, even though my classmates are nice people, for some reason, i still am not comfortable talking to them.
