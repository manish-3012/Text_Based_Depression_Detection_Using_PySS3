My sister got into my phone and is noq threathening to send the messages that I sent to my gf Hi. 
This year i got my first gf and it is blissful . 
But today my fucking sister got into my phone and then sent me a love me I sent to my gf and then deleted it . 
Also , she sent my mom a "hello mom" and started laughing . 
For real  , idk how she knows my password and she was suspecting me for quite a while . My parents dont know of my gf and her parents dont know of me either. 
Guys what should I do ? 
I changed my password , checked everywhere but think she deleted any trace . It may be a coincidence but i dont think so . 
I already know her phone pass rn and she doesnt know that I know it . 
I wanna wait tonight some time and take the phone and delete any trace . And yeah I know its not ok but she did the same
