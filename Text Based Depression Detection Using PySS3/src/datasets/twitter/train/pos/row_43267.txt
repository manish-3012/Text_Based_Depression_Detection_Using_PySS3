I was put in a youtube video without my consent, how would I get it removed? The video was an omegle video, my face is visible and you can also hear my voice. I was not in public, I was in my room. I know laws and policies about these things can be complicated. I already asked the uploader and they told me they would not delete it. The uploader told me reporting the video would not do anything because being on omegle is legally being in public, I'm not sure if this is true. Also I'm under 18, would that help me get the video removed? I read youtube's privacy tos but I'm still really confused. Can someone here explain what I need to do to get the video taken down?

Edit: Using the massachusetts wiretapping law to get it removed
