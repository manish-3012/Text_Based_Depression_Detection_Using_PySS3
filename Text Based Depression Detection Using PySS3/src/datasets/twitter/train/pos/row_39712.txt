The most stupid activity teachers do Do a calendar with timetables, bruh they are useless , timetables are stupid , instead of asking â€œ wash your teeth 7,5, shower 7,10 eat 7,20 , itâ€™s way more convenient doing to do list , so you can say between 7,5 and 7,20 you have to wash your teeth shower and eat , because maybe some day you want to take long shower so that day youâ€™ll take less to eat , or maybe one day you donâ€™t want to shower in the morning because is fucking cold , or things like â€œ I want a defined timetable donâ€™t spend an extra second in that â€œ just study in the time you mark , like if I say I want to draw he asks me to do in what time of the day I want to draw like bruh maybe I one day I get an idea at the morning or maybe at night 


Conclusion: fuck timetables , to do lists are better
