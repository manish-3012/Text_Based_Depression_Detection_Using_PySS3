I hate my civics teacher! I am still in her class but screw her. For one, she purposefully tries to humiliate kids! She'll call your mom without turning off her mic and she has! Second she has this participation thing. Children should not be marked higher for more participation, that would give extroverted kids an advantage. Some kids are more nervous than others! It can be really hard for some kids to speak up in class! Third, She has to leave her biased opinion on everything. Like we don't care about what you think of this! Just teach! Forth the terrible way she has tests. She will tell you once a few days in advance with no reminder, how do you expect us to remember? And even if we did, we have no study guide, and a few very long articles that go over things with only a few from each of these on the tests. I know teachers can suck, But she just gets on my nerves.
