Adults Are Bad at Kids (Context: I'm American, in my mid-30s, and have worked with kids for \~15 years.)

I'm willing to bet that the majority of adults in your life (most through no choice of your own) interact with you in harmful ways without realizing it. Too often, the adult--teen relationship too closely resembles the jail guard--prisoner relationship. I have no idea why adults are consistently surprised that these people, still relatively fresh to the world, have the audacity to... make mistakes? Like, of course that happens, that's central to learning! Mistakes should be expected, even welcomed as learning opportunities (and not in that bullshit punishment-masking use of that phrase).

And when mistakes do happen, the interaction too often becomes punitive rather than instructional. I have no idea how you are supposed to learn and grow as human people under those constraints, and I wish that I could do something about it. You're all great and I hope you have a fantastic day!
