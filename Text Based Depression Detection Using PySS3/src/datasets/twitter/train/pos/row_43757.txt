Sharing my thoughts on life and shit People that are close to me, family, are getting upset, sad because of me. They try to connect with me every day to recreate the bond we had when I was just a kid. I dismiss them and get annoyed and angry at them. I donâ€™t want to hurt them, so of course i feel even worse after I â€œrejectâ€ them.
   They get upset and sad because of me, I mean a lot to them and they feel like they disappoint me.
I am the one who disappoints them, because i disappoint myself.
Look at me, I donâ€™t even have friends... just dreams.
Dreams.
   I want to be a creator. I want to make something that would impress the viewer. I want to be a photographer. I want to be a cinematographer. I want to be a musician. I want to be a writer. I donâ€™t want to be a wanna-be.
   I think Iâ€™m chasing money and fame. We could go back to the old times. Money &amp; fame. None of it. I suck at everything. I want the money and fame, ... so I can take away the problems of my family. 
   Would I choose family or friends. I want to be famous like them... â€œMy friendsâ€. Post Malone, Lil Peep, Milkavelli. I could go on, but itâ€™s unnecessary. I want to be like them. Their parents are proud and they can feel good about themselves. They are unreal. They are not real friends.
