Is it just me or are graduation parties and the graduation ceremony really overrated and unnecessary I'm not just saying that because I'm gonna be a kid that has fails school or anything, but I genuinely hate graduation parties and ceremonies. I hate being dragged to go to them for family or for someone my mom knows, and I'm gonna hate being dragged into my own ceremony. No matter what my mom tries to do, I am not having a party. if she sets up one I am not going to it. 

what are your views on it? I wish I could make a poll, but yknow, dumb subreddit rules *cough* mods pls enable *cough*
