Enough Christmas this year As I walked to school I saw that our neighbor had put up Christmas lights (thankfully only them out of the whole village. And when I got to school a girl was playing All I Want For Christmas. In Norway it's not as bad with us in the malls. It's the first time I've heard it this year, and I didn't remember it being so annoying.
