How do I get rid of the fear of people hating me?? So, I just got into high school and I was apart of a toxic friend group so during the summer I gathered the strength to stop putting up with their bullshit. 

And so when I went into high school I decided to join the fall play. I met a lot of people there and so I guess you can say Iâ€™m part of their friend group. We call a lot and talk during school, but I seriously canâ€™t shake the feeling of awkwardness. Something inside of me thinks that if I say just one thing wrong there all gonna hate me

Thereâ€™s been things Iâ€™ve been invited to, but Iâ€™ve declined or missed out on the opportunity of because I canâ€™t shake that dumbass feeling.

For a couple of examples, I was invited to their Halloween party but I declined because I was too scared of messing up something if I went. And today, I saw one of them texted me on Snapchat and I ignored it, and it turned out to be an invitation to go sledding with them, which I missed out on by waiting.

I love them all, Iâ€™ve talked to them and called with all of them. Itâ€™s just I feel like especially if we meet up in real life outside of school, everybody is gonna hate me.

I really donâ€™t wanna feel this way, and I really just need some advice
