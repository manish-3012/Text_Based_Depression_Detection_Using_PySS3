Here is my pain Well to the ten people who read this thank you. I just recently started dating someone and is was my first time dating a boy since becoming bi. Anyway heâ€™s going through a big move and moving to Missouri and heâ€™s been really stressed out and asked if could just stay friends for now witch I agreed to because I love him. However itâ€™s really hard because Iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll just move on and leave me alone.
