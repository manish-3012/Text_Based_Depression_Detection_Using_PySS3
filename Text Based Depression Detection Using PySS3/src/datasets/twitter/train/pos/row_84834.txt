Design and tech major work Hi all, as Iâ€™m transitioning into my final year of high school I will be undertaking a major project for design and tech. For this task we must identify a genuine need to design and manufacture a product that can solve the identified problem. Iâ€™m having some trouble coming up with ideas that I could base my project on, if any of you have anything at all that could be of use to me that would be incredibly helpful. It is my understanding that sustainable solutions receive higher marks. Some past projects include a solar powered electronic charity clothes bin, an adjustable farm supplyâ€™s container that fits into the back of a Ute, mycelium pot plants and so on.

Thanks so much for your time, Oscar
