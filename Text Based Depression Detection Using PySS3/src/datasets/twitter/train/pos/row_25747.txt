I feel so bad for her... Hi again reddit. I just need to share this with someone. Here goes.

For the past 4ish months, me and some friends had been doing zoom calls very often. Like, every few nights or so. The reason we started doing this was because we couldnâ€™t see each other in person due to quarantine. 

In early September, I got a girlfriend. She was one of the people I would zoom with often. 

For the past 2-3 weeks, I havenâ€™t been doing any zoom calls. School started again today, and I didnâ€™t go either. At the time, I didnâ€™t think much of it. No big deal, right?

My girlfriend messaged me tonight asking why I wasnâ€™t at school. She told me she is worried about me and I didnâ€™t quite know why. I kept telling her Iâ€™m fine, and then she seemed to get really angry. 

She then said that she has a friend who self-harmed during quarantine and was worried I was going to kill myself or something. 

I told her I would go to school tomorrow. 

I feel really bad for making her worry so much and being so ignorant about it. 

&gt;! I just needed to tell someone about this. I wonâ€™t be reading comments tonight because itâ€™s late and Iâ€™m going to bed. I will reply to comments in the morning. !&lt;
