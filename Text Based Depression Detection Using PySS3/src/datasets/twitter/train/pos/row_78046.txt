I did a big cringe I just remembered this girl. We both really loved apex legends and we used to talk about which characters we "shipped" we each other. Well turns out she shipped wattson and octane, who just so happened to be our mains at the time. Me seeing an opportunity said that i shipped them as well and that it was "such a cool coincidence". Anyway so weve been playing together for months by now and I distinctively remember asking her "would u be the wattson to my octane? And I also remember getting a one word cold "no" followed by a day or two of 0 replies, but it's been a while since and we actually sit next to each other in chemistry and physics :) but I kinda recognise that it's not gonna happen and i value her friendship. 

Anyways yeah that's my most recent big cringe involving a girl
