Don't you just love laptops? Especially when In the morning, it works so well, the internet is just fine, and seems like nothing could go wrong..

But the your computer just decides to fucking commit suicide and can't even get into a meeting for one minute before having a complete mental breakdown, kicking you off, and you have to find whatever device that is still functional, just so you have just to be present in the last half of a class meeting and missing half of the topic points made and being completely clueless as to what tf they are talking about?
