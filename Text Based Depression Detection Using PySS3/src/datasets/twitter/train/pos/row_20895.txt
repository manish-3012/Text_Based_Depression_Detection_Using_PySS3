Not a meme but... My god i havent felt happy in so long and i just dont know what to do. Like every thing that could have possibly gone well happened. I finally told someone i used to have a crush on them without them hating me, im allowed to drive for once in my life, i have genuinely good friends for the first time in my life. Like, my god how am i allowed to feel this good. Just wanted to share the good vibes here. Hope everyone has a great week!
