I am so relieved I was so scared about my report card coming in today because obviously my parents would see and I was afraid I got an F on one of my classes, but apparently my entire 1st semester grade was a C for that class and I know it's not really good but I'm actually relieved I didn't fail that class. (it was Art btw, online art class sucks)

YAY my parents aren't as pissed as last quarter!
