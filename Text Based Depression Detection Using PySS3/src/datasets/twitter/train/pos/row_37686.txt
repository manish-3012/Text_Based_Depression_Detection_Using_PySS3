I think I'm going insane because of music Music makes me go through every day, it is almost 24/7 for me, almost any genre, almost any artist. But our power went out and is going to be out for a while, so my radio wasn't playing music at all last night, I respect others, so I listen through one earbud rather than blasting it through speakers or my phone, but I haven't had my ear buds with me today and its making me go crazy. I'm shaking more than usual, my twitches are going crazy, and the ringing in my ears is driving me crazy! I need music now, but I don't have any way to listen!
