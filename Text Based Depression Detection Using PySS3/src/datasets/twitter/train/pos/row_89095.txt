Might have a chance with a girl(?) Idk, i knew her from middle school, got back in touch with her a few days ago and we've been talking everyday since. She uses the emojis "ðŸ¥ºâ˜ºðŸ¥°" a lot, she sometimes uses "â¤" and she sometimes calls me "hun" or "bby." Is just weird because she never seemed to have a crush on me, and the few times we texted she didnt refer to me as bby. Idk...
