Please, help me keep my PE Teacher! Ms. Richards (my teacher) is being forced to move schools after 26 years of teaching PE at Troy High School. She has tried everything she can, but the horrible contract she signed allows the district to do this. She's the most kind, understanding and accepting person that I've ever met. Every single person in our class is upset about this, and so we started a petition to keep her there. It says we need 200 to sign, but in order to bring it to the office, we need 650 signatures. So please, sign the petition! The entire school wants her to stay, but unless this petition gets enough signs, she has to go to our rival school.
