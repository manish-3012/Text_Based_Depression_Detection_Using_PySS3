Can you all help me find this kid's show I vaguely remember? I constantly think back to this 2d animated kid's show I used to watch as a kid but I have no idea what it's actually called. It was sort of like a comfort show for me and I really wanna go back and watch it again.

I bet at least of you watched it so please let me know if anything fits this description.

Here's what I know/remember:
- it's a kid's animated show

- I'm almost certain that it's a Japanese anime but for kids, (like Doraemon)

- looked very adorable, pretty sure it's about a family (I think they live in an apartment??)

- there's a scene of the main character shopping/in a grocery store (with their mum??) that I keep thinking back to

- existed over 8 years ago

I know it's not much detail but it's been bothering me so much to the point where I can't think about anything else. Sound familiar?
