My new favorite song [Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, I get paper (What?)
Everywhere I go, I get paper (What? Slatt, slatt)
I'm a rockstar, I could've joined Slayer (Rockstar, rockstar, rockstar)
Got the drum in the car, that bitch a slayer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get put in a box for fuckin' with a player (What? Yeah, yeah)
AR in the box and it came with a laser (What? Yeah)
I go cook a opp, yeah, just like I cater, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I fuck on my thot, yeah, we met in Decatur (Yeah)
I go ball on that bitch, yeah, just like a Blazer (What? Yeah)
Can't start with the bitch, I link another one later (What?)

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta get it together (You dig?)
I'm livin' my life like a rebel (What?)
They tried to lock me in a kennel (What?)
I beat the case, it was simple (What?)
Fresh out of court, yeah (Yeah)
Jump in the Porsche, yeah (What?)
Slide through the hood, yeah (What?)
Everything good, yeah (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Whole lotta mob shit (What?)
Whole lotta mob (What?), whole lotta mob shit (What? What? Yeah)
Whole lotta mob shit (What?)
Whole lotta mob (What?), whole lotta mob shit (What? Yeah)
Whole lotta mob shit (What? What?)
Whole lotta mob (What?), whole lotta mob shit (What? Yeah)
Whole lotta mob shit (What? What?)
Whole lotta mob (What?), whole lotta mob shit (What? Yeah)
What? What?
Whole lotta mob shit
What? Let's go, let's go
Whole lotta mob shit
What? Let's go, let's go
Whole lotta mob shit
Whole lotta mob shit
Whole lotta mob (What?), whole lotta mob shit (What? What?)
