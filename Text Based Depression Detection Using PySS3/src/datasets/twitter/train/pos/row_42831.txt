So I, an unpopular maybe a nerd (you prob get the idea) dude has been sitting at lunch with the preppy cool kids for a few days. So basically idk what people think I am, like a nerf maybe, I have no idea. That's how little I've talked to people to get an idea. My class has lunch outside unlike every other class in the school just because my class is at the very end of a hallway with a door outside and my teacher thought it'd be nice. Anyway I used to sit by myself and not talk to anyone, partially because I chose to and partially because no one invited me, but recently I started sitting with the "cool kids" I guess you could say. Just started talking to them about classwork and then the day after I just sat there and a circle formed, me being part of it. It's nice. Before this year and even sitting with them, I thought they were kind of superficial and stuff, you get the idea, classic preppy girls/boys, but now I'm fascinated by them. The sheer truth exerted in their conversation is like nothing I've ever seen before. But they all have social media and I don't and they know basically everybody and I only know people in the grade (and only by name mostly). Anyway it was all going good and I would sometimes contribute to the conversation but mostly just listen, until this one annoying girl decided yesterday to sit with us too, and man, f*ck her for ruining it for me. Goddamn. You ever see the opening scenes of Fight Club, where he gets mad at Marla for coming to his testicular cancer meeting? That's how this felt. Anyway I pretend to be friends with her sometimes and sometimes she's fine talking to, but really the best I can explain her is a 6th grader in our room of 10th graders. Anyway if she sits with us again on Monday instead of her usual crowd, I will be beyond pissed off. I will transform into the semi-usual asshole I can be, but only when she talks.
