My life has felt like itâ€™s at such a roadblock recently Itâ€™s mostly bc I have to get a nasal swab done for covid before school and Iâ€™m a little freaked about it and itâ€™s making it hard to think about the future 

But even then I have to move up to college and live a â€œnormalâ€ life? And I have to get work done?? Will my social life be non-existent? Will school even be opened for the whole sem?? Itâ€™s such a unknown time I hate it
