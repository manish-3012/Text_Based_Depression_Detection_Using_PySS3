The police pulled up behind me today I was just sitting in my car waiting for my sister to get out of school and apparently I was in a No Parking zone.

I had never noticed the signs and just assumed it was okay because it was where I was always picked up throughout middle school and where everyone parks.

Needless to say, Iâ€™ll be parking somewhere else.
