I finally got a boyfriend but covid got in the way of our date. I just really want to talk about this because I am so happy and so frustrated at the same time.

About a week ago this guy and I(17M) became a couple, we met online and have talked for hours everyday. At first when I hinted at the idea of being boyfriends he said he wanted to wait but soon after he said that I am so sweet and kind and cute that he changed his mind and asked me if I wanted to be a couple.

We had planned on going on a date tomorrow (with precautions obviously) but then his room mate started feeling sick so we have to cancel. I'm just so frustrated because this would have been my first date and I had so much planned out. 

I know it's a bit strange to call it official before the first date but I'm not exactly normal either.
