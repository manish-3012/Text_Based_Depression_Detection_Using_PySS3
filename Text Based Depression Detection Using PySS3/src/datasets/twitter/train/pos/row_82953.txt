Iâ€™m deleting this app! So basically, I have been seeing so many people deleting this app for reasons such as school, addictions, and other stuff. I decided that I also have responsibilities, which made me think of the cause. Itâ€™s not too hard to guess, but I finally realized that most of us here are only here because we can be. We are all just people wasting time on this app, or maybe even on other social media apps. 

I have noticed a significant loss of sleep because Iâ€™m always  on reddit right before falling asleep. I keep my phone under my pillow in case I get bored at night. The one thing I always do when Iâ€™m bored is... you guessed it... scroll through this app. 

Iâ€™m also sitting on my ass all day scrolling. Itâ€™s not because I want to become unhealthy, but because I canâ€™t stop. I have gained at least 10 pounds since quarantine started, and I can trace that back to my lack of time management on reddit. 

And my last reason is my grades. My dad was super pissed after seeing this yearâ€™s grades. I got a ton of Bs instead of As, and yes, my dad is Asian. Even so, if my performance gets worse, I canâ€™t even count the consequences. 

Iâ€™m sorry if this was hard to read, but I hope I at least got my point across just to say that we should all pay more attention to things that actually matter. And this is NOT hate for reddit or this subreddit. The reason I was talking about reddit is because itâ€™s one of the only ones I have. Bye guys! It was fun! 

I might come on here every once in a while, but for now, I will delete this app.
