Socialising during the big bad virus Hi I'm curious of what you people are doing for social interaction during this period, are you meeting up in person, with social distancing, video calls, etc. 

In the UK the current guidelines are: you can meet up in groups of 6, outside with social distancing. I live in rural england where there has been very low cases and the deaths can be counted on one hand. 

I've met up with my friends a bunch of times as a group without social distancing, we don't wear masks and are almost always outside, we share food and stuff and tbh kinda act like the whole covid situation doesn't exist. Our reasoning is that when we go back to school in september, there will be no social distancing and no masks and thats only a month away, we live in a very isolated area and the number of cases are extremely low (my parents are doctors in the area, this is how I know).

 I'm curious to hear what you people have been doing for social interaction as every group of people my age I've seen has been without social distancing or masks and just acting like things are normal. Things will greatly vary between countries so if you are talking about your social activities please specify where you're from.
