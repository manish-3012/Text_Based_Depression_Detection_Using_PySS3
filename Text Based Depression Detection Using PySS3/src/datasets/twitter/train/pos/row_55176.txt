My 7 year old brother is getting into anime I was watching JJBA in the lounge and my 7 year old brother sat with me to watch it. He was interested. So then he decided to watch an anime on his own. He first watched Beyblade and he loved it. Now we would watch Naruto together at night and he freaking loves it as well. He would sometimes sit down and watch JJBA with me as well when I would be watching. His favorite character is old Joseph and Jotaro lmao. I am really happy tho since we both didnt exactly have anything in common before and now he is gaining an interest in something I really like as well.

I am witnessing a weeb grow up
