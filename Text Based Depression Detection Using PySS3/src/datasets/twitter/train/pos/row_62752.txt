Snapchat question So, I recently deleted my Snapchat and brought it back like a day or two later, but now Iâ€™ve brought it back Iâ€™m no longer in anyoneâ€™s private stories, when I was in like three different private stories when I deleted my account but when I brought it back I can longer see it. So does deleting your Snapchat remove you from peopleâ€™s private stories? Cause I donâ€™t know wanna just ask them cause if theyâ€™ve removed me that would be mad awkward ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’€
