A problem I've realized is That mental health is more important than your grades. Unless your mental health is causing you to do poorly on your school work. Then your grades are more important again.

I don't know how to contact the school counseling center and it's midnight here so I can't call the therapists that my old one gave me to look at before coming here and schedule an appointment because there's nobody to answer the phone and ugh why did I have to be cursed with the most severe anxiety disorder in existence
