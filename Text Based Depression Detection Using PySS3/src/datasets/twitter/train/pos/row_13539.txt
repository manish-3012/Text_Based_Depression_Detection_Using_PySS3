Ok: a dating app, but exclusively for rich people How would that even work? Can't people just easily fake their wealth? Yes, that is why this app costs $100. Because only a rich person would have the money to throw around to get such an unreasonably expensive app that may or may not serve them any use.

Thoughts on this?
