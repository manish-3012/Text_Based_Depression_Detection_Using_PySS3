I'm going to go mad I'm a straight male, and my opinions dont matter, nethier what I say, so i cant say a lot of things, I'm starting to feel like the LGBT and BLM flag on someone's username is a badge of "my opinion is better than yours" NOT THAT IM HOMOPHOBIC, it's just what I feel, and everything is turning for the worst. Everything here in the US is starting to burn, I never thought I would say this but we are under a lot of political, etc. pressure and I feel this country is going to  go into a deeper hole of chaos, I mean shootings are starting to break out between protesters vs protesters and soon I think there will be malita style groups going against each other, please send help.
