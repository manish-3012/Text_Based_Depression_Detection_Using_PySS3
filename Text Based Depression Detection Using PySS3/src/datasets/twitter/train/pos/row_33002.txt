The girl of my dreams went back home today:( One of my close friends for all of elementary school moved away when I was in the 10th grade (about 2 years ago), and I didnâ€™t really see her that much since. We stayed in touch over social media, but as people usually do, we drifted apart. We werenâ€™t in any kind of relationship nor did we have any romantic ties when she moved away, I think we both just had crushes on each other we were too scared to say anything about :). About a month ago she texts me saying sheâ€™ll be coming back to my town for a month to house sit for this friend of her dadâ€™s. We spent this past month together and Jesus Christ does this girl own my ass now. She is literally who I want to be with. I donâ€™t care how ridiculous it is. I donâ€™t want to be with anyone else. I donâ€™t tend to let people in and tell them how I feel that easily, but with her it felt like the easiest thing in the whole world. We both agree that if we lived in the same place we could be in a relationship together, but sadly she lives about 1,017 miles away from where I do. Shit really frustrates me. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna be able to keep my life going after this. I donâ€™t know what to do. I gave my heart to this girl and now sheâ€™s just.... gone. Iâ€™m a little heart broken right now. Iâ€™m gonna go drive up and visit her in a month or two but I canâ€™t help but worry for our future and the heartbreak thatâ€™ll come with it. Thank you for reading if you didâ£ï¸
