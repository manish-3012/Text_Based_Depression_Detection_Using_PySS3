Warning: Predators Lurk Here In my last post about racial preferences in dating, this one user dmed me to send a selfie because heâ€™s bored. I told them I would only do that if we sent them on snap. Once I sent him a snap of my &lt;teenage face&gt;, he sent a selfie. He was a 50-something year old. I took a screenshot of him, and blocked him, but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m allowed to post it here. Please be careful
