Restaurants give me anxiety ill probably never go in and eat in one willingly, and they're like usually all dark and too many people and it's overrated asf. Plus tipping is bullshit and you can't make me give you a tip if I don't even go lmao. Mcdonalds is the only rare exception, cause I can just order on the touch screen and don't have to talk to nobody and I do still get anxious in there but I can sit for a few mins.
