I have not texted my gf , and I'm waiting to see if she would So I'm always the one who start the conversation , who text hello and that kind of things , so yesterday I have to texted her since her B-day party . I'm waiting to see if she going to text first time , it has been almost a day without texting . Am I weird or something ?
