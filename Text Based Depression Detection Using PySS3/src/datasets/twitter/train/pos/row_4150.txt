You can keep scrolling I don't know why I'm writing this but here goes.
Sometimes I feel like I truly don't deserve happiness or anything of the like. It feels weird to give a genuine smile. I think that sometimes it'd be better off if I were to just disappear or not even exist. My life is fine, my family is nice and all, but I feel like I don't deserve to have a family like them. My birthday is coming up soon and this wave just hits like, should I even celebrate it, I haven't done anything worthwhile. Maybe I'm secretly starving for attention or something, who knows. I don't like to give myself much credit for the good things I do because I hate making myself think that I'm a "good" person. Now my head hurts thinking about this. If you're still reading, idk why you decided to read the whole thing, but thats just you I guess.
