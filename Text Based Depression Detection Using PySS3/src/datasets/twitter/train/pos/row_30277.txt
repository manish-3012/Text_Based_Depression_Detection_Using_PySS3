Let me rant real quick So I just had the worst dream in my life and thereâ€™s no one else for me to tell but you guys do here we go.

So basically there I was at a toilet taking a shit, you know the usual stuff. But the problem wasnâ€™t the shit itself if anything the shit was PHENOMENAL. The problem was that EVERY SINGLE TIME I TRIED TO WIPE, THE SHIT WOULDNT GO AWAY. I COULD EFFIN FEEL IT LINGER AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Then I awoke up and the end.

Anyways this post was made by sit wipe gang.
