A bestfriend I think in my group of friends i dont have A bestfriend, i have a childhood friend in the group but we don't talk a lot like we used to, i have friend who talks to me thru dms but i dont think she counts me as a bestfriend, i would like to think she is my bestfriend but i don't think she counts me as one, i think she looks at me as like a close friend. I'm just talking about this cause no one is talking to me anymore personally, we communicate through Groupchats, all i wanted is to talk to someone but yet i failed for doing so cause i got no bestfriend to talk too, i just wanted  someone to tell me if I'm doing alright or "hey,you okay? We haven't talk in awhile" i just miss those moments...
I think this is just nonsense, im sorry for wasting your time, but thank you for hearing me out the internet
