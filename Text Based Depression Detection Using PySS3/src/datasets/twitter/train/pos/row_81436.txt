bout to go to a fucking car wash who even cleans their cars at these things anyways? well ig I do now. I like having dirt on my car it looks sexy. My car got egged and I am too lazy to clean it myself plus my back kinda hurts. and I donâ€™t want the egg to sit on my paint and wear it down. So now Iâ€™m resorting to a car wash. Also my friendâ€™s dad owns a shop in town and it got its window smashed in. Teenagers are so dumb. Stop trying to make peopleâ€™s lives harder! Do things to lift others up! Not bring them down!
