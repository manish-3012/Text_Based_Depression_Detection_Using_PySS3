Letâ€˜s talk about supersexuality Supersexuality-a more or less objective view

 

First,  let's start off by saying that I am not part of the recently emerged  superstraight movement. I do not want do be associated with them,  because some of its members spread Nazi ideology and hate against trans  people, which is not okay (there are enough examples of this- the most  obvious one being some superstraight folks having the glorious idea to  use the short form double S for their movement).

Anyway  though, I think that they do have a point- up until now, everyone has  encouraged different kinds of sexuality (which is, for me, absolutely  what you should do). Basically, there [are so many](https://www.healthline.com/health/different-types-of-sexuality#why-it-matters)  of them (which again, is totally fine), that you can pretty much choose  whatever you think suits you best. Now that some people, who feel only  attracted to women/men born with the gender they have now (cis) have  decided to call that a sexuality (others claim it's just a genital  preference), it seems like half of the internet supports them and the  other half diguises them for being transphobic.

So  first, I want to say that it does seem weird for the  LGBTQ+ community  (and their supporters) to say that supersexuality is not a real  sexuality, because, as I pointed out, literally everything is possible  in terms of sexuality, so why not supersexuality? Well, some people  might argue that it is transphobic. But is it?

That leads us to the main point of this debate: DOES SUPERSEXUALITY MAKE YOU TRANSPHOBIC?

The question is, in my opinion, really complexe.

The justification for calling supersexuality invalid (as [r/superstraightphobic](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstraightphobic/)  does it) is-in short- that supersexuality is to some extent trasphobic.  The argumentation is to say that, the same way you cannnot decide not  to date any asian or black person, because that would be-according to  the justifications-racist, you can't just exclude trans people from your  dating wish list. Now this is a really complicated statement, that is  going to divide the internet. Is dating- or declining a date based on  their race or history of gender (I hope you know what I mean) wrong? So  to bring in the idea of sexuality. This is the fundamental question we  have to answer. I think everyone has a different opinion on this.

I  have gathered here a few arguments that are used in the debate, feel  free to complete the ist in the comments. As an example, we will always  take two people who want to date with the goal of sex (for both)  somewhere in the future. Just for an example: two gay men date=have a  healthy and emotional relationship  and then start having sex=both are  happy

\#1: as it has been pointed  out by feminist movements: any reason for declining sex is valid. No one  should be coerced to have sexual intercourse, thus every motive of  denying sex is valid.

\#2: if you  are not sexually attracted to someone (might it be because whatever-too  tall, too small, brown eyes-whatever you don't like), that should be  enough of an argument not to date someone, thus joining my first point

\#3  No one except you can understand whom you feel sexually attracted to,  so no one should criticize you when you come out with a new sexuality

\#4  Only because you are not sexually attracted to something (let's take  potatoes as an example) does not necesserily mean that you hate potatoes  and that you want to burn them all- it just means you don't want to  have sex with potatoes

\#5: once a person has changed its gender, it is not what it was before, not something in between, but the new gender

\#6:  by saying you are supersexual, you declare that you have not really  accepted that a person can change its gender- for you, it will always be  something in between

\#7: no one  forces you to date anyone. If you don't want to date a trans person  because they are trans, not everyone is going to like it, but just make  up whatever reason you like and say no. Being trans does not grant you  the right to date eeveryone, for every date the two parties must be  willing. the same is of course true for sex.

\#8: there are so few ([source)](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) trans people, that only really, really, really few people will ever be in the situaton of decling a date with a trans person.

\#9:  the whole superstraight movement might be argued to be a troll, just to  undermine LGBTQ+ folks and to show that there might be some  self-decided hypocrisy going on (whatever way you think about this  statement)

There  is no conclusion to this except: THINK, THINK for yourself, take every  argument into consideration and don't let this topic divide us, but  unite us in civil discussion. that is precisely what you should do now:  comment and discuss my ideas and statements, feel free to ask questions  and to downvote me into oblivion if you want, but remember: i am on  neither "side" of this arguement since I don't think we should fight  about it.

P.S. i will be trying to post this to different subs (to [r/superstraightphobic](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstraightphobic/) and to [r/SuperStraight](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperStraight/)  lets see where I will be taken down first) oh and to the mods who might  read this: if you take the post down, please take my points into  cnsideration at least, it has taken me a while to write this.
