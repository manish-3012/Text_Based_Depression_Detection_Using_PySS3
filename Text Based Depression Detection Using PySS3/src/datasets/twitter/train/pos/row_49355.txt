I fucking hate Reddit I'm trying to upload an image to a subreddit but they completely changed it on mobile and the stupidest fucking change I have ever witnessed

It's EMBARRASSING for Reddit, they should be completely embarrassing and ashamed, like who the fuck decided this was a good change? They are actually fucking stupid

Before you'd tap upload image, then you'd see your gallery which is all your photos in order, and then you could pick one of your gallery folders to find it easier

Now it's fucking stupid, it's actually braindead, whoever made this decision should be shot

It brings up just one catagory called "Recents", no more folders, and the photos are completely out of order, like completely, the top photos are like from months ago while I've added like 100 photos after, I litterally can't find my photo I want to upload anymore because of this change

The photo I want to upload is the most recent photo on my phone, and I just can't find it, it's not at the top where you'd think it would be, it's somewhere randomly on a list of 500+ photos

Completely ruined my day I fucking hate Reddit they can't even get uploading photos right like what every other social media platform has gotten right for YEARS! Reddit is behind the curve, it's embarrassing
