I dare you to go to the YT trending page for gaming, and tell me what you find. Among us characters looking like they just goy out of an anime convention? Yep. All fucking over. I go to the trending page to try to find new content, new game on the rise maybe, not find people damaging their vocal cords with how high there voice is, I mean, YouTube kids? Nahhhhhh. Regular YouTube for the real men watching among us with mind control while having their eardrums blown out by pitch. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk
