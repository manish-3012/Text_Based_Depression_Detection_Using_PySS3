My dad expects too much from me I got lectured from my dad out of nowhere. I'd expect a conversation to spark but nothing like this. I'm turning 16 soon and he's telling me to "step it up" but yet during that time  he talked about all the cons I have in my life.  The problem with me is I always think of him first before I think of myself. I feel like that's a bad thing to do, I  need to work on that. I play football I think about football sometimes but other times I just think about things that could possibly change Imy future but he thinks I should just talk about football and nothing but football. He wants me to be him but it's my life I'm talking about. God help me.
