A church retreat delema (need advice) My mother keeps fucking begging me to do this church retread for Friday through Sunday in nebraska. She forced me to do this boring ass bible study every Wednesday (which is the same girl doing the retreat). I absolutely am going to hate the retreat. They're going to do activities and other church stuff. My mom thinks we're going to like visit Nebraska and actually go places but I highly doubt it. Have any one of you had experience?I need help convincing her it's not going to be a good time for me. I don't want to do this and I don't have much time, Please help.
