Air Force Reserves Hey guys, 

I want to join the Air Force reserves and I tried talking to my polish mom about it and it didnâ€™t go well. She said she â€œdisagreesâ€ with it and says I will die, when Iâ€™m not even joining infantry, I donâ€™t even know if there is an infantry MOS for the Air Force. Iâ€™m 18, idk if Iâ€™m still allowed on this sub but thought Iâ€™d share. To continue the recruitment process I need my social security card and my birth certificate, and my mom wonâ€™t give them to me. Should I go the legal way, if there is one? Or should I socially engineer this by asking my older sister to help with the situation, and my moms friends? Iâ€™m lost and not sure to do, also kinda scared cause since Iâ€™m 18 she could kick me out of her house, which is a possibility but probably unlikely. Iâ€™ll consider all options.
