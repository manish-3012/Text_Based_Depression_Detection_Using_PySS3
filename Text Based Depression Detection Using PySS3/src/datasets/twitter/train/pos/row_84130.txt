My dad makes my entire life hell. So Iâ€™ve posted many times about my dad before *then would delete the posts*.
Iâ€™d just like to talk about some stuff he has done.

Once I had thrush on my tongue. I was given these drops to put on it (theyâ€™re disgusting). Iâ€™ve had them before so I knew what dose I was meant to have. The pharmacist gave me the wrong instructions. I knew what I was meant to take tho so it was fine. My dad got mad at me for not taking the amount I was told. My mum was working so she didnt see this happen. She also knew from last time how much I was meant to have. I think I was meant to have half a pipette. The pharmacist said 4 of them. Thatâ€™s obv a massive difference. My dad ended up grabbing me and forcing more of them in my mouth and was getting very aggressive. He even said â€œsometimes I wish I could strangle youâ€. When mum was on her break, dad called her and talked shit about me. Mum called the pharmacy and guess what? I was right. Dad never even apologised to me.

Another thing is that I have zero privacy. I am FTM trans (closeted cause dad is transphobic). So I have a female body. My parents donâ€™t allow me to have the bathroom door shut cause they think Iâ€™m hiding something. Dad has walked past many times and saw me.. without clothes on and once he stared a bit too long for my liking. He didnâ€™t do it in a NSFW way.. just looked. Heâ€™s also done many other things that make me uncomfortable. Heâ€™s not a.. ya know. But he does just make me uncomfortable.

Heâ€™s also mentally ab*sive.. I just hate being at this home.
