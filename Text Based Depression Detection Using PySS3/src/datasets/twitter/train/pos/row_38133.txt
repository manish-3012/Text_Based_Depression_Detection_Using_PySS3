Worried about a guinea hen chick I recently got some Guinea Hen Chicks and one of them isnâ€™t doing so hot. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with them and my mom said that if it has what she thinks it has, it might be better to put it out of its misery. Iâ€™m scared and stressed, Iâ€™m keeping it in my room away from the others in case it was injured or is contagiously sick. Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s just a non fatal birth defect, because if it is then perhaps we can get help or maybe we can keep it as a pet rather than a farm animal.
