Repressed Memory Just remembered the time at Irish college(pretty much summer camp) a friend of mine thought it would be really funny to start walking up to random girls and asking them if theyd go out with me. Unsurprisingly most were "No"s but the "Eww"s were really what killed me. I had repressed that memory and hadn't thought about in like 3+ years, wish I had just never remembered that
