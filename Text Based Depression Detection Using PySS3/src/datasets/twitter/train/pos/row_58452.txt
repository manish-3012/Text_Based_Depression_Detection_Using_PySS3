so, i told my crush i liked them. the title says it all. last night, at around 2:10-12 AM, i just said â€˜i love you.â€™ i explained it further, and it kinda just happened. it felt really weird tbh because i honestly didnâ€™t expect my fantasies to come true. their response, though, was preeetty cool. it was kinda shakey, but i did it. it became reality. i guess iâ€™m pretty happy (nervous, too.) hell, iâ€™m still confused that it even happened: it felt and still feels like a fever dream. 

so my advice to thee: do it, coward. set a deadline, however small or large it is. i just aligned it to the crescendo of my favourite song (though i replayed it a bit,) as a mini-deadline of fanfare and terrifying terrific trembles. donâ€™t be a pussy. 

this will self destruct in 5 seconds to 5 minutes to 5 hours.
