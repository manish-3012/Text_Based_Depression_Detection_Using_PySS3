I just thought about something murdering babies is good if you're religious and believe in heaven and hell.

think about it: if you're a serial killer that kills babies, and you murder 1000 babies in your life, you're going to send them to heaven (because they're too stupid to sin). you're also saving those babies from having a life with a lot of suffering and you're also preventing them from going to hell in case they sin too much.

sure, you might go to hell, but you're sending 1 person to hell (yourself) for 1000 other people. you're essentially sacrificing yourself for the babies. that's a pretty honorable thing to do.
