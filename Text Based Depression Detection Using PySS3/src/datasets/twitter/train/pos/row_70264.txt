My Classmate asked me that if she has a crush on me does she have a chance with me I said yes between 0% and 100&amp;. I've personally never been in this situation before and I'm now confused. She also told me that if i have a crush on her i have a chance. My mind is split into two now. Confess to her and maybe get her or not Confess to her and Maintain status quo.   


God i'm confused right now. I guess i'll just take the latter just to be safe.
