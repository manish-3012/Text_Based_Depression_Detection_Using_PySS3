Iâ€™m sorry but if you hate someone because theyâ€™re popular, thatâ€™s just sad Why do you have to hate someone just because theyâ€™re different and know how to talk to people? 

Donâ€™t say â€œall popular kids are assholes!â€ Cause Iâ€™ve met plenty of kids that were popular and they were nice people. 

I know thatâ€™s not the case for everyone, but still. Kinda sad that you hate someone just because they like talking to people and are extroverted
