ranking the black parade imo 14. blood - hidden track 

its fucking awful why does this song have to exist 

13. sleep 

its a decent song, i don't ever listen to it really tho, the others just outshine it so much 

12. mama 

again it's decent but i never really listen to it, it's just ok 

11. house of wolves 

pretty overrated imo, still a good song tho 

10. disenchanted 

at first i really liked this but it's fallen down my favourites on the album recently 

9. i don't love you 

the worst of all the great songs imo 

8. dead! 

its just great init 

7. the end. 

a great intro to the album, plus i listen to it a lot cos it's so short lol 

6. the sharpest lives

the worst of the absolute bangers imo 

5. teenagers 

brilliant song, an anthem for us lol, buuut i overplayed it for myself so much, shame on me 

4. cancer 

lyrically one of the better songs on this album, very sad in a good way 

3. this is how i disappear

underrated banger here, love this song sm

2. famous last words 

would be the perfect ending if blood - hidden track would just fuck off 

1. welcome to the black parade 

honestly a flawless song, should be the first or at least second track on the album tho, would fit there perfectly
