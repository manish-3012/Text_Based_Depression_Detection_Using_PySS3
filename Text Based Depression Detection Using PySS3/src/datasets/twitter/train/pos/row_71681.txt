I finally got a skirt! So I finally gathered enough courage to ask my mom to go shopping. Now, she was a bit confused cause I never want to go shopping, but she agreed to drive me there. When we got in I directed her towards ladies section and immediately noticed this wonderful skirt. I take it off the rack, and my mom is like, *wtf is my son doing*, but then I say that Iâ€™m done, so we go check out. My mom has this horrific expression the whole time, but never tried to stop me. When I got home I immediately put it on and it looks fabulous! 

When I woke up I thought, *at least I can be a femboy in my dreams*
