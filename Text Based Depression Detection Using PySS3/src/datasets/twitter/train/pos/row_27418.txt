My grades are dropping and I'm panicking, but my motivation is so dead i don't know what to do [vent] I just got another two bad grades and i thought I understood it??? But it appears that I don't understand anything and this stupid ass teacher has this FUCKING ANNOYING VOICE AND SHE ALWAYS JUST TALKS IN THIS TONE THAT JUST ASKS FOR SOMEONE TO PUNCH HER IN HER STUPID FACE. FUCK YOU. I DON'T GET IT, WHY CAN'T YOU HELP ME?? ISN'T IT YOUR JOB TO HELP PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE??? JUST SHIT THE FUCK UP AND STOP TALKING WITH YOUR ANNOYING, STUPID VOICE, IT LITERALLY MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP AND NOT LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID ASS.


I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Why is the test so much harder than our classes? And why i am that one student that struggles the most. I want a bad student in 8th grade... Why am i so bad now. Why is it so much harder and why is everyone mad at me for not being as good as in elementary school :( it's overwhelming and boring and i don't like it. There's just other things that are more interesting than her annoying voice. I just wish I could stop the time, finally catch up and then start the time finally being able to go the same pace as others. But i can't and it's hard to catch up when so many things are new and hard and there's just nothing about them in those useless books :( it's like I'm the only one that's struggling so much. It's exhausting, i wish i could just sleep, sleep forever without worrying about grades and parents who just say "try harder", and those stupid thoughts, and all the other kids in my class who are doing so well without trying. Just nothing, nobody, finally some peace and quiet
