Somewhat new to minecraft and I have a question So I got a new pc for christmas and got minecraft as I had sort of played it before but never made a deep run. A few days later and I have stockpiled 13 blocks worth of iron and found 16 diamonds, excluding the 3 I turned into a pick.

 Im preparing for the nether and I have a question. Would it be smarter to make armour with the diamonds or tools? My diamond pick is about to break and I have enough iron to make a new set of armour if I go for iron tools, but I can also make some diamond armour. Whats the pick?
