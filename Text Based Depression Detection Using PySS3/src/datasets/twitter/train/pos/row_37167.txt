I just don't understand why I need to go to school Ever since 1st grade I felt that school was slow, and I don't remember the last time I actually learned something new which was also important. I learn math externally and I already know English and all of the other classes are not important for me. I feel like I just waste my time. Where I live, you have to go to school by LAW until 11th grade, for some reason. I have many friends in school but school just isn't fun. My parents don't want me to quit even when I will be able to, and I just feel helpless because I can't really do anything about it. School is ruining my sleep, my mental health and is wasting my time.  
Fuck my shitty "education" system for making me do this shit for 12 years. I don't know what I did wrong that I deserve this much of prison time.
