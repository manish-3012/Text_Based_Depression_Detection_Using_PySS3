I think I just started a Minecraft war So I joined this Minecraft realm with a bunch of other random people a while back and we've been playing together everyday. We have a town with everybody's bases and stuff there, we've all just kinda lived peacefully together while exploring and building stuff. 

Recently, this guy has been using my nether portal I built right next to my house and has some chests right next to it with all his nether stuff. I was completely fine with that up until they made my portal much bigger and decorated it with nether themed stuff. I had been planning to take my portal down for a while and move it in my basement, so after they did that I decided to take it down. I left a sign telling them they couldn't rebuild and decorate it again.

Well this dude did not listen. They rebuilt the nether portal, but this time it was fucking huge. They used over 4 stacks of obsidian to build it. I spend a long time taking it down. Judging by their reaction the last time I told him no and took it down, the next time would be much worse. So I had to do something.

I stole and hid all of his netherite/diamond stuff. This isn't just stuff they could get back easily, they would have to spend days, even weeks, trying to get it back. I left a book saying that if they steal any of my stuff, grief any of my stuff, or rebuild the portal I would destroy it all. I also moved all my valuables, including my pets, to my secret base so they couldn't steal those and try to blackmail me.

We'll see where this leads. I think they're gonna be hella pissed when they see what I've done.
