Sometimes I mentally repeat words I hear/read Say im reading a piece of text...

blah blah blah...blah blah....door smashed into a shiny car, part of that sentence will just "pop out" or something, like I will repeat it in my head. 

For example, I was browsing in a subreddit...and the text PUA(no clue what it means) was on the picture, only word I saw. Mentally, and without thinking about it, I mentally repeated it. 

Sometimes when I hear "Bon ami" (cleaning product) I will out of the blue say "bon ami mon ami" 

Randomly say/repeat lyrics of something, ect. 

Doesn't happen really often, I don't ever remember a first time doing it, so I think I have done this for a while but it only really caught my attention recently. 

anyone else have some odd quirk like this? 

Idk...there are better places to ask this, ik.
