THIS IS A CALL TO ACTION PLEASE READ Hello Teenagers,
I make a lot of shitposts and posts that are shit on this sub, but this time Iâ€™m in need of help. Right now my school district has a schedule that goes 4 periods one day, the next four the next day, and so on and so forth. But, there have been rumors and evidence that higher ups plan to change the schedule half way through the year. This would not be a good change because it would disrupt a lot of studentâ€™s schedule and put an even stronger mental strain on people than normal due to Covid and quarantine. The whole day would be sitting in a chair for about 6 hours while the days right now are four. The new schedule would have every class every day, while right now weâ€™re used to 4 periods a day, 4 periods the next. Please, if you support my cause to keep a sense of normalcy during these depressing times, support my petition. It really means a lot.
