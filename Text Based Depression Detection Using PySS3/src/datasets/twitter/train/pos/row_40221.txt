A PUBLISHER JUST GOT BACK TO ME REGAURDING A POEM I SUBMITED So, a few days ago, I submitted a poem to a publishing company, hoping to get minimal feedback from professionals, but instead, they're interested in MY WORK. And it's not like, I'm 18 so this is common, I'm 15, and submitted a poem to a professional publishing company, and they are interested in more of my work, not only that, but they got back to me in only 3 DAYS, that is a VERY short time for a submission! Anyways, I'm freaking out, that's all I wanted to say bye.
