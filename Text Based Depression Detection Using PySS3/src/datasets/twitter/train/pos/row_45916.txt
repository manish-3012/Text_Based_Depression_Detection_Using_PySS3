how the hecc do i ask my parents this question so, heres a little backstory/context;

my online best friend that i have known for almost 5 years confessed her feelings for me, and now were dating! :) i couldnt be happier


anyway, onto the actual part of the reason i posted this-

i want to ask my parents if i could visit her, i live in alaska and she lives in pennsylvania- me and her have been talking about it for a while and we think it would be really great for us

my parents have known about her for a while but i only told them not even a full 24 hours ago that were dating

how do i ask them about this? i dont wanna dump to much on them at once, and i dont even know what to say when i do ask- help
