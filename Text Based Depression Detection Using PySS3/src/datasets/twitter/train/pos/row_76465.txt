I know I donâ€™t have much to be sad about I also have nothing to be happy about. I live in the Corona capital of the world and all my smiles are always fake unless Iâ€™m around my friends.

Sure nothing bad has happened directly to me but Iâ€™m surrounded by all this death, dread and everything bad. There is people, unlike this privileged middle class kid, that live in poverty. They donâ€™t deserve that, but I donâ€™t know how to help them. Iâ€™m just sad
