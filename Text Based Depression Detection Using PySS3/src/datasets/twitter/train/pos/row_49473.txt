I'm having a crisis I just read a post by u/Ventmachine1 about him asking if he had dysphoria or something similar and I found I related to alot of things in the post, he explained that he was submissive and shy and that he acted alot more feminine then most guys, I also experience all of these things and sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be a girl and I picture it in my head from time to time.

Idfk what to do, do I have dysphoria or am I just overthinking?
