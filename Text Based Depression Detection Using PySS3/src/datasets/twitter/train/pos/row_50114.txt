One of my close friends is dating some homophobic kid who wants to beat up gays No joke. He gets into alot of fights with people, he challenged me but I don't know shit about fighting and hes calling me a pussy bitch and whatnot. I don't wanna sound like some incel or niceguy but SERIOUSLY, what do girls see in guys like him??
