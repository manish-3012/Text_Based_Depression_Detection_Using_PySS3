7:00 pm: finished my ELA assignment. dad checked it over. found a bunch of mistakes. made me do it again. cried because i had to do it again. did it again.

8:00 pm: got distracted. dad threatened to take the power cord of my pc if i didnt get to work. got to work.

8:30 pm: finally finished my ELA assignment to my dads liking. dad let me listen to a podcast before bed becasue i worked all day today. tried to start my podcast. couldnt because i was locked out of my phone because i have a dumb parental control app on there.

long story short, i did schoolwork for the entire time i was awake today. :)
