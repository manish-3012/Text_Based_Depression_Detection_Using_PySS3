I feel like politics are getting shoved down my throat I always see race or political shit on tiktok. I've blocked multiple accounts that talk about it, and videos that appear, BUT THEY WONT GO AWAY. And with the recent asian hate crimes, and BLM, people are always talking about race on any platform. I recently even saw a post on this sub on how asian hate crimes are by black people band not white people. (But if I said what I wanted to say on that subject I think I'd get doxxed lmao)

Anyways to summarize this. LIFE SUCKS
