Existential dread, anyone? ayo, im just gonna scream into the void, dont mind me.  


lately, things have been... weird. nothing feels like it is really happening, its just white noise going on in the background. everything seems so removed from reality, so unreal. i dont have the same values as others around me, i dont think like others, i dont act like others. i feel so out of wack. like im just a spectator in the world.   
I cant concentrate. everything feels like its going on in a thick fog around me. i have started to have brief periods of times where its like a flashbang went off in my brain, where i cant think, i cant remember anything, and i can barely see.  
I dont feel the right emotions at the right times. i laugh at bad times, i make jokes to try to bear with myself, but it gains only the ire of others. i dont feel happy at well, much of anything. most of what i feel now is just irritation and fatigue.   
i cant talk to people correctly. online is one thing, but irl i am so different from online. i have totally different personalities in different situations. online, i know what to say, and i know what to do, but irl, it just feels so weird, so alien. i know exactly what the other person is going to say and how they will say it in response to what i say, but i have no clue what to say.  
I complain about being lonely, bur internally, i know that i prefer being alone, because whenever im with others, i get exhausted, and they get irritated.  
I hate not being good enough. i used to be the smart kid, the "gets an A+ in every class even though he just reads the whole class" kid. now look at me, im just a hormone-ridden mess of a redditor.  


TL;DR: fml
