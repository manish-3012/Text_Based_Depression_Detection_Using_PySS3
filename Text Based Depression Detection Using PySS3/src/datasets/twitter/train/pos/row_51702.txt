about the universal healthcare thing in America soo I think it would be great but I donâ€™t want universal healthcare in America. not only would it shit on the economy but the good healthcare we have and high paying jobs in healthcare would go to shit too. we would have way worse healthcare bc of untrained staff and the amount these people would get payed would go down. not to mention how much of the lower pay would get taxed by the government. soo yeah thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve found but Iâ€™m open to discussion about this. that is why I made the post so I could be wrong so if you have a comment just comment. again Iâ€™m open to other teens research.
