Step by step instructions on how to correct the blanket in the middle of the night without turning on the light If you are having trouble with this problem, read carefully. I have studied the art of blanket correcting at 2AM for many years, and I would like to share this knowledge with the community. After the longest time, I've found the answer.

Step 1: Find an edge. It can be any edge. Don't worry if it's the side for now. The easiest one to find is the one directly under your chin.

Step 2: take one hand and hold the edge. Put the other hand next to it and run it along the edge until you find a corner

Step 3: Hold the corner with that hand. Run the other hand the opposite direction until you find the other corner across from you. Pay close attention to how far the corners are apart from each other as this will be important later. We will call this length A

Step 4: Once you find both corners, use your legs to straighten the blanket out

Since the blanket is now flat, you can use a simple trick to figure out weather or not the blanket is the correct orientation. (If you have a square blanket, you're finished)

Step 5: Take one of your hands off one corner and grab the other corner. With your free hand, run it down one of the edges on the side of you until you find the 3rd corner (you will have to turn the blanket 90 degrees). We will call this length B

Step 6: Compare the length from corners 1 &amp; 2 (A) with the length from corners 2 &amp; 3 (B). If A&gt;B, you did it. Straighten the blanket with your feet and go back to sleep. If A&lt;B, turn the blanket back 90 degrees the other direction. Straighten it with your feet.

Hopefully this guide helps!
