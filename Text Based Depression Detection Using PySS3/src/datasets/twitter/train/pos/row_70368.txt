Day 29 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. "Don't try to make me feel better. I want to touch. I want to be touched. I want to hurt. I want to be hurt. And if you feel the same way, you're as bad as me. I was hoping you'd say, 'get behind me' or 'I rebuke you' like you're supposed to. Won't you let me feel like a real devil for a moment?" - Jupiter
