I don't get how Asian hate became so relevant here in America It feels like the media just wanted to talk about more racism in America once BLM died down and I think that coverage created more problems than it is solving. For stuff like BLM, there has been a major cause of concern because racism towards Black Americans is deeply rooted into our history as a country; for Asian hate, though, we never learned much about it in history and this issue just sort of popped up because nothing else controversial was going on. Before I start sounding like a racist too, can someone point out the major patterns of Asian hate *before* the news started blowing it up?
