Oh the fucking irony My father preaches about time management all the time, but instead of asking my brother who literally isnâ€™t doing anything right now he says,â€ on your next break the dogs need to be fed.â€ Iâ€™m literally in school rn. Itâ€™s just mind boggling to me how my unemployed brother gets to play video games and do nothing all day while my sister and I have to cook, clean, take care of the dogs and my grandmother, and go to fucking school and do homework. And my dads excuse is always â€œthey changed your diapersâ€ or â€œyou have this task for a reasonâ€ blah blah bullshit.
