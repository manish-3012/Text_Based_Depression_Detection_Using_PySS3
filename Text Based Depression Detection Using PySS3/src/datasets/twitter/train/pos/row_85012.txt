How can I distance myself from a toxic family member My brother is really toxic and Im pretty sure he has an undiagnosed mental problem, I can't really distance myself from him since I live in the same small apartment as him and usually have to go in car rides together.

He's always looking for a fight, regardless if I'm nice to him.
