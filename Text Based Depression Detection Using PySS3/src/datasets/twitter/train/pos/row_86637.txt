Iâ€™m not sure if I have any real friends I have 3 friends and 2 of them are short and one gets hella offended when I call him half pint and the other doesnâ€™t care I talked to the third friend almost all last week but now he doesnâ€™t answer my texts and i made a meme about the one getting offered and the other not and I sent it to the one that gets doesnâ€™t offended I changed my Twitter pfp to a cursed pic of michal Jackson and the one that gets offended got really pist off so I changed it to a pic from titanfall 2 jack coppers helmet and I sent the same pic of Micheal Jackson to the one that doesnâ€™t get offended and he made it his pfp and I told the other about it and he got mad at me I already sent the meme to the one that doesnâ€™t get offended and he sent it to the one that does possibly ruining my friendship with him and he acts like a full dick a lot of the time and if I had any other friends I would probably just talk with them but I have nobody all my online friends play tik toks in the background when we play and any time I do something to the one that does get offended I always hate myself in the end and I get depressed for most the day and we and him usually talk all the time and now I just feel lost and sad Iâ€™m trying to find some good memes to cheer me up (thatâ€™s usually what i do) but nothing is working and I just feel emo sad and lonely
