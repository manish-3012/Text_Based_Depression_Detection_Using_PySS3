To anyone who has met their online friends, how did it go? What was the process to meeting them? I have a group of close friends Iâ€™ve been talking to/playing games with for a year. Weâ€™ve all FaceTimed and shared our lives with each other. Thereâ€™s really no red flags in sight. I want to be able to meet them this summer but I have strict parents. Thereâ€™s 4 of them and theyâ€™re the only people Iâ€™ve actually formed a bond with on the internet. I could use some wise words/advice from anyone whoâ€™s been through a similar situation
