My mom's creepy sense of humor One time I was walking in town with my parents, and we were talking about god knows what. 

Because we were in the town centre, a lot of kids were around and a little boy was in front of us doing kid stuff, running around and such.

My mom suddenly bends over, takes his hand and asks him, "Do you want to come with us?" and the boy visibly recoils and starts looking around to find his mom probably. My dad and I were watching this with a solid WTF written across our faces.

She just laughed it off and let go of his hand to catch up with my dad and I, since we continued walking while watching her.

After she caught up with us, I told her what she did was borderline attempted kidnapping and creepy, and the boy's mother must've gotten really worried. Mom told me I was being too serious and that she was just joking, to which I responded with "How would you feel if someone did that to me when I was his age?", and she shrugged it off by repeating that she was just joking around. My dad said nothing.

My mom has a lot of issues, but I would have never thought she'd do something as disturbing as this
