What the hell even is a pizza calzone? you might say that a pizza calzone is a pizza, but youre dead wrong.

quote: ''A pizza is savoury dish of Italian origin consisting of a round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients.

the definition only specified **one** round and flattened base of dough, making a pizza calzone **not** a pizza.

but what if a pizza calzone is actually a sandwich, let me explain.

the definition of a sandwich is:  ''a item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with a filling between them ''

This makes much more sense, as a calzone is basically just filling stuffed two pieces of bread. so thats the answer right? wrong. a sandwich is made up of **two** seperate pieces of bread, a calzone is made up of one.

what if i tell you, that a pizza calzone is a wrap?

the definition of a wrap is: A **wrap** is a food dish made with a soft flatbread wrapped around a filling.

but not even this is a right answer, a wrap has two loose ends!

my final answer is that a pizza calzone is a BURRITO! A BURRITO IS MADE OF **ONE** FLATTEND BASE OF DOUGH, FILLED WITH VARIOUS FILLINGS, AND THEN WRAPPED INTO A CILINDER WITH **NO** LOOSE ENDS!
