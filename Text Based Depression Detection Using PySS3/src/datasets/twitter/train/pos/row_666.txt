I take what people say too seriously sometimes I was told I looked tired yesterday and idk why I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about it. I had to pretend I didnâ€™t care but it bothered me. Once I was a leader in a group and I feel like I did a lot of the work. The teacher said that I donâ€™t even do much, he might have been joking but it hurt me so much
