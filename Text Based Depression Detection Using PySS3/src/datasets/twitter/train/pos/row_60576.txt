Did any of u get bullied for being poor Idk know about other people but its not fun when someone has to bother me just because almost all of my stuff are hand me downs  cause there not damaged and are pretty nice and its  hard enough when most of the day your family is just out working so you can pay rent.  And because we are never together theres a rift between me and my family and we dont get along except for my bro who acualy  cares about me and my interests  he is 23 years old so he is very busy working 10-12 hours hours a day sorry if this is just a mess i just need to talk
