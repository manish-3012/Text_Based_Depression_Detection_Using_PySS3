I dont like eating anymore It isnt that i dont have appetite i just dont like it. The idea of eating disturbs me. I dont why. Im not an overeater. Not fat too. 60 kilos 1.75 meters(something around it)
I dont want to eat my fav foods. I dont want to try new foods. I dont like pooping too. I dont like playing video games too. I dont want to study anymore. Nothing interesting in life left for me.
