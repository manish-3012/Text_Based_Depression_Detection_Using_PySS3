WHY DO THEY KEEP SENDING US TO SCHOOL?? Where I live the number of new infected people is around 10.000+ every day but our dumbass minister of education keeps sending all of us to school simply saying: "Don't worry, we're all in this together!! Xoxo". The schools could decide to leave in e-learning some classes but I'm in my last year of high school (5th year because where I live HS has 5 years) and our principal said: "We want the best education for our last year students in preparation to the State Exam so it's better if you all do in person school". I'm so fucking furious. A lot of people say things like: "You're safer in shool than outside of it, stop whining" and it's true because we all have masks and safe distance in school but as soon as we get on the public transport how can we social distance?? Where I live 95% of students use the city public transport at the same time everyday from monday to saturday and no one wants to wait hours for a empty bus just to "social distance". We are all going to get sick and get our parents/grandparents sick just because our minister of education and the presidency of national public transport refuse to actually work together. I'm so fucking tired of this situation and knowing we can't do absolutely nothing
