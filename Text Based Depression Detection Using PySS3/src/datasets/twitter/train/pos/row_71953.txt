Bullying is great I think bullying isn't as bad as people say. Too many people in Gen Z are soft. Someone getting bullied may be soft at first but there's a possibility they will build confidence and stand up for themself. The bullied person might eventually build enough confidence to defeat their bully. From there on, they won't be hurt by insults and they won't get bullied. Of course not everyone getting bullied will stop being soft but some will and that's at least a good thing.
