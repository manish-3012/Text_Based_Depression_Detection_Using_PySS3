Explode after holding it in after two very heated arguments, one at 11:30 at night, and then 9:30 am the next morning over a me being upset that my dog pissed on and ruined one of my oculus quest 2, and end up breaking a few knuckles because you accidentally punched a stud in the floor out of rage?
