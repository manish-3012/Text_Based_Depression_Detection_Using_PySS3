Drunk jealousy of youth I went to my great grandmas (mom's side of the family) Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't want to go, but I wanted to see my cousins. So I went, and everyone over 50 drinks like a fucking mad man, and when everyone was outside talking, I was on my way outside too, when my grandma's husband and my great grandma's boyfriend were drunk af arguing about the election and noticed my awkward ass walking by and one of them said "~what are you doing for school~?" All drunkenly, and I said that I quit high-school so I can work and that I'm going to get my ged next year. And he responded "wElL sInCe YoU eStAbLiShEd tHaT yOuRe sMaRtEr ThAn EvErYoNe ElSe, wHaT aRe yOu DoInG fOr CoLlEgE?" 
I wanted to punch that wrinkly cunt prickly pussy ass bitch in the face. I gave the bastard an ugly look and just said "I'm going out side, have a nice day." And I walked away lol, should I have done something else?
