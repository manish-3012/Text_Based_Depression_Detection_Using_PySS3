My dadâ€™s friend offered me money to clean his house in a bikini A) of course I said no. B) I donâ€™t even own a bikini or anything close to one so I couldnâ€™t have done it if I wanted to. 

So my dad is... to put it lightly a local drunk and everyone knows this. We are the family with no running water as of Friday night and whose power is constantly being shut off. Everyone knows this and itâ€™s hard to walk around town without hearing people talk or stare. 

Well everyone knows our financial situation or at least the bare minimum. More than i care to admit. My dad goes on week long benders with his girlfriend where they disappear and do meth for a while until they run out of money and have to come home again. He never leaves any food in the house and since we donâ€™t have water my main source of food(noodle cups) is no longer on option for me.

So here comes my dadâ€™s friend, call him Dale or something rednecky I donâ€™t care, he knocks on the door and mentions that my dadâ€™s truck has been gone for a while and he must be on one of his â€œtripsâ€. He says he knows the money situation is tight and says heâ€™s got some honest work for me if id like to provide for myself while douche bag is away. I assumed he wanted his car washed or his lawn mowed or dog walked. He wastes no time telling me he has chores he needs done but wants to make it interesting so he gets his â€œmoneyâ€™s worth.â€

He wants me to clean his house, do his dishes, laundry, stuff like that. â€œIn a bikini, to make it interesting.â€

I feel like every adult in my life knows my situation and uses it to take advantage of me. Whatâ€™s worse was I had to pretend to be polite until he left and then I locked the door and wanted to vomit. 

Of course today my dad finally comes home and I tell him what his own friend said and what do I get? â€œManâ€™s just trying to get a rise out of you.â€
Then he grabbed his clean clothes that I washed and folded for him and leaves again. 

I feel like I canâ€™t trust anyone anymore.
