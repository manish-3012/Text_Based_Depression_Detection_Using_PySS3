I have come to the conclusion that I just donâ€™t have a life, plain and simple I havenâ€™t talked to a girl my age since the start of lockdown, I donâ€™t have any friends at school, and the ones i have outside of school just donâ€™t respond to my messages. Iâ€™m completely socially inept and I live for the weekends, Iâ€™m addicted to video games and barely come out of my room. Iâ€™m 4â€™11 at 14 and always think that people are judging me, and I donâ€™t have any talents at all. Iâ€™m always stressing about my grades and canâ€™t stop procrastinating. This is a rant but Jesus I live a sad life :/ Iâ€™m just making this post to vent bc I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to other than myself.
