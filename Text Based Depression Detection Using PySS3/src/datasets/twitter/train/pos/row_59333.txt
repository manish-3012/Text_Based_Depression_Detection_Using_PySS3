Just ask someone "hey, what's up?" So the other day, I was walking home from school and a girl infront of me sat down on a bench (I later learned she was a sophomore, 1 year above me) and she started sobbing, all i did was ask this stranger "hey, whats up?" And let her vent and help her through her struggles. Just asking one simple question can save someone's life when they feel like they have nothing left. So be that for someone.
