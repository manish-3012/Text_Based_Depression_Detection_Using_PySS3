Am i doing something wrong? So me (just turned 14) and a girl (14) are chatting via our phones but since around the time school started she only messages me once, twice and sometimes doesn't send a message. Am i doing something wrong, i'm too shy to ask her and i don't want to hurt  her feelings(i don't know how, but i know i'll mess it up) is there anything i can do. We haven't spoken to eachother irl, she dm'ed me on instagram after she saw my sister's story.
