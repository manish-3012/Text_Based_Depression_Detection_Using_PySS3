I've calculated how much sleep i've lost for august. my school starts 4 hrs normally than it should due to a time table shift.

I've lost 9.083 hrs of sleep.  or, 9hrs, 4.998 mins of sleep. out of 225 hours of 8 hour sleeps every day for 30 days, psi've gotten 215 (rounded off,) hours of sleep. I've gotten throbbing headaches, eye strains, dry eyes and fatigue due to this. shifting it from 1 at noon to 9 am is so drastic some people aren't able to keep up with the work load. by the time school hours are finished, yyoyouyou have 4 more hours of work to do, so i sleep early, and i still eake up latew. they didn't notify us before the change so frick them i guess.
