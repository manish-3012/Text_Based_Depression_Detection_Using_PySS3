Help a brother out? On [chess.com](https://chess.com), me (EamonB1) and u/Steven-ODonoghue (Steven-ODonoghue) are under fire from a raging troll that can't be reasoned with. [This is the forum.](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/general-general-general-general-how-i-just-whooped-a-2400-player-in-back-to-back-games?page=1) Could anyone who has an account help us out? If you don't have an account, can you at least read through and tell us what to say in the comments? Thanks in advance, team.
