Bad teens of reddit, visit r/albertsfunhouse I just created this sub, currently I'm the only member.

Lately ive been noticing users on subs like this trying to ask questions or share experiences relating t questionable topics (drugs, sex, illegal activities, ect) and getting bombarded by stupid normies that don't know shit about what their talking about ("REEEEEEE dONt yOU knOw ThAts bAD FoR U?????? OMG gET hElP!!!"). I made this sub for teens to openly talk about their experiencing with like minded individuals.   I still have to finish setting it up an shit but check it out. (Also if anyone wants to mod that'd be sick cuz I dont have a lot of free time.

Peace and good vibesâœŒ
