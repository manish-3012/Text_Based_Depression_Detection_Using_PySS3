Why I never want to be famous, or be a celebrity. Yearning to be famous when youâ€™re a kid is normal. Hell, I was even so obsessed of being a famous youtuber back then I actually pretended to voice videos in the shower. Those were a fun few years.

Anyway as I eventually matured and became older, I kind of switched my views on things regarding popularity. One of the reasons for my change on popularity is the fact that it will put an insane amount of pressure on my mental health. Say if I was a celeb (as unlikely as it could happen), and I get social media. All those likes and constant notifications of people commenting and all that. It kinda gets to you. For people who are supportive, it just feels as if I would be pressured to do more and more of the stuff I did. Iâ€™m afraid if I continue that, I would spend all my time on whatever it is Iâ€™m known for and not on other things, like myself. 

Well what if I just donâ€™t create an account on social media? This brings me to my other point: getting recognized irl. I was never really good with conversation, nor was I good at talking in general. My fear is that I would say something that people donâ€™t like and I wouldnâ€™t even know about it. My words would have heavier weight both outside social media and in. And if I do say something that people do not like without my knowing of it, the fear of being canceled just really gets to me. 

Iâ€™d rather just live a more quiet, and private life. Most likely as a history teacher or historian and have a YouTube channel on the side as a hobby. But I donâ€™t know, maybe I am just being a bit too over-cautious or scared.
