It's that time of the night Where I talk about how good rdr2 is. Like Jesus Christ it's soo good. Great story. Great acting. Awesome graphics. It just like immerses you in the story so well. You actually feel like a an outlaw. And the story is so tragic. I ain't afraid to admit I cried more than once while playing through it.
