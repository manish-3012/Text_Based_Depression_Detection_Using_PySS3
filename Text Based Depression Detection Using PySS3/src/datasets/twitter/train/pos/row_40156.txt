Hope you have fun on your life path, Rafaela. As some of you guys here may have seen, my ex-gf posted how shes been in love with a guy for the last 2 years and how you've gotta shoot your shot. She was my girlfriend for the last 6 months. Im fucking heartbroken, now she blocked me everywhere and yeah, idk just wanted to put that out there. I'm not saying i was a perfect bf or anything but damn did that hurt.

Fafa, if you're reading this, i hope you're happy with your new boyfriend, i hope he gives you all that i couldnt, and that he treats you well. But damn am i gonna miss you singing "Flaming Hot Cheetos" to me when im sad. Don't worry, I'll be fine, but i hope you will too. I love you, okay.
