(A lol of) The people at my high school sucked (I graduated a year ago) 
oh my god.

Idk what made these kids egos so small to the point they felt compelled to make fun of kids with learning disabilities like autism because they couldnâ€™t defend themselves??

Purposely making fun of them and purposely annoying these kids and overall picking on them??? Wtf

Someone taught an autistic kid the n word so he would repeat it, and theyâ€™d purposely confuse the kids with Aspergers 

This isnâ€™t as bad as making fun of kids with disabilities but theyâ€™d just be overall passive aggressive towards the â€œweird kidsâ€ 

Obviously teachers did nothing!1!1 the assistants that were with the special needs kids would just get mad at the student for being mad and upset.
