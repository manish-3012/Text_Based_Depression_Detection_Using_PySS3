My ancestor created coca cola and he was addicted too. Coca cola was originally expectorant, but some guy tasted it when it was cold, and experienced the great mouth orgasm for the first in human history. I believe he was my ancestor. In his writings he explained 'It was something earth shattering. I could feel my tongue vibrate against my teeth that created a nice sensation, my whole throath was orgasming, my eyes felt good'. He and the creator of Pepsi together fought against each other. In one of his writings he describes a situation, where the creator of pepsi kidnapped him, tortured him with pepsi and destroyed cola bottles in front of him, causing a life long depression, which wasn't curable after what he saw. He died when he accidentally drank Fanta. The doctors said that it tasted so much like shit to him, that his heart apparently killed itself. It is theorized that he had cola inside his veins, not blood. I believe this is the case for me too
