Someone, literally anyone please tell me why. Why in the world do only current students attend the homecoming dance when homecoming is to welcome back previous alumni? I canâ€™t wrap my head around this. I checked Wikipedia, nothing. Like, if the main event is a sports game then we do have everybody attend but not if itâ€™s a dance. This makes no sense to me and I canâ€™t find anything on it (Okay, more accurately Iâ€™m too lazy to look any further.) I just donâ€™t get why do we even call it homecoming then when itâ€™s most often a dance WHERE NOBODY COMES HOME? I know homecoming isnâ€™t even happening this year but someone mentioned that it wasnâ€™t happening to me recently and it made them sad and I thought â€œForget your depression and loneliness, thereâ€™s no information on this question anywhere!â€ So I will not be satisfied until I know the answer.
