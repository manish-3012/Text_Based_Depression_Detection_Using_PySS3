Can't think of a title to explain this post So I created this story of the top of my head. I need 10-20 people to play the story. We all start of on this random planet though most of us will die by the end. 
Ik it sounds weird but the story is intresting and its a game of loyalty and betrayal you can form alliances etc with other people. You have to make alliances like the hunger games and work together to eliminate people. You will understand and most likely enjoy it once if start i just aent an expert at explaining things
