Is 8hrs a day on a computer considered addiction? My mom always gets so mad about this, apparently my eyes are like completely red but when I look in the mirror the worst that happens is that my corners of my eyes are a little red. She says that there is a difference between being on a PC and on a TV, and she also believes that video games cause violence and that I'm going crazy from playing video games.
I just want another opinion on this so I know who is in the right, as I've heard a lot that 8hrs a day is actually pretty normal for gamers.
