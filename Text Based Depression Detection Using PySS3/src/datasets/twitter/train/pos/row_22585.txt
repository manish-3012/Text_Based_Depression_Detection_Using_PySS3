Hey I need help So the other day I had to talk to a therapist then I had to stay a night at this place I think its called casualties prevention clinic once i got out i texted sorry to my friends then everyone knew that i was high risk for suicide and the girl who bullied me last year is saying she never ment to make me feel bad and never wanted to hurt me she onr of her freinds told me " she doesn't have the strength to talk to me becauseshe feels bad" and she was crying to whole time so now idk if I should give her a second chance or just leave her be sad because she put me through so much pain, sadness, and anger what should I do?
