holy fuck this feeling questioning existence, wondering what it all means. does this feeling have a name? i like this seems like a constant feeling i want to be in. there is absolutely no way to prove that everything is in my head. no way to prove my colors are the same as yours. no way to prove that your entire memory and this universe just popped into existence two days ago.
