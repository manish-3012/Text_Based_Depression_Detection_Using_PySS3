Do you guys have a Girlfriend / Boyfriend? What's it like? Just askin. I will most likely die Single. I have weird music tastes, i don't watch anime, and other stuff which no one will have something common with me.   


I don't wanna grow old alone so i think i should find some way to you know.......  


So yeah the question is in the title.
