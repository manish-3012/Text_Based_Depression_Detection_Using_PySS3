I physically cannot fathom the idea that people take Roblox seriously I was messing about on Roblox with my friends just trolling people on an SCP game I think, we were probably never going to play it again but anyways.

An admin happened to be in the server and noticed what we were doing. He really said that we were 'violating the roblox guidelines' like dude we were having fun this is a KIDS GAME but ok.I refuse to believe that people take Roblox this seriously and treat it like an actual real life job.
