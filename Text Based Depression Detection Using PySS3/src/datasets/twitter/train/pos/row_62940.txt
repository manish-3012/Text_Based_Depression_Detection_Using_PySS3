Are you surprised with the way the election turned out? Why or why not? There for a bit I thought Trump would win, I do support him for the most part but Iâ€™m ready to see what Biden can do for our country. No hate to either party. Super surprised to see how many people actually voted Kanye, he was on the ballots here in KY.
