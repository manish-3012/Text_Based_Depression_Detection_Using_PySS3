My crush rejected me and I donâ€™t know what to do So my crush is in my class and so I decide to try to form some kind of friendship for now. And today we are still good friends. She was doing stuff that I thought was sending signs but she wasnâ€™t actually doing it, so I decided to send a little bits of one back. I got her number 2 days ago and today she asked my if I had a crush on her. And I tell her yes. I ask if she has a crush on me and she says no and she has a boyfriend. So I am trying to just get over it and not expose myself to our friend group. So anyone with past experience know what to do?
