Panic At The Disco's Occult Illuminated Lyrics https://youtu.be/V0wkyvDIxfA

Hey Guys, this video covers the hidden meanings of the song, "That Green Gentleman" by Panic! At The Disco.

It's a song about healing from the ego identity, nirvana, and the one mind that projects the universe. The Green Gentleman represents the part of our mind that recognizes truth from illusion and is responsible for waking us up from the dream when we are ready to hear it.

With lyrics such as, "I'm someone I've never met" "I wanna go where everyone feels the same" and "I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her, now I'm the only one to blame" the Non-Dualistic symbolism of the lyrics becomes clear.

We are someone we've never met with our ego identities. We are the one mind that believes it's separate from source, and more truthfully, the one mind that's NOT separate from source. Nirvana, Heaven, or Source is where everyone is and feels the same. It's our true home. We never admitted we missed this home, where everyone and everything still is, and instead perpetuated the ego thought system to create scapegoats for our perceived guilt over our belief we separated. The ego survives by blaming others for this inner guilt that we displace out of our awareness, but the onus is on us to finally take that responsibility for our own feelings. 

Thank you guys for reading/watching, and I'm here for any questions or discussion you might have.
