"Are Traps Gay?" Solved. Based on what i have seen as comment and remarks on this incredibly complex and difficult probelm i have devised a solution out of a stroke of pure genious.

I present you "SchrÃ¶dingers Gayness" which determens that if one is completely unaware if said imagery is infact gay or not in ground truth then the observeing individual are not gay.

But in the case the ground truth had been observerd in advance and is conciously accounted for said individual (under assumption the ground truth was that the trap indeed was a trap) is now gay.

TL:DR Traps are only gay if it is conciously known they are a trap, traps of which the ground truth is not known are not.
