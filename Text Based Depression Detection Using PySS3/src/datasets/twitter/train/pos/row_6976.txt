Can girls stop throwing around the word â€œmisogynistâ€ and â€œincelâ€ like a basketball when someone says something bad about a woman Like itâ€™s getting annoying, all these girls(I know itâ€™s not all girls) are saying â€œkill all menâ€ and are pushing for us to just not exist in society but as soon as we say something that they donâ€™t like about girls or a group of girls, weâ€™re assholes , incels, like why is nobodytalking about the women that literally want every man to kill them selves and calling them out?And there is actually people that think the world would be a much better place of all men just killed themselves.

Big double standard
