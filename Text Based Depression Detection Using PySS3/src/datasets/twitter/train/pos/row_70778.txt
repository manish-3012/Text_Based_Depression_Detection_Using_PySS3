Confirmed case of Corona at my school So, today, while we were in drama class, a load of school staff come out the door (our class was near the entrance to our bubble) in high-viz jackets. Everyone was looking out the window and whispering. Some of the guesses were a car crash, a bad injury, or Covid.

A few minutes later, our teacher announces that a student in our year has Covid, and we are all going home. We have to remotely learn again. At about 2:45pm GMT I get picked up. Its 10:30pm GMT right now. I will try and keep this post updated either via the comments or the post itself, for the 4 people that see this and the 1 that cares.
