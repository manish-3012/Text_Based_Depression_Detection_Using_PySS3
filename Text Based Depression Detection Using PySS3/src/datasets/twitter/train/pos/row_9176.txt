Any of you cunts play R6 siege on Xbox (uk) I absolutely hate playing with randoms with no mics and I really wanna get back into the game (havenâ€™t played in about a year)

Would just be playing casual and I ainâ€™t too bothered about winning. 

Also Iâ€™d prefer people around the same age as me but I ainâ€™t too bothered if your younger/older as long as youâ€™re not annoying/a dickhead

Ps can one of yâ€™all tell me if my account is marked NSFW? Idk why it is and every time I change it it changes back

Edit: just to clarify for anyone reading this,
Iâ€™ve never played ranked nor do I have any intention of doing so
