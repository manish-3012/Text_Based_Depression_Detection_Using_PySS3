My nephew keeps purposely messing with my cat. I have the right to be annoyed right? Hes about 12-13. My cat gets stressed out really easily and you can tell if she doesnt want to be bothered. Sheâ€™ll keep meowing at you but its more of a â€œleave me the fuck alone before i scratch youâ€ meow. My nephew tho loves to ignore that and just keep bothering her. And im pretty sure he knows it annoys me, like leave her alone. Sometimes i hear her boarder line hissing and crying cuz he keeps messing with her.

Just now she was sleeping so he came up here in my room, grabbed her and just took her downstairs. I want to say something but i know if i show him that it bothers me heâ€™ll do it more. And i would talk to my mom but it seems like im the only person here with respect for my animals. Ugh
