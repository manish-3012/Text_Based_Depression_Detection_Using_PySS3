My connection is TRASH It started 2 days ago when my connection went horrible, I have online classes and I can't understand what the teacher says, I also can't play.
I tried turning off my device and turning it on again, nothing happens.
I am using a mobile connection, if you can help please comment/DM me for what to do.

I am in an online class so it might take a while for me to respond
