idk about yâ€™all but lgbt movies and games arenâ€™t a thing because theyâ€™re not appealing to the majority of the audience. look Iâ€™m sorry, but a movie on a gay relationship isnâ€™t something Iâ€™m gonna watch like â€œawwâ€, some people might but a lot wonâ€™t and thatâ€™s just how it is.

it isnâ€™t normal. stop telling people it is. itâ€™s ok to be lgbt but by no means is it normal. this normalizing is why every 13-16 year old girl now is â€œbiâ€. it isnâ€™t something to look â€œcoolâ€, it isnâ€™t a trend, it isnâ€™t normal. Iâ€™m not hating but this is facts. 

Am I wrong in thinking this?
