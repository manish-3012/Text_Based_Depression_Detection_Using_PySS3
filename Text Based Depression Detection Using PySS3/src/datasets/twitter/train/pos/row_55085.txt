Is it wrong for me (M 17) to be dating a 20 girl? Recently I have met a girl who is 3 years older than me. Her and I have been hitting it off big time and are thinking of dating. However, some friends of mine think this is problematic. They say that it is pedophilic for this girl to be in a relationship with me. I just need reasoning to help me explain to them that this is fine. [No this is not bait, yes we do have feelings for one another]
