What is my life rn So first off, my house is constantly full of yelling and arguing and nothing is going to change that, so I have adapted to doing anything important after everyone goes to sleep.  This is normally fine because I get my stuff done and go to bed before it gets to late for me to get a full-ish rest, however when I got on my laptop tonight to do some homework I found all of my applications blocked, and when I went to my mom to ask her why she started accusing me of manipulating her and my dad into letting me do stuff like that, so she took it all away.  Now my dad is pissed calling me a useless child, threatening to kick me out, and over all just being hateful, I mean he literally just kicked my dog across the room because she was in his way, my mom on the other hand is saying stuff like Iâ€™m being manipulative and saying my depression is my fault because I am the one that makes them act like they do and that itâ€™s really just me blowing things out of preparation cuz I can.  I donâ€™t know what to do, my dad is going on rants about how heâ€™s taking all electronics out of the house because they are the source of all my problems and have ruined my life, while my mom is making up a bunch of stuff that I didnâ€™t say and yelling about how sheâ€™s not letting someone help us with these problem because all Iâ€™m trying to do is get them to waste money.  I need help please, what do I do?  Iâ€™m balling my eyes out rn, so Iâ€™m sorry if thereâ€™s a bunch of writing mistakes.
