What's the difference between a friend and a partner? Obviously I know: Kissing, raising a family, all that. But besides that having a friend and having a partner doesn't seem too different to me. 

A friend supports you, loves you, trusts you, you can tell them anything and they can tell you anything. 

A partner supports you, loves you, trusts you, you can tell them anything and they can tell you anything. 

They seem so much alike.

Its probably just me though, I put immense trust in all my friends, even if I've just known them for a month or so. Maybe that's bad, Idk I've never been good socially
