My telltale heart's a hammer in my chest. Cut my like silk-tied tourniquet. THIS.

IS.

MY.

# ROARING, ROARING 20's. I DON'T, EVEN KNOW ME!

# ROLL ME BLUNT CAUSE I WANNA GO HOME.

# ROLL ME A ROLL ME A BLUNT

***This is my roaring, roaring 20s! I don't even know me. Roll me a blunt cause I wanna go home, roll me a roll me a blunt cause I wanna go home!***
