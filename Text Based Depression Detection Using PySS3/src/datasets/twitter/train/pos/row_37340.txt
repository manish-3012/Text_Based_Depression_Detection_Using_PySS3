My mom also said I canâ€™t take the COVID vaccine For background I saw a post saying their parents arenâ€™t letting them get the vaccine and mine wonâ€™t either. 
I do understand their reasoning though. Most vaccines take years to test and be put into use. I do want to get it as soon as possible but I do understand how some parents could be worried. My parents arenâ€™t anti-vaxxers, in fact they are the opposite but they want the vaccine to be tested more before their children have it.
