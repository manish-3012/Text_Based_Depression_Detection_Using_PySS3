Just a Rant Keep scrolling Just getting my thoughts off my chest

Past 2 years of my life have been psh awful What the fuck were those years, I lost all my friends, I ran from my own burning home , I got depressed for over a year, I literally lost all positive emotions, I bottled up everything and just collapsed mentally , wtf did i do to deserve this????

Some of those problems have been fixed my house is ok, Iâ€™m not depressed or traumatised anymore and Iâ€™m more positive obv not rn , maybe I should write some sort of timeline of my life out and think about how to fix it

Imma regret this post and delete it soon 100%
