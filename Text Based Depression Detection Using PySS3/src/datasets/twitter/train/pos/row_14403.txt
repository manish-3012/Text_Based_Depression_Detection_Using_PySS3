Is it normal for a 14 year old to have a body count of 252? i swear im not bragging. am i a "man hoe" if i have slept with this many girls? theres nothing wrong with wanting to be laid and not have a relationship? i was listening to his podcast and bryce hall said he has slept with 40 woman, which he later admitted was an exaggeration. everybody thought that that was a huge number lol.
