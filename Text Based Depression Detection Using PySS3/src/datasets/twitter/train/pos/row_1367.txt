If you're bored and are looking for a light read, check out this book I wrote when I was younger! Hi everyone! When I was younger (think preteen age), one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life. Recently, I've been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason. It's definitely not worthy of publishing, but I am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist (10-12). Some things I wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after I wrote it, which makes me curious how it would be received by others.

Here is a synopsis of my book: *Ten-year-old Margaret Lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways. She's learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult, which naturally involves many changes. The story opens as Meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named Wayne. Join Meg's ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships. You'll meet nice and mean girls during the journey, but beware - most girls around this age can be both! And, of course, as the title would suggest, Meg develops a crush on a boy named Max who is actually fourteen years old. How will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence Meg and the world around her?* [Read Max and I to find out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9QXF08iQtf31iGRPq29mFz51ccMdfbJWib7sXf0Tko/edit?usp=sharing)*.*
