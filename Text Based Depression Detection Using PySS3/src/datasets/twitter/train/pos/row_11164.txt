Can non-binary people be gay? I know it sounds stupid, but here me out. They don't identify as male or female, meaning that if they DO date a male or female, they wouldn't be considered to be gay or straight because that would just contradict their identities as a whole...right? This is a genuine question, no shade, no hate, just curiosity.
