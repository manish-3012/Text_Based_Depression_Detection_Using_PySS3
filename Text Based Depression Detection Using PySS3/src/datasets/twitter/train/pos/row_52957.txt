My thoughts on PUG Pugs are good bois all animals are but I just found out that the fact that they are missing a snot is a genetic deformities that has been bred into it and thatâ€™s not normal. We keep them as a pet and for cute reasons we can fuck them up. 

Furthermore they look like a dog hit in the face with a pan. And because their skull is like a tuna can shaped fuck, they canâ€™t breathe properly their entire life. 

Ever been around a pug? Constantly matter the weather or temperature itâ€™s going â€˜grah grahâ€™. Of a human child came out with a circle face, no nose, and neckless going â€˜grah grahâ€™ the mom would put the child back into the uterus. 

Ps: I donâ€™t mean any disrespect, I just think that our best friends should also be allowed to breathe properly
