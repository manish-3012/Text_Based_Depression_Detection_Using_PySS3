Stupid Shit that happened to me ever (Stand Up comedy) So, have y'all ever seen that Sprite Cranberry commercial? So, basically I'd be sweating my ass off, sitting on my couch, waiting for Mr. Sprite Charming, I have nothing against it, but sometimes how Sprite can convince their editors on some of their most stupid ads to animate this guy who can basically shape shift his face.

 On to the Kool-Aid man commercial, he would break into your house for drinking soda, so he is the cholesterol police now which is I'm now thinking. This was 7 years ago when I was 6, I had a rational fear of him, thinking he would break into my house, and force me to drink his kool-aid guts. So I still live with my grandparents, and when they found out I had a fear of him, they used to put, "I am watching you" on every soda bottle my uncle bought for himself. So when I read that, I'd chuck the bottle into the trash can, thinking I'm smart, meanwhile my grandparents be sitting there, reading a fucking news article about how Republicans are defunding burger joints.

 What are the Republicans thinking, so my local burger joint has to much of greasy burgers, that it will cause me to get a triple chin? I am also a republican, but sometimes what the hell goes in their minds? I mean it's nice for them to think about the children's health, but damn cheeseburgers, "The greasy food of death" what I saw when I was 6.

 The last thing I wanna explain is, all those damn Doritos commercials. There was this one where there was a fucking nude woman in bed, winking at a man. Just stop, it took my memory foam mattress 9 months to forget my ex, now its gonna take a whole year just to get those damn stains off, how about stop trying to be hip like the new generation, and just focus on damn sales, and stop trying to impress wanna be cool 8yr olds.
