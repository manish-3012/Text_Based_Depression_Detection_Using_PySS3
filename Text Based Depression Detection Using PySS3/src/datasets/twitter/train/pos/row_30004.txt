Should I tell my best friend that I love her? I have been in love with my best friend after a year weâ€™ve known, but it has been the last months it has been really hard to hide it or neglect it.
Just to take some energy out of my body I decided to write a [letter](https://i.imgur.com/3rLDDCH.jpg) (if you want to see the original, the translation is down there), but this have put the question (title) on my mind so should I do it?

Translation:

Since Iâ€™ve know you my life gave a 180Â° turn, I think if you didnâ€™t talk to me that day our friendship wouldnâ€™t exist yo have helped me and I have helped you in difficult times, you have been one of the persons that have taken the time to know me (or at least have tried).

While our friendship was growing like flowers, another flower was starting to grow on me, something more special that I have been trying to keep in secret during a long time, everyday is starting to get harder and harder to hide it or deny it, everyday i canâ€™t stop thinking about a future at your side or how my life could be with out you.

I know that Iâ€™m not probably the man of your dreams or the most suitable for you, but people changes Â¿no? I know that I can change just for you and to have that future that I canâ€™t take out of my head.

I know that you only see me as the person of confidence buuut... Would you be my girlfriend?

It is not the exact letter but I tried to make the most exact translation that I could do, sorry for formatting Iâ€™m on mobile and my English.

Thanks for reading
