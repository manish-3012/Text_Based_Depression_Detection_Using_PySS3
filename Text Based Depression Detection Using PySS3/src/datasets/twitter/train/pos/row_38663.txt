Advice for my teenage daughter Hello everyone, my name is dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.  I have a daughter, Vanessa, whom I love dearly and I try my best to give her a better life than I had (I was raised by Wolves, forced to be gnome, went to school with girls clothes, and my parents didn't show up to my own birth, that should give you an idea) but she's always gloomy and angry/sad with me. My wife and I are divorced and I think she likes her more. I was wondering if any of you have advice for me on what to do to make her happier?
