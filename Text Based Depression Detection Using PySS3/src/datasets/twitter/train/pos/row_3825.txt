Anyone who would talk with me? My life's falling apart and I have no one... In the last minutes something very serious happened in my life that basically pretty much changed my future...

My mom got into an argument with my stepdad (again) but this time things got hot. My mom wants to move out with me and my stepbrother would stay with my stepdad. Well, I'm Polish but I live in Switzerland and also study here (highschool). She doesn't earn too much money, and I'm worried how will we make it. There is no way she would pay for my university all alone, and I wanted to get a master degree, since I'm good at school. My real dad in Poland also doesn't make much many. I'm also worried about her,  it's the second time someone hurt her. 

What can I do? I thought of working and saving up money to pay the scholarship in the future. I just feel I can't do anything. Everything was good like one hour ago but it suddenly changed. 

They're still arguing and yelling at each other while I'm writing this.

Please, what should I do

I tried to reach out to my friends but no one responds.
