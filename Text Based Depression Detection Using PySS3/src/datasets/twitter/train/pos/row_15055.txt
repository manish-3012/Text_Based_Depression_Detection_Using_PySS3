ignore me ranting lol i genuinely think there is something wrong with me, you know? i focus so much on my dreams and i do risky shit and i just need someone to actually take me seriously before i go too far with shit. every time i bring up the possibility of getting reassessed with my parents they say â€œitâ€™s no use, youâ€™ve adapted your coping and environment to match so itâ€™s not worth the moneyâ€ but iâ€™m *not coping* i canâ€™t sleep and i feel like shit all the time and iâ€™m scared to go to sleep because i know iâ€™ll obsess over it again. i dont fucking know anymore.
