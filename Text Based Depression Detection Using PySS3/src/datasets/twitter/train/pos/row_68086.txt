I Lost My Best Friend and Many Others to Avatar - Looking For Desperate Help I'm a 16-year-old male who has a very close best friend and a somewhat large friend circle. Recently though in the past couple of months, an evil force has taken hold of one of my friends. Now I know what your thinking... was it drugs, alcohol, a toxic relationship? No, it is the 2005 children's cartoon Avatar. First, his love started out peaceful. He would only watch the show and talk about it every now and then. But then almost like an evil virus, a sense in him took over where he needed to spread his love and appreciation for the show in order to not die out. Then he started having group watch sessions with people in our friend group on discord. Back in those times, it was just once during the day that he and his friends would watch the show. But I know that phase would only last so little before a more extremists lust for the show developed. Currently, now he has convinced several individuals to watch and become obsessed with the show. I barely have enough time to talk or interact with him as he is always watching the show and talking with people in private calls about it. Obviously, I don't hate the show but People of Reddit I request your help on how I can get my friend back before it is too late. Help me, please...
