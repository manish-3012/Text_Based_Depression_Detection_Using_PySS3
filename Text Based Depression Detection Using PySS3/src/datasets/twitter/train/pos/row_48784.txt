i feel so lonely...damn... i need a new friend i donâ€™t even know what to say...

actually thereâ€™s a lot but i canâ€™t find the effort to say any of it

nor can i find anyone whoâ€™s interested... actually thatâ€™s a lie

i have like a couple very good friends whoâ€™d want to know but... idk... i pride myself on my independence &amp; that includes my emotional independence i guess... makes me cold...

wondering: does being passionate about stuff make life more interesting or heartbreaking... idk

i just need someone to talk to... just a friend... i donâ€™t think i wanna really vent... just distract myself 

iâ€™m 18 &amp; from uk btw
