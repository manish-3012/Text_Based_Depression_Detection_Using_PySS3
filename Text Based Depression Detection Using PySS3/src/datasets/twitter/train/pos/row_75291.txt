My level of confusion is through the roof now... I just took 2 different tests about what political party I am, and I got some very... interesting results. One came back saying I was an Opportunity Democrat, basically meaning that I have liberal views on things like the environment, the LGBTQ+ community, and immigration. However, we vary from your standard "Solid Liberal" (that's what the site calls it) in the sense that we believe that with hard work, anything can happen, and we tend to fail to see the barriers people of other races and genders face.

HOWEVER, I also took another test, and it came back saying I'm Republican, so now I'm sitting here like, *Maybe I am as moderate as I thought I was,* because I thought I was moderate but then during a debate my conservative parents said that I'm more liberal. This threw me into a bit of a mental mess, and now here I am, even more confused about politics than I was before...

What do you all think?
