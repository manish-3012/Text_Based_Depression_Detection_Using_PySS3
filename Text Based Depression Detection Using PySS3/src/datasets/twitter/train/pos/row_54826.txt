Schools rough We all know this very clearly. 

Iâ€™m in 11th grade and homeschooled. I am just so overwhelmed by the amount of work and stress that itâ€™s putting me under. I feel that at any moment I might just collapse. 

Iâ€™m so close to finishing school and that might be part of why Iâ€™m stressing so much, cuz what do I do afterwards?Where do I go? All of my other friends know what they wanna do once theyâ€™re done with school. And honestly I feel like a punk whenever we talk. 

Honestly, I have been a straight A student form the time I started school and when I started 10th grade, everything just went to hell. This year is really important and Iâ€™ve just been feeling so unmotivated to do anything much really. 

I guess what Iâ€™m asking is, and Iâ€™m sorry for the long story, I need help or advice at least, just so that I can feel good about myself and what Iâ€™ve done. Itâ€™s honestly been a while. So if you all can help, I really do appreciate it a lot! Thanks.
