what even is the point nobody is ever going to take me seriously because iâ€™m nonbinary and everyone constantly uses the wrong fucking pronouns and name behind my back all the time and i can literally tell people my name or pronouns and they still donâ€™t use them. i donâ€™t â€œpassâ€ as nonbinary. iâ€™m fucking tired of it. i just want people to give me the basic amount of respect. all i ask is they use my name and pronouns. thatâ€™s it. itâ€™s not fucking difficult. itâ€™s so fucking tiring. itâ€™s not hard to just respect someone.
