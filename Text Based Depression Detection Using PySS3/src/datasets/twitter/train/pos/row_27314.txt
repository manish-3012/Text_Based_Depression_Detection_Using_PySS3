I feel bad for doing this So I went to a Trump rally today (I donâ€™t mean for this to be political). We had vip tickets or something so there were reserved seats near the front for us. But to get there we had to go through the crowd, and thatâ€™s why I feel bad, for walking past all the other people who were trying to get as close as possible and we just get front row seats just like that.
