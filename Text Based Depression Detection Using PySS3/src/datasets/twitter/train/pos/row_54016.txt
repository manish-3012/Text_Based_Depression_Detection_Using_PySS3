Can we talk about instagram meme pages for a sec? There are some good memes that come out of ig meme pages but those pages are breeding grounds for ignorant assholes.

There was a post of a trans women with a T-Shirt that said "Transgender Veteran: I fought for your right to hate me". She had top surgery done, it was obvious that she had gone through hormone therapy, and she passed fairly well.

There were people in the comments correcting people who called her "her", saying shit like "more like he fought for his right to change gender". Someone asked if there was a difference between hating trans people and hating one specific person who happens to be trans.

There were a few people that said they supported her (the veteran) and "I dont see the problem", but those people are hard to come by on those types of pages. I only followed because I wanted to see the memes my friends were sharing and I got this shit instead. 

Also, the admins who run this particular meme page would post this shit to get reactions like that. I guess transphobia is amusing to them??? Im just kind of frustrated at this point.

I might go digging for more examples but,

Thoughts?
