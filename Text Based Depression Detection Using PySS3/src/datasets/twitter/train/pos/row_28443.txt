My mom threw my phone out into the back yard because I was struggling hard with online learning Even though *I* paid for it with my *own money* she still took it from my hand, opened the back sliding door, and threw it out into the yard, landing in the grass.  I Told her that it was my only way of communication to my friends, she still thought it was a good idea and it would help my grade. Yeah. Waterlogged phone in my hands rn. Ill have to pay damages.
