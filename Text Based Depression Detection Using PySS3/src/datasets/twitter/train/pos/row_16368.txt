Why calling students out in the class is a terrible idea If you're a teacher, calling students in the class to solve a sum in the class or forcing them to give an answer to something is a terrible idea because we're already so fucking anxious that we're going to say or do something embarrassing in front of our friends and face mockery, that calling the person out to say something they may not know in front of the entire class to feed your egoistic need for superiority is just plain selfish.
