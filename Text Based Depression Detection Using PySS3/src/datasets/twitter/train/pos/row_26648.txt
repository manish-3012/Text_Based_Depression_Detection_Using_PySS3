A teacher I despise lost his mother So I had this teacher a couple years ago and he is SO mean. He was a big jerk. Every boy hated him, because he was also a big simp and favored girls. But I just got an email that his mother passed away and I'm not really sure how to feel. I'm not thinking "he deserved it" or anything but I feel bad for him because that must be really hard to deal with. I really am not sure how to take this.
