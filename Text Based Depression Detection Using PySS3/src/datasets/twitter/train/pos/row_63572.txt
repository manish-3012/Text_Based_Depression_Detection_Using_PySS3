yâ€™all how do I fix this, is this salvageable One of my best friends (who also happens to be bi) and I were talking a few days ago and I was mumbling something about my new celebrity crush and she misheard it as my saying I was into her. I was like... what? no, thatâ€™s weird hahaha what ;-; so my friend was all reassured, and agreed with me that it would be weird if I liked her, so I brushed the whole thing off. 

But what the heck, now all our messages to each other are so choppy. feels bad how do I fix this
