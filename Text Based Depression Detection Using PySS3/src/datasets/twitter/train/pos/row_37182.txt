Dude I just messed up so bad Itâ€™s 3:30 in the morning for me right now. Iâ€™ve been up doing a little bit of schoolwork and got sidetracked like usual. This time though I was looking at Reddit and my mom opened my door and asked what I was doing. 
I looked at her and said â€œIâ€™m just... looking up somethingâ€ and I didnâ€™t register what I just said until she left the room.
Pray for me
