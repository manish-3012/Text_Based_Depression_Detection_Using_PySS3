Whatâ€™s your sense of identity? Not to get too deep with this one, but really donâ€™t feel like I have any identity or sense of self, an issue I really want to change. Most of this just because I live out of a duffle bag, shuffled between my divorced parentsâ€™ houses, so I guess no real family or culture was ever there for me?

Iâ€™ve tried to build some kind of identity out of my interests like music and coding but it really doesnâ€™t do the trick for me.

Anyone who feels theyâ€™ve really succeeded in this regard, howâ€™d you go about crafting your sense of self?
