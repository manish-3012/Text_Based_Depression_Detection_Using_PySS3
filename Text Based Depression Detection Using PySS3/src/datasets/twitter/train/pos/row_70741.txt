I suffered from a mental breakdown last night. It has horrible. I felt like the world was going to end if I fell asleep and I would never see the sun rise ever again. I felt so alone and hopeless. I had to go to my parentâ€™s bedroom and tell them that I was scared. I wanted to cry but I couldnâ€™t for some reason. I donâ€™t want to die yet.
