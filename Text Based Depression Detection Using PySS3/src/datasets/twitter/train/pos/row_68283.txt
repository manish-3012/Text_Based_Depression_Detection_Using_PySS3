my brother just came in and told me that the one of my highlighters smelled exactly like me I was so confused and just went like 'so is it good or bad?' and he was like 'good', smiled, and then walked out with one of my Sharpies.

he's 7 btw. I don't know if I should feel complimented or insulted.

k that is all lol bye  :)
