Theorem (Rank-Nullity Theorem): Given finite dimensional vector spaces V, W, and a linear map f: V -&gt; W, dim ker f + rank f = dim V.

Proof: Let {v\_1, . . ., v\_k} be a basis for ker f. We extend this to a basis {v\_1, . . ., v\_n} for V. We now note that since f is linear, {f(v\_1), . . ., f(v\_n)}spans f(V). However, f(v\_1) = f(v\_2) = . . . = f(v\_k) = 0. Thus 

{f(v\_{k+1}), . . ., f(v\_n)} spans f(V). We now show that {f(v\_{k + 1}), . . ., f(v\_n)} is a basis of f(V). Since it already spans, it is enough to show that it is linearly independent.

Suppose not. Then there exist a\_{k + 1}, . . ., a\_n, not all 0, such that a\_{k + 1} f(v\_{k + 1}) + . . . + a\_n f(v\_n) = 0. Thus since f is linear, f(a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n) = 0, and hence 

a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n is an element of ker f.

Thus since {v\_1, . . ., v\_k} is a basis for ker f, there exist a\_1, . . ., a\_k such that 

a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} + . . . + a\_n v\_n = a\_1 v\_1 + . . . + a\_k v\_k

or, alternatively,

a\_1 v\_1 + . . . a\_k v\_k - a\_{k + 1} v\_{k + 1} - . . . - a\_n v\_n = 0.

As we have assumed that not all of the a\_i are 0, this shows that {v\_1, . . ., v\_n} is not linearly independent, hence not a basis. Contradiction. 

Thus we must have  {f(v\_{k + 1}), . . ., f(v\_n)}, and hence a basis. Thus 

rank f = dim f(V) = n - k = dim V - dim ker f,

and hence

rank f + dim ker f = dim V.

QED.

This proof beautifully illustrates the power of well-chosen definitions. By defining basis, linear maps, and dimension properly, we get a very useful result that is at the heart of much of linear algebra. It also showcases the powerful (though sometimes misleading) technique of *proof by contradiction*, wherein one shows something is false by assuming it is true and deriving a contradiction.

This proof is not a hard proof, I rederived today it after not looking at it for three years. It is, however, somewhat long and involves many steps and ideas from basic linear algebra.

This is also not the only proof of this theorem. There are others, one of which uses quotient vector spaces and is almost identical to the proof showcased in #2, with a few details changed. But I wanted to show you guys something new, that showcases other powerful ideas.
