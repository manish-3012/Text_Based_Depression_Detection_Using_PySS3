How to not be weird when meeting up with a girl? So I asked my crush if she could help me in Math because we are in the same math class and she said yes. Actually I'm quite well in the current topic and it was an excuse to talk to her and maybe spent time with her. Of course we will mostly do math together but how can I make this meeting not weird and how can I speak of topic (not about math) without being weird and make the situation uncomfortable?
