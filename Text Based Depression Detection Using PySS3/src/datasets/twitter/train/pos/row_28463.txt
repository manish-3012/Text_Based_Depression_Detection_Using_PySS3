I think I'm being friendzoned by my own personality I feel like I give off little brother vibes. Like whenever I'm around people that MIGHT want to date me. I just end up acting like a little kid! Why I will never have a girlfriend. I'll have many female friends but I doubt I willl ever have a girlfriend. I've gone beyond friend zone and Into brother zone. By MYSELF. Like I get that I'm shirt but you don't have to be so obvious about it.
