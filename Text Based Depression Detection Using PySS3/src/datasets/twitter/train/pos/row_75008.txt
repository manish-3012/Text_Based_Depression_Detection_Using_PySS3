GUYS I HAVE A THEORY So you know how they say â€œredditors canâ€™t get a girlfriendâ€? And you know how a lot of redditors are weebs? 

Well my theory is that it is not redditors that canâ€™t get girlfriends, but weebs. 

So stop watching that weeb shit and start watching some movies with real actors. 

How did I come up with this theory, you may ask?

Well long story short I was talking with some weebs and they said weebs canâ€™t get girlfriends. 

And I can somewhat verify this, or at least falsify the â€œredditors canâ€™t get girlfriendsâ€ bullshit, cause I have a girlfriend.
