If a teacher ever tells you and/or your friends to stop messing around, stop messing around. I accidentally cracked the neck of my only real friend in Darwin. I feel like actual shit and itâ€™s bringing back a few bad thoughts. Donâ€™t kill your friend AND yourself at the same time. Double kills a shit moves.
