I GOT ACCEPTED!!! Yâ€™all I got accepted to be a delegate of my state in the Congress of Future Medical Leaders! Iâ€™ll get to meet people who have won noble prizes, Iâ€™ll get to watch a surgery IN PERSON, and I get to see some of the highest technological advancements in modern day medicine up close! Iâ€™m so happy!
