Do people experience the high school hierarchies seen in movies? I'm in a small-ish town, where our high school has less than 1000 students. I was watching a movie about high school and the typical high school hierarchy was in it, though I've noticed there really isn't much of one at my school. The biggest hierarchy type thing would probably just be different classes thinking better than others. Basically I was wondering if other people experience the general hierarchy thing seen in movies.
