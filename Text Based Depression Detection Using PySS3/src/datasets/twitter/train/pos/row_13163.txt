Oh boy, I sure hate being short....... I recently turned 15, and out of all my friends, Iâ€™m the oldest. But! Iâ€™m only like 1.58-59 almost 60 m, while my friends are at 1.65m+. Itâ€™s been like this for ages now and Iâ€™m very self conscious about it. Being the oldest, itâ€™s the worst. Anyone else agrees?
