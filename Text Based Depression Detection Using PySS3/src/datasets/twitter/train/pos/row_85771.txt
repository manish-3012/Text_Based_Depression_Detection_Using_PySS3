I donâ€™t see the point in talking to my friends anymore I feel guilty every single day about how I havenâ€™t called my friends or texted them. I think a part of me just really wants to be around them, I donâ€™t know. I mean I donâ€™t know why. I tried calling my friend and obviously I couldnâ€™t even talk properly bc all I was thinking about was how dumb I sounded. Anyone who knows me will just end up hating me just like everyone else. I somehow always manage to mess up things, might as well not even try and just get left out again. Iâ€™d rather be alone and lonely than be rejected again and I guess itâ€™s a situation that Iâ€™ll never win in. I had friends that really liked me a few years ago but weâ€™re not really in touch any more and I managed to screw that up too so yeah! Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at right now
