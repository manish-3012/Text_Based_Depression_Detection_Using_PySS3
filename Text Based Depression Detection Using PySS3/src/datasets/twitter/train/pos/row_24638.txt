I could die lol I got this "staph" (i think that's how it's spelled) infection in my finger and it like mutated into a antibiotic resistant version and i COULD die if the bacteria decides to take a field trip into my heart or lungs and i can't stop it from doing that soo...i guess i just wait and see.
