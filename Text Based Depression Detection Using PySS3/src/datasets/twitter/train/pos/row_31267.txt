Wanted to help a Youtuber i watch. Heâ€™s a growing MTB channel and iâ€™d love for anyone to check it out. Just a post to try my best to help out a small YT channel.

I wanted to promote a guy who works pretty hard on his videos, but doesnâ€™t get enough recognition. Heâ€™s a MTB youtuber based in Southern California. All of his videos are pretty wholesome, and heâ€™s an older guy just documenting his life. Heâ€™s been doing youtube for a good while now but hasnâ€™t gotten any traction. Would appreciate it if you checked him out and decided for yourself if you wanted to subscribe.
