Don't click here That was not a click-bait, or maybe it was. I don't know. My mom who is 42 yrs old thinks that she has liver cancer. She has reached this conclusion by knowing about the symptoms of liver cancer. Usually I would have laughed away this idea, but this time, the feeling is different. Almost all the symptoms match and she just did a CT-scan and my father has gone out to get the report. We eagerly wait about it and just wish that she does not have malignancy. Well, sorry for posting this on this sub, I know that you guys want to have fun, but you know, if I posted this here, there would be 60% chance that people will not see it and 40% chance someone will. Thanks for reading this IF you did and, I don't know. I'm so fuckin' tense, I don't really what to do.
