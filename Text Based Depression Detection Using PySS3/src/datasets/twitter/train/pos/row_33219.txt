What do you usually eat at your breakfast and what country do you live? I live in the northeast of Brazil and we usually eat cuscuz, a mix of corn flour and cassava starch humidified and steamed, it looks like a bread at the end. It is eated with milk, fried eggs or meat. For me, there's nothing better.
