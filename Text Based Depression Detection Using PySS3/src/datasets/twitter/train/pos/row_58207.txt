Is this a glitch in the human body or am i just really strong? Ok so this evening i was trying to cut something with a knife so i put my left hand at the opposite side of the knife to keep it still and i pushed the knife into the object as hard as i can (ik im a real dumbass ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸). Anyways the knife eventually went straight through the object and went half way through my ring finger until it hit the bone and my finger started dripping a shit tone of blood. But the weird thing is that i literally felt *NO PAIN* like 0% pain. Thankfully nobody was in the kitchen so i just rushed to the bathroom as fast as i can and put it under the rushing water of the sink. STILL NO PAIN. After a little bit of it being underwater, i tested it and i could perfectly move it with no pain again and i could LITERALLY see the bone and the meat inside that was damaged by the knife too! Then i went to the hospital and they gave me a few stitches. Tell me what you think ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
