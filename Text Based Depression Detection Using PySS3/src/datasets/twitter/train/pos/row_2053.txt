I'm Brian Kemp.  I'm Brian Kemp. I'm so conservative, I blow up government spending. 

I own guns that no one is takin' away. 

My chainsaws are ready to rip up some regulation. I got a big truck just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself. 

Yup, I just said that. I'm Brian Kemp. If you want a politically incorrect conservative, that's me.
