Open windows are amazing I have recently discovered the glory of having the windows in your room open. I live in a very rural area and the temperature is very nice at the moment. Having the windows open fills my room with the sounds of the country as well as cools my room off significantly. For any with similar circumstances I highly suggest trying this for yourselves. By the way, if my diction is a bit formal I am half way through writing an essay.
