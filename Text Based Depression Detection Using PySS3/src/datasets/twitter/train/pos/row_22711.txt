does anyone here fear death? iâ€™m a little scared of the aftermath, the unknowing. is there a heaven and hell? do i get reincarnated? does my spirit continue living on earth? or does my consciousness just float through space for eternity? what if my spirit doesnâ€™t even leave my body? what if i wasnâ€™t good enough for a heaven and then get tortured for eternity? but itâ€™s also sort of exciting to not know, but does that mean iâ€™m excited to die and find out? maybe. i donâ€™t particularly fear death though, i (almost) welcome it.

but at the same time, i strangely fear the absence of â€˜beingâ€™. not being with my friends and family and the ones i love, just suddenly gone from universe. iâ€™m scared of my friends and family laughing and having fun without me, sort of like FOMO. to put it simply, iâ€™m not afraid of dying, but iâ€™m afraid i havenâ€™t lived enough.

i hope if i do die i have a lot of people that miss me. if i had to choose the way iâ€™d die, probably murdered by some ghost killer and then getting my own Netflix documentary. or maybe a crazy freak accident that results in some new law like â€œitâ€™s now illegal to drive forklifts down the highway in Florida because this one guy was stupid and died from itâ€ or something. iâ€™d want to leave some sort of impact, no matter how small. but i want to hear your thoughts
