You might think itâ€™s cool to be a bad person now but... Sooner or later your peers are going to start realizing being an asshole for no reason is actually incredibly stupid and theyâ€™ll distance themselves from rude and inconsiderate people plus being nice to everyone is immensely beneficial in ways you might not even imagine.

When youâ€™re nice to people theyâ€™re more likely to respect and want to help you in the future plus you make more friends which essentially means you meet better friends and better people, people feel more comfortable around you and share more with you.

Always keep this in mind: othersâ€™ success is my success. When other people are happy theyâ€™re more likely to make you happy directly and indirectly and when other people succeed in school or at their jobs youâ€™re also more likely to succeed and to be happy.

TL;DR:
Be nice to others and try to help everyone and youâ€™ll help the world be a better place for yourself in a much more meaningful way than you can imagine.
