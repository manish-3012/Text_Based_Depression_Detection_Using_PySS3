There needs to be more media from the other side of history Likethere needs to be movies like all is quiet on the Western front and my honor was loyalty the abouther movie think it's called 1944 but those movies all showed the point of view of the bad guys and I'd like to see more like maybe a Soviets pov during the war crimes they did or something

Especially because after getting some research there's alot of really cool and good people who happen to be part of the wourng part of history

Like imagine a call of duty 2 style campaign about invading Russia it would be awesome but we never see there pov
