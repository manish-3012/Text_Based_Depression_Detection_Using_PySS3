What's the weirdest song lyrics you know? Mine would probably be 

"We could have more fun with three Tell your mum you're gonna have a lot of fun, but don't tell daddy that's a no no If she's up for some you could even bring your mum she's kinda cute and she's got a thing for me"

Or

 "I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to god"
