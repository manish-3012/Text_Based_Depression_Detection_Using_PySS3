Motivation group I've been feeling demotivated lately so I had an idea that might work. A small group of 5 people around the same age (15-18) where we all send a message saying what our life is like right now and how we want to change it in a few months. After that we all work on changing our lives on the way we want to and return on March 1st where we talk about how successful or unsuccessful this was for us. Its a far fetched idea but I think it could work. Message me if you want to try it out!
