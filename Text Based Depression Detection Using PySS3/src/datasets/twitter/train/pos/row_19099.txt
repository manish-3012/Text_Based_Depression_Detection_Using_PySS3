Iâ€™m ready to get downvoted but the mods where just doing there jobs Witch-hunting causes suicide. The pedo was wrong but the best thing to do is make a post without usernames and contact reddit admins and the mods. I believe the girl but witch hunting still causes problems. Itâ€™s easy to not meantion a username and just report to the mods. Soon she can just appeal and probably will be unbanned. The pedo should also be banned and I think it is. 

Both sides where wrong (but the pedo was a lot wronger)
