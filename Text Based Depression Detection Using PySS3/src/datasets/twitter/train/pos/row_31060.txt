ok im really worried about this and would appreciate some advice thank you so first of all, my school is fucking useless at sex ed and has hardly taught me anything, i (15M) have only recently discovered that im supposed to be able to pull my foreskin back far behind the tip (i wouldnâ€™t have even known it was possible without porn), im not able to do that which is supposedly very bad for me sexually, im nervous enough about that shit so this really sucks 

i am able to pull my foreskin back when soft but parts of it are stuck or attached to my penis so it really stings, i canâ€™t pull it all the way on one side, and if i then get hard it hurts like hell the way it stretches 

what am i supposed to do about this? and feel free to ask away if ive missed any details i may need to share thank you :)
