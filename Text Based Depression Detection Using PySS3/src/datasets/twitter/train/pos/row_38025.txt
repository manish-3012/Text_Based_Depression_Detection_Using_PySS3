Do you think there's more bisexual females and lesbians than gays? I am almost pretty sure that's true. In fact most girls are bisexuals to some degree while it's rare for any guy to get even slightly attracted to another guy. In porn sites, "lesbian" is from the top searches and top categories watched by females. Gay porn however has very rare female viewers for some reason. There's some youtube videos where a random girl makes out other random girls on streets( Ik it's weird) which I am quite sure is not staged. Girls feel much more comfortable with other girls even sexually. If it was a dude doing that he'd be instant "creep" to them that he'd get in jail. What do you think about that?
