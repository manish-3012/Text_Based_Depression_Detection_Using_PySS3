My friend has an eating disorder and I don't know how to help Hey, so my friend has an eating disorder and barely eats, and when they do, they try to throw it back up.

I've tried to help them by telling them the risks but they're obsessed with wanting to lose weight even though their body is at the limit and they won't listen to me. I've tried to convince them to get a therapist but they won't listen.

I've tried to contact their parents but their parents are absolute shit and don't give a shit about them. I'm genuinely worried about my friend and idk what to do. 

Do you have any tips/any ways to try and help me to help them?
