My grandparents threw away MY metal detector So I had the thing for years, I'm pretty sure I bought it at a thrift store. Well, my mom probably bought it for me, but still. It was mine and I was the only one who used it. Years ago I put it in the garage and haven't really used it again because there really isn't anywhere around me to use it. Well my aunt mentioned needing one the other day and I was like "cool, you can borrow mine. Just let me see what stuff you find in your yard though." 

So today I go looking in the garage and my grandma comes in and she's like "are you looking for something?"

Me: "Yeah. *My* metal detector. That I had in the garage. I haven't seen it for a while."

Her: "Oh yeah, your grandpa said that was a piece of junk. He probably threw it away."

Me: "But it was *mine*! I bought it. And it worked fine when I out it in here."

Her: *laughs* "No, I'm pretty sure your mom bought that for you. Me and your grandpa were thinking of buying a more expensive one for us."

Me: "Still, that was mine! Can you buy me a new one?"

Her: "Why would I do that?!"

Like.... what?! I don't throw away your shit and not tell you! I have never thrown away anything they own! They've never shown any interest in wanting to get one or even using the one I had, but all of a sudden they want a more "high-end" one after throwing *mine* away!
