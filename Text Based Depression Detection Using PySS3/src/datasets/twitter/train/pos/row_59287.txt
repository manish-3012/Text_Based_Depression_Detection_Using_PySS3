Hi guys i just wanted to let you know I was at my train station waiting for my next train to arrive (i have to get back from school alone by train) and some guy came to me (bear in mind im sat down at a bench a bit far away from the actual station since all the seats were occupied and i couldnt be bothered to stay up).

So anyway this guy comes up to me and tells me that it was a good choice of taking a coca cola zero sugar since he told me that in normal ones they put 8 sugar cubes, i then agree awkwardly with him and he goes to another bench extra far.
Odd right but nothing to be really scared of.

Now a few minutes pass and i sent a message to my group chat talking about what happened (since nothing much happens around here and it was a bit funny) and when im done messaging he comes back telling me that he was wrong and he searched it up and there are 13 sugar cubes in a medium bottle.
Now i agree awkwardly again and he goes back to his bench.

Now heres the kicker, i send another message to my group chat saying he came back again.

And one of my friends out of nowhere starts telling me to run to a safe and public spot back at the station with video surveillance,

Me trusting my friends gets up takes my bags and goes to the station, i then ask why, and he tells me in these exact words

"Its an approach technique"

So umm yeah tl,dr a guy i think tried to kidnap me or something.

I gotta say its a lot less frightening than i thought it would be but its still weird non the less.

Thank you for listening.
