Fellow JoJo fans, I've come up with my own stand. Want to rate it? Thoughts? My sthando, electric hallucination. 


**Appearance**: An elite class samurai with a masked helmet, armour similar to madara uchiha and other old samurai armour. Wields a katana


**Ability**: Fucks up chemistry. If it's katana cuts you, the real damage will be done with the exchange of electrons of your body, causing your body to be really unstable and shit.


It's secondary ability: it can change elements. Like it can change any atom into any element from the periodic table, including all the isotopes. 


It also has full control over the atoms. So in theory, it can make a nuclear bomb out of nearly and literally anything. 



**Stand stats**:


_Destructive capability_: A


_Pricision_: A


_Speed_: C



_Development potential_: E



_Range_: C



_Durability_: B
