Most of the time I donâ€™t see the point in talking to people about myself I just donâ€™t feel right talking to people about serious things that bother me. At the end of the day they can only do so much and itâ€™s hard to get people to understand sometimes. I just feel so much more at ease internalising things, people just complicate stuff. People put so much pressure on me and makes me feel wrong for being who I actually am. Iâ€™m someone who doesnâ€™t really care much about what other people think of me but sometimes it really annoys me when people try tell me how Iâ€™m supposed to be. I guess everyone feels like this, itâ€™s not a particularly special thing to say. People probably think this is nothing of substance, that I have no substance but itâ€™s whatever. This is probably the most Iâ€™ll ever say about myself and the only time Iâ€™ll ever say something about myself. It kinda makes me happy that this is gonna get lost in a sea of posts. 

Iâ€™m really happy and I hope that youâ€™re happy too. Please go on and live your best life. I hope many blessings come your way. 

P.S. I do have friends
