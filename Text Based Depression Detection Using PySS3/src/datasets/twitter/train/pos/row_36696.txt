middle finger to everything sticking my middle finger up is a thing iâ€™ve kinda always done but i do it more now even though i interact with less people

like a couple minutes ago i caught myself sticking my middle finger up to the spoon i dropped. 

itâ€™s just a reflex at this point. this morning i accidentally did it to my 6 year old sister because she always sticks her tongue out at me and like i didnâ€™t even think about it but i just went ðŸ–•ðŸ¼ew no thumb in this emoji thatâ€™s gross
