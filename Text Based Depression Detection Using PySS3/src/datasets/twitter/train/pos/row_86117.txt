Campaign to bring back bangs for men Every guy has a fade and has to have a steady supply of wax to keep their hair prim and proper.

I believe we must put an end to this and allow men to wear bangs once again.

Men with high hairlines can hide it

Men with low hairlines won't need to go to the barber as often

bald men never needed to care about it in the first place

And no more expensive maintenance wax to keep it styled

Vote me as your local governor, and believe me every school will allow bangs once again. Bangs have been stigmatized as emo for far too long, and must be re established as the definitive cut.
