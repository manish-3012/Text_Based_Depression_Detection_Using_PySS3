Fuck fuck fuck fuck I've been quarantined with my grandma for 2 weeks(my mom had covid) and I was about to be ready to go home. But then some shit went down.


My mom works with the elderly and recently one of her clients had a heart attack and died, and now the other two have covid so now my mom has to stay at work for another 2 weeks and I have to be with my grandma for another two weeks.


On the bright side, I get to play with my grandma's puppies,but I'm still upset because I can't go home to my cat
