my ghost room mate so i live with my family but i live in a secluded part of the house so I'm usually alone (meaning i don't hear any sounds or stuff like that). so naturally when i started hearing stuff like footsteps or water i didn't know what to think of it because nobody but me really needs to be going up to my room for any reason. my brothers all have their own rooms with their own stuff so they wouldn't need anything in mine and my parents just don't care about going up here at all. 

so i was a little freaked out by this, but about a week ago the thing started turning on the faucet in my bathroom or moving around my stuff in my closet while i slept, just normal ghost stuff. 

well since i doubt I'm getting rid of him anytime soon ill just give him a name, its going to be Jeremy for no particular reason at all.  

he keeps turning on my Xbox or tapping on my window pane. honestly i don't mind it, its nice to have something to keep me company.
