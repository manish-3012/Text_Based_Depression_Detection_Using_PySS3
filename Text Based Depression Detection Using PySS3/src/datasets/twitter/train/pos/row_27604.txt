school is killing me and i'm so frustrated Ever since school has been solely online, I've only been struggling and struggling. I'm enrolled in several advanced classes, and my teachers don't seem to care about mental health or home-life situations. I can't understand anything that they're 'teaching', and everything seems so overwhelming to the point where I just break down and panic.

I can't focus, it's almost impossible. It's so much better to work in school, where there is help right at my fingertips, but I can't get it here. I can't get help inside of my room. There's too much at my disposal, this is my room, this is where I was supposed to escape and relax from life, but I'm no longer allowed that luxury.

I have 22 missing assignments, and they're just going to stack up from here. I can't focus. I'm so exhausted from trying my hardest and only getting a return or a bad grade, so I've just given up. It's too hard to focus. Teachers are unforgiving, but I'm barely doing the bare minimum of waking up and eating.

It constantly feels like there's too much going on while nothing is happening, I get off-track, I get distracted, I reward myself with a break after doing half of an assignment. I wish I could focus and work but I can't. I can't!! 

I'm so tired man. I can't be at home.

I'm always alone here. I have no one. I can't learn, and I don't have anyone to help. Group chats exchanging answers and papers aren't enough for me. 

I wanna learn.

I can't. Not here.
