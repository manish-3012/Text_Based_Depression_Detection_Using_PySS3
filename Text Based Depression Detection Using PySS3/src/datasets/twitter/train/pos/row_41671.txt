I accidentally ate a RAISIN cinnamon roll I can't express how utterly humiliated and disappointed I am. 
My grandma baked cinnamon rolls and desperately wanted me to try one, so I did (sceptically). First bite in this slimy object with terrible texture and taste slithers down my unsuspecting throat. I was like, ehh probably some clumped up cinnamon. I just couldn't shake that taste, it seemed to come back with every bite. 
Then I finally looked in the roll. There lied multiple raisins...
I don't know how to recover from this. The taste still lingers to this moment. If any of you have any tips on how to recover, both emotionally and physically, I'm all ears.
