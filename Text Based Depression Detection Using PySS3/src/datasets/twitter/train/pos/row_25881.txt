Double period music, really, really? An hour and twenty minutes of attempting to plagerise some dumb blues song, note for note, first thing on a Friday morning. Who the fuck do you think you are Mrs redacted? Fuck you, for giving me a detention for being shit at chords, it's not my fault. How would you like it if I punched you for being ugly? Double period music is actually the most chromosome sufficient idea I can think of, i would honestly rather sit through a triple period with my English teacher, who smells if horse shit. But I guess I have much more serious problems to be thinking about, such as my formal education, amongst others.
