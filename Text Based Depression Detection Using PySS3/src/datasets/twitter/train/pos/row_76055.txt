I hate people telling me how to enjoy a video game. Like the owner told us "You won't have fun speedrunning Minecraft". And even though the server was laggy af we beat the game in 2 hours and it was a lot of fun. It's a sandbox game goddammit I can do whatever I want. I can speedrun killing someone in sims 4 if I want to, you may not enjoy it but I could.
