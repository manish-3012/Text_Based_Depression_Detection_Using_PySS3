My friend just canceled for the second Friday in a row We were gonna take edibles last Friday, she said she'd get them and then we were gonna meet in the city. I got ready, so did she, then she checks her phone and it turns out the guy she was gonna buy from texted her hours before saying he didn't have any that day. So you know, we made do. We were supposed to do it today, this time I had the edibles, I didn't do shit in my final class so I could get ready and be there on time, she got ready too. She kept sending messages about how she couldn't get her eyeliner right, and it eventually turned into a full panic attack, and now she doesn't wanna go out. Life is so full in quarantine and this shit was the only thing I was looking forward to. I don't really blame her, I just wish she could stick to plans better. Im ready and I look good as shit but I'm just chilling in bed. Asked another one of my friends but he's busy. Kinda dissapointed. Wanted the edibles to be a social thing, I don't wanna take them alone. So now my Friday isn't anything again.
