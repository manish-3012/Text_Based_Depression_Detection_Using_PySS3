Sub is going downhill, heres something you should read if you think that someone is "shit" when they reject you. First of all, I really dislike where this sub is going, this is not what I joined r/teenagers for, I joined you all for the sake of relatable memes, funny posts and just people I can really relate to. However, recently, I have been seeing people degrading others just because they rejected you. First off what the hell.

  
If someone were to reject, you need to accept why they did so and just hope for better next time. You need to understand that if you chose to confess, it was your choice to take the shot to see if they liked you back as well. You have no right to go ranting about how shit they are for rejecting you. Nothing is wrong with them, and nothing is wrong with you either. What's wrong is if you went and started shit talking about them for rejecting you because you think you're so high and mighty. If all you were going to do was to talk shit about them in the end, what even made you like them in the first place? I seriously don't get it.

You both probably had a difference of personality, or a difference in lifestyle, the first person you meet and fall for may not be the one you will love forever. It's not their fault for having a preference, or even having their own taste in things. If the person is evil enough to say things like, "ew", or literally degraded you for asking them out, then they are the one's at fault. But if all they said was, "I don't like you back, sorry", or "Thanks", they at least had the heart to let you down softly and not in a mean way. Just be patient and you'll find someone else in the world for you. You don't have to have a S/O as of right now, we are all teenagers y'all can chill, times on your side.  


Thank you :)
