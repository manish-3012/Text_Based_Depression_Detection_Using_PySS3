I just got my drivers licence After 3 attemps i finally got my drivers licence. The only bad part is that I can't drive on my own I need to have somebody who has had a licence for 10 years and not have any speeding tickets since i'm only 17 years old and you need to be 18 before you can drive on your own in Denmark
