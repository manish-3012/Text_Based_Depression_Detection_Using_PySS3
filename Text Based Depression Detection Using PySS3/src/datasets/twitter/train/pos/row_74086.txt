Dawg, I really should go back to my old ways Ever since I started being more open ive gotten unlucky with people. Both friendly and flirty.

Like I donâ€™t get it, now that Iâ€™m actually being open and tell you things about me so we can talk itâ€™s like is not interesting.

But when I used to be the mysterious fellow who didnâ€™t say shit, I was in gcs, people talked to me, some of them even went as far as to say they found me attractive and I didnâ€™t even shown my face.

I just donâ€™t get it, man
