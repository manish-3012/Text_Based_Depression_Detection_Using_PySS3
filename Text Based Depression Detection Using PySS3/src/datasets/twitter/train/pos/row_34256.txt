You know what, fuck this Ok so I made a post earlier about how my posts always get downvoted even if itâ€™s a question or something like that or whatever. And I said that Iâ€™ve been on Reddit for too long and this guy who was kinda a jerk was like fuck off you havenâ€™t even been on reddit for that long (1 year actually which is pretty long imo) and was like only people who care about karma are reposters in this sub blah blah blah. ANYWAY. Iâ€™m going to comment something on this post and to show that I donâ€™t care about karma I want you all to downvote it as much as you can.
