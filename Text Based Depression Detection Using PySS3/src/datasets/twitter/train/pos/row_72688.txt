Family link sh** Now I don't know if that flair is right

Basically I'm 17 and my parent treats me like a 8 year old who just got a phone. I have this sh*tty parental control rubbish on my phone and its so frustrating. Today I was studying a lot using YouTube trying to understand this math rubbish and my very short screen time popped up!

Time for a break

My parent will think I'm just playing games or on any other app. I always get so angry when I see this and I'm asking if anyone has any way to get past this??? If yes please share it in the comments
