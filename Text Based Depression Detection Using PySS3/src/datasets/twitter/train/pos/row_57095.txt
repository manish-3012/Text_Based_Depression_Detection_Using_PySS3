Girlfriend might be pregnant... HELP So yes, Iâ€™ll say it right out the bat: poor choice on my part. Me and my girlfriend were having unprotected sex, and iâ€™m afraid i might have accidentally cummed in her. I pulled out, but felt a little squirt right before I did. Anyways, she doesnâ€™t know. Is there any way I could slip her a Plan B without her noticing? Can i even buy Plan B at age 16? If worse comes to worse and she figures sheâ€™s pregnant, are there any methods other than coat hanger? Or, perhaps, should I cut my losses and fess up and get the plan B over with? Both our parents would disown us if they even caught a whiff of us even having sex, and we both have bright futures that wouldnâ€™t be able to stand against this horrible mistake. Tried to make burner account, wouldnâ€™t let me post. Please donâ€™t come at me.
