Whenever someone tells me â€œoh you look like you should go into STEMâ€ it feels like such a cop out answer. Oh yeah? I look like I should do stem? What even is stem to you? Is is because Iâ€™m good at science and math? Yeah? IM GOOD AT THEM BECAUSE IM SMART AND WORK FOR MY DAMN GRADES. I donâ€™t know what screams stem about me if you actually got to know me. I really donâ€™t. Stem is so broad as well, so it pretty much tells me nothing. I am so much more than math and science. I want to know what you think of me, as a PERSON, with a personality, with real qualities that go beyond just having good grades. I donâ€™t even want to do STEM. I find it soulless and devoid of joy and life and humanity. I wish I could be you, my best friend. I wish someone would take the time to think about who I am beyond the surface level and tell me something like â€œI could see you being a pediatrician because of how kind and caring you are. You just exude the ability to work with little kids.â€ 

Iâ€™m sorry. Rant over.
