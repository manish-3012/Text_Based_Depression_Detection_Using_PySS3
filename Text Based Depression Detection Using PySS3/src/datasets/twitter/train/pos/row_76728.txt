For those of you who got scolded by teachers recently or before There are 2 possibilities,one the teacher is a dick or two the teacher cares for you and wants you to change. The teacher could have saved the trouble and not say anything, but they didn't, meaning that they care for you, being scolded by teacher may not be a bad thing, it points out your mistake that was invisible to you, and the teacher wants to see you improve of it and succeed. Sure the teacher may get angry for a while, but in the end they just want the best of you. So if you're dwelling on a mistake and scolding your teacher pointed out, crush that thought and throw it away and take the teacher's advice, try again and show that you are sincere, that is the key to success. I am encouraging those who feel and down as well as myself who recently got reprimanded. Don't dwell, your teachers scold you to point your mistakes, If you don't notice your mistakes and carry them to the real world, the consequences will be much more dire. Thanks for listening to my pep talk and hope it helps you overcome your sadness on being scolded
