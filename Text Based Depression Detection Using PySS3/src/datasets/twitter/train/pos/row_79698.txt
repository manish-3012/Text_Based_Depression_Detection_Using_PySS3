I'm trying to show my younger brothers songs in the rap and hip hop genre that doesn't glorify sex, violence, and drugs. Help me out with suggestions Okay so my younger brothers are in the pre teen stages, listening to music and such. They're listening to lots of mumble rap, too much glorifying drugs and sex and violence. Their foster mom doesn't really like this. 

So she asked me to make them a rap playlist with minimal to no cussing that doesn't glorify drugs and sex and violence. I mean, there can be cuss words, but not like "Fuck, sh!t, b!itch, pu$$$y, Goddamn, N-word" constantly all throughout the song.

I've gathered a couple dozen artists I think is appropriate for a soon to be 13 year old to listen to. (Depending on the song lyrics) 

Outkast, Denzel Curry, Eminem, Big Sean, Lil Baby, Joyner Lucas, D Smoke, Kid Cudi, Tee Grizzley, Jay Z, J. Cole, Cordae, Tupac, Kendrick Lamar, Lupe Fiasco, Rod Wave, Polo G, Caleb Colossus, Montana of 300, Dax, Coolio, old school Will Smith, The Notorious B.I.G., Run DMC, Mac Miller 

So, that's what I've come up with so far, but I'd like to share more songs/artists. Music has a large occupancy in my life, so sharing music with my younger brothers is something I'd like to have with them. We're not as connected as we used to be, sadly do to living in separate homes. 

Can you guys give me songs to share with them that don't rely on glorifying lots of sex and violence and drugs? I'm mostly looking for rap and hip hop songs, because that's what they listen to

But anything will help. Thanks!
