Today was fucking insane  So today I was planning on asking my crush out and I asked her only to have her reject me. I was prepared so i was ok with it. 30 minutes later I came downstairs to see my mom on the phone. My dad said it was an emergency and my grandma was sick. My mom was crying later on so I consoled her. Everyone is worried at the moment.
