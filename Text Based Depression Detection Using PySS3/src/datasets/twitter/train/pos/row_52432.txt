a guy unfriended me on snapchat today after i sent half my face so i added this guy on quick add. he sent me a full face snap. i snapped back half of my face smiling and then he unfriended me. iâ€™m kind of upset about it because his brother is good friends with my brother. the guy who unfriended me is nice to my brother but for some reason he just doesnâ€™t like me? but why?
