Iâ€™m just tired. Mentally. I donâ€™t know. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I died a long time ago. I wanted to die, and in a way I did. Iâ€™m not the same person I was

I know the â€œohh youâ€™re a teenager youâ€™re just going through what everyone else has!â€ I dont want to hear it. 

Did you all fucking want to throw yourself off a cliff? Curl up into a ball and die, because everything you know is destroying you. You canâ€™t breathe and the weight of the world is crushing you. Itâ€™s grabbed you by the throat and is choking you to death. Youâ€™re throat is closed up and youâ€™re just hysterically laughing at this cruel joke. Havenâ€™t eaten or slept for days with a wide eyed, broken laugh 

just laughing. a cold, uneasy, broken laugh

I went through that and I feel like I canâ€™t feel happiness anymore. I wanted to die so bad then I donâ€™t know what happened. Things donâ€™t make me happy like they used to. Iâ€™m just considering working myself to death. I want to make myself of use before I completely give up. I canâ€™t enjoy the journey so might as well only aim for the destination

..im just tired.... sorry......
