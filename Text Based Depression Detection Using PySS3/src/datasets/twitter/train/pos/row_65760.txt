My older brother keeps trying to make me earn money and start a business Here's some info: I'm a 13-year-old girl and my brother is 25. So basically I am an artist. I paint and draw and do stuff like that and today my stickers came in the mail and the seller sent a thank you note and a business card. When he saw them he said this is goals and I should have a business too. But the thing is, I don't want to do that. I just want to create art and just be a kid. I also have an animal crossing twitter account that's kinda popular and I was watching an ac YouTuber. He told me I should be making videos and I don't want to!! I just want to enjoy myself and WATCH A FUCKING YOUTUBE

VIDEO. he has been saying this since last year but holyyyy it's actually so annoying and rude. Does he not get that I don't want to start a fucking business? I just turned 13. But I don't know what to do. He says I do this all the time, that I get a following then I leave.  He says this because I used to like a game called animal jam, joined an app called AJ Amino and got a few thousand followers. I was also 9 at the time.  Anyways I don't know what to do. He wants me to do art commissions, make youtube videos AND run an Etsy shop. I am only 13. What do i do?
