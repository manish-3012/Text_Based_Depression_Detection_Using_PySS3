What do i do A few months ago i told someone i liked them, but they said they didn't feel the same way, now I feel like she's dropping hints, she's a lot nicer to me than anyone else (and they notice) and she's always asking me to play games with her. I'm afraid to ask again because I don't want to seem pushy. Am i just being too optimistic?
