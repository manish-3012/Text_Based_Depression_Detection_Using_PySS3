Whatâ€™s better Online school or in person school? Iâ€™d love to know ur opinions! Online school is really boring for me. Idk why. I wish we could all communicate and you know be a class then just one person doing school. My introvert self feels like my time is being used by school, instead of trying to do my passion which is weird
