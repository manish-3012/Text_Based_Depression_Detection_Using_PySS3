I think I'm getting better. (Trigger warning i guess) A couple months ago (June 21st to be exact) I attempted to end my own life.

I won't get into why, just that I felt alone and unheard.

But since, I've been talking to people more, I've been on antidepressants, been going out more. Exercising.  And I feel that, I've gotten better, I feel happier. I've been spending more time with my family rather than shutting myself in.

I know that attempting to kill myself wasn't the right thing to do, but, honestly it's the best thing I've done in a while because it put me on a good path.




(disclaimer thing): I AM IN NO WAY SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I GOT LUCKY BY GETTING THE APPROPRIATE HELP.
