Is it normal for me to avoid my cousins?? We don't connect with each other, and I don't see the point. I wasn't really like this, but they were usually the ones who started it first Â«i.e. not inviting me to their outings together as cousins (probably because I'm the youngest one), excluding me in family gatheringsÂ». I remember that time that I desperately wanted to go with them so I begged to join. I used to desperately wanted to join them.

Now it seems like the tables have turned. They're the ones trying to include me, and now I'm not the one wanting to. I don't really like to join them as much, though they've started to open up with me and try to hang out. 

Hell, I try to not to sit beside them and avoid eye contact with them. I talk very minimally with them, although we have family gatherings routinely.
