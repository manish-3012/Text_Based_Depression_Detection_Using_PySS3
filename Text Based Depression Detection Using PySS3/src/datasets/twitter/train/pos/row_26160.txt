My mom literally yells at me to get out of the house but the moment I'm asked to hang out with my friends my mom yells at me anyway? So during the summer I was out of the house basically everyday walking around town with friends. But than everyone just stoped inviting me to hang out. Meanwhile my mom yells at me asking why I stopped getting out of the house but than just and little bit ago my one friend called me and asked if I wanted to hang out with her. 

I go and ask my mom if she can drive me and she just says no. 


She won't give me a reason why not but she just keeps saying no. 

Idek what to think rn I'm mad and upset
