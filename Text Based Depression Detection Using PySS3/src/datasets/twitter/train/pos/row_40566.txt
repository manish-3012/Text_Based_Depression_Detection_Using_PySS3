I, as a whole, have changed...  Looking back... In four years... and even just one year... I have changed so much as a person. My interests, my outlook on the world, my ability to trust, and so many other things. Maybe someone will see this, maybe no one will, and maybe this will reach hot. None of that matters. My ideas and thoughts are so different. I hope by typing this down I can get it off my mind. And I can improve and, of course, **change**.
