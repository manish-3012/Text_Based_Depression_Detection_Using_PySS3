I hate assignments that make you feel dumb for sharing your thoughts we had an assignment recently in sociology where we read a text called "body rituals of the Nacirema" it goes over all of these things they do, and then at the end reveals that it was talking about americans (nacirema is american backwards). I am someone who tends to share my thoughts on things. this text was also written in the 50s, so I disagree with many things (for example, people have a medicine cabinet full of things that they don't know what they do, but they hang on to it just in case. my family does not keep medicine that we don't know the purpose of.) all in all, it made me feel like an idiot for not recognizing that. and part of the reason I felt like an idiot was because I shared my thoughts about all the things we read. if I hadn't shared my thoughts, I would not have felt like an idiot. If you want students to share their thoughts, don't make them feel dumb for doing it.
