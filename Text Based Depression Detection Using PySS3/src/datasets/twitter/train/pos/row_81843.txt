I'm a dumbass So I've had a crush on this girl for the last few months, and at our school every year there's this thing called a Military Ball.



It's basically a formal dinner party that people in JROTC can go to, and a big part about it is bringing someone as your date. 



So about 5 or 6 months ago, I was sitting at lunch, and since my crush was also in JROTC, she came up to me and literally just told me she needed a date and wanted to go with me. 



So obviously, since she was my crush and literally just asked me to go to a party as her date, I said "Nah I don't really wanna go." My dumbass literally got asked to a dinner party by my fucking crush, and for some reason, I decided to say no.



What the hell is wrong with me? Why do I do stuff like this to myself? The worst part is I didn't even think anything about it until like a week ago when I just thought "Holy shit I could've gone out with my crush."



TL;DR: When my crush asked me to come with her to the one part of JROTC that doesn't suck as her date, my dumbass said no.
