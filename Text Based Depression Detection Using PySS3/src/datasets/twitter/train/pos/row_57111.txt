My step mom is my English teacher and itâ€™s lowkey annoying So my dad met my step mom because she was my moms college roommate. My parents got divorced when I was 6 after my mom came out as gay during my parents wedding anniversary party. My dad got married to my step mom when I was 10 and my mom got married to my other step mom when I was 11. My mom and dad are basically best friends even thought they had 4 kids together then got divorced so I see both sets of parents all the time. 

My step mom (married to my dad) got a job at my school and now sheâ€™s my English teacher. I have never heard so many step mom what are you doing jokes in my life. I love my step mom sheâ€™s literally my third mom and my god mother. But itâ€™s annoying when people ask if my dad met my step mom cause of school, or if my little bro and my step mom do shit together. 

Itâ€™s just disgusting. Not to mention I have had multiple guys ask me for my step moms number or snap.
