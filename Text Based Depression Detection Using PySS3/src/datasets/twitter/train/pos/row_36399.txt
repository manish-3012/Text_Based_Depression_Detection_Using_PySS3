Everyone in this sub is so immature (but like, in a fun way :) ) I'm pretty sure it's no secret that I love to bake. And whenever I make something I'm proud of, I usually post about it here. 

But whenever I post anything with a white icing on top (especially cinnamon rolls), half of the comments are ppl asking me why I came all over the food. 

Don't get me wrong. I love cum jokes as much as the next guy, but christ u guys are immature sometimes ðŸ˜
