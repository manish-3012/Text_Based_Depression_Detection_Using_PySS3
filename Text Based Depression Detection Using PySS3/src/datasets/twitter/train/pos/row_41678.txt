How to I meet people and actually keep talking to them Seems like if I ever meet someone in a class or something, any conversations just stay there and we don't really become friends. How to I get past that without overstepping or forcing it too hard?

On a related note, how do I start to become friends with a girl without being too friendly giving her the wrong idea?
