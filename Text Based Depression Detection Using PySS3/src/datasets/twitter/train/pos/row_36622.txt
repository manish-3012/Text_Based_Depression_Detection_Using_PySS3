My parents can really be peices of shit sometimes. My father keeps telling me that if i want to get done by 4:00 (half an hour past what time school gets out), I cant take breaks during the school day since I'm online. 

The only break I get during the day is my lunch break, so my dad is pretty much saying, if I dont wanna work all fucking day, I dont get to eat. 

I was on my lunch break just a minute ago, and got a game, when my mother walks in and gets all pissy at me because I'm not doing schoolwork. 

I'm getting sad now ;-;
