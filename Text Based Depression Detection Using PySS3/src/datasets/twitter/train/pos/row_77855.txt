I lost my mom to covid the day before thanksgiving Around October 15th my mom began to display symptoms of covid and on the 18th of October she was taken to the hospital cause she couldnâ€™t breathe. On the 28th of October she was put on a ventilator machine. The hospital called us to tell us they had no other option and my mom sounded terrified. Our final conversation together occurred that morning. They needed me to convince her to agree to it. So my final conversation with her consisted of me telling my terrified mother that she needs to do this for us. I told her I loved her and then she was put on the ventilator.

I think I regret allowing them to do that. I knew in my heart that she wouldnâ€™t survive this but I was selfish and convinced her to do it anyway and now I have to live with that guilt for the rest of my life. The following weeks were the shittiest weeks of my life.

They called me on the 25th of November to tell me my mom would die later that day. They allowed my family and I to enter the ICU to see her but through a glass window. I wasnâ€™t allowed talk to her, hold her hand, or even be in the same room as her. She was unconscious and unaware that we were there with her. I feel like a horrible human being for not being able to let her know she wasnâ€™t alone. All I can think about is how alone she must have felt before she drifted into unconsciousness.

I have nothing but hatred towards everyone who refuses to take this virus seriously. I wish these people so much misfortune and I donâ€™t care if that makes me a horrible person. I wish the president an awful life and I hope he suffers more than my mother did. And for those who do take this virus seriously, I have nothing but love for you and I hope you donâ€™t lose a loved one to this virus and if you have then I am truly sorry
