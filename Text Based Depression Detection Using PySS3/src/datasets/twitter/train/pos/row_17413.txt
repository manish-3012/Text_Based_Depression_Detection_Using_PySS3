I finally found someone in my cca whom I trust and can talk to other than mah homies I know this is my second time saying this already, but Iâ€™m so fucking happy after all thatâ€™s happened recently with my friends and family shit. Iâ€™m not gay mind you, but heâ€™s pretty much the reason why I go for basketball now since Iâ€™m in a separate group from my friends due to covid restrictions. Even though heâ€™s my junior. So if youâ€™re reading this mate and you somehow know my Reddit account, thank you for making my day :D
