Look guys, mods are people too. When you guys are on reddit or discord, can you guys please be respectful? Iâ€™m an admin for my friendâ€™s public discord server and we all just had to deal with someone harassing us for not making an mpreg channel. Like really?! We obviously wonâ€™t make one because this is a SFW server. Plus multiple people arenâ€™t comfortable with it. Also they legit targeted my friendâ€™s insecurities and called us racist and homophobic. (Most of us are LGBTQ+ so obviously not.) But  guys, please try not to be one of those people. If you call people homophobic and racist for not giving you what you want, you probably donâ€™t deserve it if youâ€™re going to be that mean about it. (Unless it comes to like actual racist and homophobic things, definitely not an mpreg channel on a discord server.) Anyways I just kind of needed to vent, I hope everyone here has a good day :)
