So I just found something out. So I discovered recently that 70% of american males are circumcised, now, I can't be the only one who thinks this is fucking wild. Like I remember a while back a friend of mine accidentally circumcised himself while having sex and everyone felt sorry that he couldn't pull up the sock on his third foot anymore. Would like to hear some thoughts on this.
