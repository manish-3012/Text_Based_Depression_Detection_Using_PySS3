a vent/rant because iâ€™m such an indecisive fucker so much backstory and context is required for u to understand here but fuck backstory you guys can make up ur own just pretend u get what iâ€™m saying

I DONT KNOW IF I STILL LIKE HIM!!! WE WERE IN THIS WEIRD QUARENTINE LIMBO FOR FOREVER SO I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY TO STOP LIKING HIM BECAUSE I FIGURED HE HAD DONE THE SAME FOR ME!!!! but now he texts me happy valentineâ€™s day and wants to vc on discord??? and i donâ€™t know if i want to do that??? which makes me feel like an ASSHOLE because i was the one pursuing him for like FOREVER and now heâ€™s the one pursuing me and it would be such an ass move after all this time to be like no thanks!!!! and i still think heâ€™s a cool dude but itâ€™s so hard to like someone in quarantine like i havenâ€™t seen him in over a year so how am i supposed to fucking know??? i donâ€™t know if i even want a relationship right now like iâ€™ll see happy couples and be like damn wish that was me but the idea of actually being somebodyâ€™s girlfriend just really weirds me out rn!! and i have like a lot of other stuff to tend to like my health and school and also i have enough stress being in a goddamn pandemic. and like whatâ€™s the point of pursuing a relationship right now while we canâ€™t even hang out bc of corona?? oh my gooooood i hate this i hate how shitty of a person this makes me feel
