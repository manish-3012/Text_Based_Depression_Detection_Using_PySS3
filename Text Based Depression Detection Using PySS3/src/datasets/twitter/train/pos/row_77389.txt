Why do I get a lecture about this? So my parents always get emotional when I joke about younger me or my birth, my dad gave a whole rant when I said: "Damn I was an ugly baby, imagine waiting nine months for such an abomination," or my mom falls silent when I say that was a annoying and ugly toddler and that I wonder how they could handle me. I'm mostly just joking, but they always have to hide their tears when I joke about **myself**.
