My sister caused my dog's trachea to collapse, what do I do? We got my dog a collar and leash to help him learn how to walk on a leash, and so she wanted to try it out on him. So my sister puts the collar and leash on him and I go back in my room and some minutes later she comes back in my room with my dog on a leash and she says "Watch this". So she pulls him and he doesnt want to move, so she forces him to move without moving (basically butt slide) and obviously this practically chokes him out and makes his trachea collapse. While not painful for a dog, it does hurt and makes it hard for them to breathe. What do I do?
