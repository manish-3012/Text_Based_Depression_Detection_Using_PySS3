I, a straight with 16M, am tying to eliminate the hate from my heart for the trans community I have watched many rightist videos and my views are fairly conservative, but if it makes them happier, why not? I still agree to many of the things that they say and I find it insulting that some extreme leftists think that everyone needs a "reeducation". Watching all these videos made me full of hate for the vocal leftists and social justice feminist warriors who I still dislike and disagree with, including the BLM movement, but I have to stop hating them. I agree with some of the thing they preach: gender equality, gay rights, no racism (I think that racism is not a big problem since there is a super small number of racists), and similar. If it makes them happier to call them by their pronouns, why not call them like that. They do not pose a threat to me or my family (Unless they teach it to small children in kindergarten who might get the wrong idea). But still I dislike people who base their whole personality around being LGBT. Also I dislike people who are LGBT for attention. However, the news that Elliot Page is trans makes me very sad. I know that he is happier, but Ellen Page doesn't exist anymore which makes me sad :( To conclude, I feel much happier thought now that I don't have hate in my heart.
