Can we stop making jokes about sh here please I've seen multiple posts today joking about it, and none of the people posting them have self harmed.

They've been on the topic of streaks mainly, which are huge achievements and seeing people joke about isn't fun...

I'm not saying that if you haven't experienced something you can never joke about it, but it's insensitive

Idk just please don't, thank you &lt;3
