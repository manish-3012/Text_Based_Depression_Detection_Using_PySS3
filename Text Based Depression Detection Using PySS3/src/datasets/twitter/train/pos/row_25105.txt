Iâ€™m having girl problems and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve known this girl a couple of years and weâ€™re dating now , but it doesnâ€™t seem like she really loves me as she says she does. For example last night she got off the phone and said nothing , and didnâ€™t text me why I find out today she got on the phone with her ex to â€œ talk about workâ€. She never starts conversations with me Iâ€™m always the one doing it. What really made me think she didnâ€™t love me is today I asked her â€œ did I do something wrong because it seems like you just donâ€™t want to talk all of a sudden?â€ And she said â€œ idk thatâ€™s just how I am sometimesâ€ , and see normally thatâ€™s okay I get it , but sheâ€™s talking to everyone else but me so how you gonna say a stupid excuse like that. I really just donâ€™t know what to do.
