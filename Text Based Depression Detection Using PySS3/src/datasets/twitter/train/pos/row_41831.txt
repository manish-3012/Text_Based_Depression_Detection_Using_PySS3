What Iâ€™ve learned as a freshman at university Unless itâ€™s a STEM class, youâ€™re gonna be talking just about philosophy and life. Literally every single class is gonna be talking about something deep. 

Iâ€™m a history major but high school history and college history are two very different things. Basically, high school more focuses on what happens but college strives to understand why something happens. 

Absolutely everything involves critical thinking. If you think you know how to critically think, you probably donâ€™t. But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll learn. 

It is soooo much better than high school. One month in and I learned to really not give a fuck. 

Itâ€™s a lot more work but itâ€™s all very doable. When you write your papers make sure you do absolutely everything the teacher tells you to do in their corrections. Youâ€™ll automatically get a better grade because they feel like you really listen to them. 

For my my nerds who never had to study, you better get some practicing in. You canâ€™t memorize your way through these classes. You need to take notes and lots of them. 

Anyway, if you have any questions. Iâ€™m all ears.
