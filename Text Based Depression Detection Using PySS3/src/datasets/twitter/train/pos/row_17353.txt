I am getting so close to committing suicide and there is nothing that you can do to stop it Right now my mom,sister,and school are being mega bitches and I'm finna go into a parent teacher conference and I know how it's going to go (it's going to go shit) plus having diabetes isn't helping at all and I'm continuing to cut myself everyday although my grandma,uncle,and father is concerned about me. I've tried calling for help.
I've attempted to commit suicide twice now and this will most likely the last one 

There is nothing you can do
