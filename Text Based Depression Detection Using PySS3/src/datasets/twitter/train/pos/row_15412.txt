Selfish dickheads in team projects So Iâ€™ve been involved in a team project in school, and thereâ€™s this one guy who has done fuck all and admits he â€œcouldnâ€™t care lessâ€ because he didnâ€™t like the task we were given. Bear in mind this was an optional project which everyone in the team applied for BY CHOICE and this guy sat there doing nothing for a whole year, knowing he didnâ€™t like the project. Worse still, the supervisors did nothing even though they knew he was doing nothing and also MENTIONED AT THE START THAT THEY WOULD REPLACE ANYONE WHO DID NO WORK (as there were others who wanted to be on the team but there werenâ€™t enough spots). Iâ€™m more pissed off at the fact that heâ€™s been able to survive effectively just because he was friendly with the supervisors. I know that life is unfair and all that and charismatic lazy fucks often win and â€œthatâ€™s lifeâ€ but man am I fucking tired of putting in work knowing someone who does fuck all is just gonna sweet-talk their way into things and potentially beat me to things that they donâ€™t ducking deserve. Anyway, rant over.
