So quick thing Dogs are inferior to cats (they are not bad just inferior) and then people say stuff like â€˜they atenâ€™t affectionateâ€™ and im just sitting yhere like bro they will sit and cuddle with you and sit on your lap. Then they sleep next to you and omg its great, along with kittens being way better than puppies as they are just so cute like omg. Anyone who disagrees with me is just wrong.
