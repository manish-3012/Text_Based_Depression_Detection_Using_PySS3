I'm bored of everything Hi everyone,

This is my first or second time posting here, I can't really remember. 

Anyway, I'm feeling super tired and bored recently. Usually, I could have fun playing video games and that would take away most of my stress after a long day of homework. Nowadays, I find little joy in playing video games and I just feel like crap after I play. 

I want to find something new in my life, because it's so gray right now. It's the same cycle over and over again, and I want to change and escape this cycle, but I don't know how. Nothing makes me excited anymore. My friends tell me its depression, but I really don't think that I'm depressed- just jaded to everything. 

This was a bit of a rant (so sorry if I flaired incorrectly), but does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to find a spark of excitement and joy in my life? Because I really need it.
