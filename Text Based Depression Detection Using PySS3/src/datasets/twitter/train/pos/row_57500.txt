I need help with this girl So like Iâ€™ve been on/off speaking to this girl for the last few months, we started in like April after I turned 17, then I annoyed her so we stopped for a few weeks, then we started again for a while; then we couldnâ€™t for a week and then for the last month or so weâ€™ve been consistently speaking and I really like her. Thereâ€™s a slight age gap, shes 19, Iâ€™m 17 so I think itâ€™s ok. I canâ€™t go meet her yet because my city is on lockdown and hers isnâ€™t meaning we canâ€™t meet and go for dinner. The only issue Iâ€™ve got with her really is she does drugs which Is a massive turn off for me (one of my friends ODâ€™d so it makes me anxious and shit) so idk what to do. I donâ€™t want her to change just for me because thatâ€™d be unfair on her so idk whether to say I donâ€™t want her doing them round me and to be safe or to tell her I donâ€™t like them at all

This girl has had a shit time with guys in the past and I really want to give her the universe because she deserves it :(
