What the fuck My parents are both extremely Republican, and I just heard my dad say to my mom:

"Hey, I came up with a new term for everyone being like "oh god wear a mask, COVID-19 will kill you" we call them Covidiots."

How in the fuck can you act like people are overexxaggerating COVID when hundreds of thousands have died from it. What in the hell is stupid about taking health precautions DURING A PANDEMIC. Aaahhhhhhh does anyone want to buy a used set of parents all offers open.
