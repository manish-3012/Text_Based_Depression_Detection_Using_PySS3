This might sound weird but 2020 so far is the best year of my life. 


I lost a total of 60 lbs, got my bmi from 32.1 to 20.9. No more Acne issues (thanks to a very clean diet). became a runner, did countless 5ks,10k and 2 half marathons (virtual races).My average grade went up from B- to A so far. I also have this new habbit of reading ( have read 26 novels so far since feb) . So I kindof figured out my depression(I was so broke from inside since last 3 years so, I guess you get it) and procrastination (sort of). And  yeah,

I also have a girlfriend now, thanks to the upfront confidence I have now.

But if your year was not that good, hugs from me mate. 2021 gonna be your year. Best of luck!
