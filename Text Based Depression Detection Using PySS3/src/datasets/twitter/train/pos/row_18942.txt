My school doesn't care about safety So I live in a very small town were we have more than 1,000 cases of covid and are now increaseing about 100 more casses a day. You would think that with so many people with it in a small place people would care a little bit about safety, right? Wrong. No one cares. I go to a Christian academy filled with racist and homophobic people, and I'm a Mexican/Persian bisexual. So yeah I just love it there. The people who go there are the type of people who still when out regularly without masks during quarantine and hugged and hanged out with friends. Two weeks ago I went to my dance team practice since it was mandatory only to find out that one of the girls uncle had had covid and she had been around him the entire time. My schools whole "saftey plan" is just to continue school normally and wear masks in the hallway. This situation might not have been much of a problem if I didn't have my 82 year old grandmother living me. I asked my friends who go to that school what they think about it. They all said I was over dramatic and that the virus was just like the flu with nothing to worry about. One even said that she wanted to get the virus so she wouldn't have to go to school. The only one who cared was my friend from band. The two of us are going to go to the public school now. Am I overreacting?
