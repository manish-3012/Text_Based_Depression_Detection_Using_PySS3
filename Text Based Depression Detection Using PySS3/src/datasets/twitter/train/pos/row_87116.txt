Help help help 15m 3 years ago I had a really good friendship with a guy, but since we didn't have classes together on our second year of friendship, and went to different high schools in our 3rd, the relationship kind of faded, and his texting is so dry, he always starts it with "hi" and if you don't reply in a few minutes/hours he'll keep texting, even call, and he would do it every single day. And when I do answer, I feel that all of the weight of the conversation is on me, it's on me to keep it going, so I started ignoring him more amd more since he had nothing to talk with me about, and then unfriended him. Today he texted my mom asking her about me, I told her to tell him that I'm asleep and I'll talk to him later, mom is pressuring me to reply to him, what lie can I say to not make myself look bad?
