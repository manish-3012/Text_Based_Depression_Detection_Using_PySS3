I've tried watching animated shows from my childhood. It was an interesting experiment Yes, that's what I'm doing when I have insomnia. I simply decided to try and watch them and I realized how much I've matured. I realized how many things cartoons taught me,  mostly to respect people of a different race, with different cultures, or simply, people who are different

Some of them are so educational. When I was a kid, I would find it weird that my parents or any other adult would watch something that it's meant for kids. But now, that I am aware of how few TV shows my parents watched in their childhood and now that I see how many interesting things they teach, I can understand why any adult would watch them. 

Or some of them are just entertaining. Some of them might even give you nostalgia. 

And you can even make memes out of them. 

Not gonna lie, sometimes the (3D)  animation looked gross but those cartoons still got a special place in my heart.

Also, my favorite Barbie movie is "Barbie Princess Charm School" :)
