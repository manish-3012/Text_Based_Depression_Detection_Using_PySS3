Sooo I am so so deeply disappointed I just found out that a teacher i had in middle school , whom I respected deeply and I really missed , one of the  people I considered a model , the person I aspired to be like when I will be an adult and the person who made me fall in love with history is a fricking racist who does not support BLM , a homophobie and a transphobe and supports Trump.  
I feel like my life is a lie rn :))
