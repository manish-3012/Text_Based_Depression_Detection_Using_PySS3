fucking hate my brain i will go on a rant here because if i tell this to people i know they might give me special treatment and that would just suck

ok my brain sucks. first of all, apparently i'm "gifted", which is actually a bunch of bullcrap and all it means is my parents homeschool me because i learn differently. this in turn means i am incredibly lonely and have no social skills/social anxiety (literally have a grand total of 1 real life friend who i still talk to lol)

also since i'm homeschooled it's really easy for me to lead an incredibly sedimentary lifestyle, so i'm fat and have extremely low self esteem lmao

i also have adhd which means i can't even do gifted things lol. i have to read 3 books over the summer and i haven't even finished one so far because my attention span is so shit. i just waste my day doing random shit and playing video games. i literally dont need to be gifted for anything i do. i mean it would be nice if i wanted to be a rocket scientist or something but i want to dj and produce music so i really don't need any of this. my attention span is also not long enough for me to put effort into becoming good at producing music

also i probably have some anger issues which has become really apparent lately because i keep getting mad at the most insignificant fucking things for no reason, and then i take it all out on my family and (online) friends. it sucks ass and im probably going to end up burning bridges with people because i keep bullying and harassing them. i know i need to control it but in the moment i just dont care.

also i have tourette's which isnt nearly as bad as the more extreme examples you see but it's still annoying

oh yeah and a mild sensory disorder that makes me have an incredibly hard fucking time eating certain things (that my family loves because we have them really oten and a lot of the time i eat like half my dinner lmao)

tl;dr my brain is full of a fuck ton of bullshit L
