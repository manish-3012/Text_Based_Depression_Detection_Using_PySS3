Iâ€™m at my grandparents and I hate it Iâ€™m stuck at my grandparents house and all they do is make me do work for them now their lawn build stuff for them rake the leaves paint theyâ€™re fence last time I was hear I had to build a fence out of metal piping around a 2 acre area for their friends. They just make me do work and whenever I try and listen to music or play a video game they get and and say they had it way harder when they where kids and all that itâ€™s so annoying being around them and they are so boring but whenever I say Iâ€™m bored or somthing they make me do chores I wish I could go home.
