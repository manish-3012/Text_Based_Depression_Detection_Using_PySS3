I dont like transgenders Or cisgenders 



I feel like if you identify as a female you should look d just call yourself a female and if you identify as a male, you should just call yourself a male. Theres really no reason to put these words imfront of your gender, all they do is divide people. That's just my opinion you can downvote me if you want.
