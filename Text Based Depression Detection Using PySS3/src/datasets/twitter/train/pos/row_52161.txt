Omg Iâ€™m anxious and stupid Freaking out right now because I promised myself that at my next check up I would tell the doctor about my constant panic attacks Iâ€™ve been getting basically all my life. My mom said earlier that she was gonna schedule a check up soon. Iâ€™ve never talked to her or the doctor about my problem and Iâ€™m really anxious about telling them. I think to myself â€œah whatâ€™s the worst that can happenâ€ but it doesnâ€™t calm me down. Idk what could happen. I guess Iâ€™m just scared that Iâ€™m making a big deal over nothing and maybe itâ€™s normal and Iâ€™m just a pussy. Jesus, opening up is stressful. Especially to people you never open up to.
