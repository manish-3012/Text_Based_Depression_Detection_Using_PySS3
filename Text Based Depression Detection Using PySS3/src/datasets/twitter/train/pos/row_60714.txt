The internet is in trouble(Not A Joke) Ok because of the whole 2020 things it makes it easy for some stuff to get through the government. So in Australia some big media companies are lobbying to be able to get their hands to the keys that control the YouTube algorithm. In other words companies would be able to force upon their own content and not allow anything in your recommendations. And this will not only effect Australia but the world. THIS IS THE INTERNET IF ANY COUNTRY desides to change the rules of the internet in their country it changes everything in the internet.
