I still think about this to this dayðŸ˜­ So when we were in school like when the winter break was coming 2020, there was this girl talking to some teachers about like drinking milk in a classroom. She wasnâ€™t in trouble but she was just playing around with the teachers. So when I got to my class I was supposed to be at I saw her switching classes standing in the doorway. She was so fucking pretty I couldnâ€™t stop staring at her. I donâ€™t know her name but sheâ€™s kinda popular and hung around with the popular kids. She caught me staring at her and we were just staring at each other. When I realized this i STILL couldnâ€™t stop staring. We then had to enter our classes and we broke eye contact and just moved on.

I hope when I go back to school I see her again.

and i also hope she doesn't remember that moment.
