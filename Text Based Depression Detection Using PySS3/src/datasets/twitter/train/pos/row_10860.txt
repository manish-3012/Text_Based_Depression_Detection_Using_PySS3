book idea Okay, so basically, I have an idea for a book, (TW: suicide) and I'd like feedback on the idea.
So the book starts off when a girl (15) wakes up in the hospital, and finds out that she survived her suicide attempt, and her best friend didn't (they had like a suicide pact type of thing.)
Then the story follows a series of events, centred around her family's life. 
Also, her brother (19) moves back in with their parents after having dropped out of uni.
The book will be in 4 parts, each taking place at the same time, and each from a different characters perspective. (mom, dad, girl, her brother)
Anywho, I'd like some feedback, so thanks.
