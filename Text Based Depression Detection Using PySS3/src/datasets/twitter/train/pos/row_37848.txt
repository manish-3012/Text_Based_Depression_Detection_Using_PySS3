Help me with expanding song lyrics Okay, I am in a group at school, and we have a project to make a song. I made 12 of 'em, and their favourite was "Scared of babies".

Lyrics (so far):
I am scared of babies
Go shit yourself
Somewhere else
Thanks!

So my question or yeah what I seek is help to make the song a full song, not just one verse. I'm already working on the instrument part, since I'm the only one who knows some music. So if you guys have anything to add I would appreciate it. And it's meant to be a funny song, so just go wild! And swearing is allowed!
