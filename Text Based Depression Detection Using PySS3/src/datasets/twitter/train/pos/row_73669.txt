1 + 1 = 11 Yes

need proof?

I can Prove

I need to start from Fundamental level to prove

what is 1 here?

1 here is a digit and number

1 digit here is the only digit in this base 1 number system that I created

1 number in my this number system is equal to 1 in common/Universal Base 10 Number System

&amp;#x200B;

|My Created base 1 Number system| Common/Universal Base 10 Number System|
|:-|:-|
|1|1|
|11|2|
|111|3|
|1111|4|
|11111|5|

&amp;#x200B;

My base 1 number System only supports Natural Numbers that is (in terms of common/Universal Base 10 Number System) 1,2,3,4,5,.......,âˆž

so lets get back proving the statement 1 + 1 = 11

now we can easily prove it by converting it to Common/Universal Base 10 Number System

1 + 1 = 11        =========       1 + 1 = 2

11 = 11            =========       2 = 2

Hence Proved
