Which Macbook Air Color should I get? Macbook Air 2020 (Intel i3 if you must know)

Gold or Silver

Silver seems too boring, everyone has a silver laptop. Gold (that really looks like Copper) looks cool but my sister says its too girly. Would it look weird in public?

Iâ€™m kinda indecisive so pls help.
Couldnâ€™t post links of pics cuz they got auto removed.
