I love r/teenagers thanks for your help everyone! Now playing always gonna give you up by r/teenagers

We're no strangers to love  
You don't know the rules so get banned  
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of  
You wouldn't get this from any other mod  


\[Pre-Chorus 1\]  
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling  
Gotta make you understand  


\[Chorus\]  
Always gonna give you up  
Always gonna let you down  
Always gonna run around and desert you  
I'm gonna make you cry  
Always gonna say goodbye  
Always gonna tell a lie and hurt you  


\[Verse 2\]  
I've banned you for so long  
Your heart's been aching but you're too pathetic to say it  
Inside we both know what's been going on  
I know your game and we're not gonna play it

Get it on Itunes, Spotify, and Google music thing idk TODAY!

Also don't do drugs kids
