Someone please, help. I just want to die. I really do. Got bullied in school, tolerated all of it, complained multiple times to the authorities, but hey, what am I even talking about? It's fine, the little kid won't be emotionally scarred in any way at all...

Tried my hand at sports, in turn got my knees hurt real bad, now I can never skate again in my life, or else it's the wheelchair for eternity.

Tried my level best at studies, and even scored good during graduation, but now college is just crashing down at me, and my parents yelling over me not getting good grades like I used to during school. They themselves said, and I quote:

"Just study hard now, after you get a good college, you will have a very easy and great life."

Plot twist: the stream I wanted to pick was not in the favor of my parents, had to pick Civil engineering instead of Aeronautical, cause, yknow, "gotta carry on the family business."

I also get "monthly pocket money", which I can't really spend, cause my parents forbid me to, even though I basically work like a slave in their home during this quarantine, washing dishes, sweeping floors, dusting rooms, sometimes doing laundry by hand, cleaning toilets, just because "I should be grateful to them."

I just-

No.

Life is not easy.

I'd rather take an easy way out.

Please, I ask help.

I really need someone to open up to, and at this point I'm desperate enough to open upto anyone.

Be it a cheer up line, or life advice, anything.

I don't want to get left like this.
