Life of a cowboy I'm on mobile so you know bad format

So I was a city kid for a good chunk of my.life. then me and my family moved out of town just far enough so we could own cattle and horses but still go to the same school. Now not to put anyone else down but my life is hard. Every weekend I have to drive a 4 hour round trip to go check cattle up in Wyoming. My dad takes this very seriously and yells way to much over small mistakes but you get used to it. The cows are cute but it's kinda sad knowing all of them will be killed for meat soon but that's the circle of life baby. It's hard work and a lot of yelling and running but it's fun. Thanks for listening to my rant.
