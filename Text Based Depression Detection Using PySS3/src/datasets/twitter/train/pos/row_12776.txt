Don't you think that it's cool knowing a language that no one else can speak? Zu'u learn dovah tinnvak fah two sul, wah learn daar sentence.

I learned  (alittle)the dragon for two day, to learn this sentence.  The sentence is a little shit, because the dovah language isn't complex enough to be used in "normal life" I wouldn't recommend trying to learn this hunk of junk language. It's a waste of your Saturday afternoon.
