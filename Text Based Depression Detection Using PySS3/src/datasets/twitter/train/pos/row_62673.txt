My friends and me. I am feeling super betrayed today, because my best friend doesn't make an effort in our friendship, but talks to my other friends a lot. And now that he got a girlfriend, he doesn't try to connect with me at all. I made the connection with him and my other friends and they only know each other because of me. I made the sonic rainboom and should be treated as a rainbow dash, but why am I now a secondary character such as Derpy Hooves (That was a My Little Pony reference)?  I talked with him about it and now he'll try to talk with me more, but I'm feeling like I'm a bother. I'm always there for my friends. I'm loyal, I'm kind when needed and I'm funny. But he doesn't show the same loyalty towards me? I'm not saying he shouldn't have any other friends, but I think he should at least treat me better, since he wouldn't even date his girlfriend if it wasn't for me.
