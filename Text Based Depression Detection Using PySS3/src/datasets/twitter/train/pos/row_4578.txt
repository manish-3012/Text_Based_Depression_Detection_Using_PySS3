Guys i would like to apologize for supposedly reposting a meme today I donâ€™t post memes for karma, i couldnâ€™t give less of a fuck about some online points system that doesnâ€™t matter or do anything. I post memes on Reddit to make people laugh after theyâ€™ve maybe had a bad day and just in general to make people laugh. I had no intention of stealing someoneâ€™s original post from Reddit. I originally found this meme on Youtube and thought i might as well share it to you guys and had zero intention of reposting and offending any of you.
