I played first piano concert last night!! I hear my name called, and I am instructed to walk out onto stage. I'm sing, quivering. As I walk out, I trip on some wires, so that was embarrassing. I get to the piano and bow, people clap, I sit down. 

The very first note I play. Is wrong.  

But then I correct myself, and now. I'm shaking so hard. I black out. Luckily it was all on camera, but in my head, I honestly remember nothing of the rest of the piece. But, according to the video, apart form the start, I nailed it ;)

Thanks
