I almost died hiking. (I don't where else to post this so it's going here)
So me and my youth group went on a hiking trip today and the leaders let us split off into our own groups. So me and my group went down a creek and saw a hill back up to the trail we were all pretty tired plus it was getting near time to leave so we started up the hill. We all got up to about 10 maybe 15 ft from the top and this was a big hill like easily 250 ft, so we get up close to the top and I got stuck. I couldn't grab anything because there were no roots or trees just a rock with a bunch of little like 1/4 inch ledges on it. I used the rock most of the way up but when I got to the end of the rock I started just using my hands and feet to dig into the loose dirt. But I got about two feet from the in the middle of the hill I started to slip there was nothing to grab I just dig my fingers in as hard as I could. I eventually slid down to a little rock that was mostly in the ground. I was able to get my footing on the rock and start back up the hill. But man did I have like 5 panic attacks on the slide down to the rock.
I didn't know where to put this story so figured here would be best
