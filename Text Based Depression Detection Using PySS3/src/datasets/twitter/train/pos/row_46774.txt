I hate when people say "I like all genres of music" Because no you fucking don't. Whenever I meet people like this, Iâ€™ll show them some death metal like Kataklysm or Vader and they'll hate it. Then Iâ€™ll show them some classic country like Merle Haggard or Hank Williams and they'll hate that as well. So stop saying you like all music genres when you don't.
