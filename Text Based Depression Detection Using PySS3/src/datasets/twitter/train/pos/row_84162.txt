I mean something to someone :) So Iâ€™ve always had problems with anxiety, and a huge fear of mine is being invisible or not meaning anything to anyone. Last night I was talking to a good friend of mine and I was expressing my worries and she sent me a couple voice messages of her assuring me that yes, Iâ€™ve helped her, she enjoys being my friend, and I mean something to her. 

Me, never hearing this before, start happy sobbing. She had said how she has considered doing the unalive, and I helped her out of it. 

Sorry, I just needed to rant somewhere, this seriously meant so much to me and I feel great about it. You know that video of K.Harris  calling Joe and saying like â€œWe did it Joe!â€? Thatâ€™s what I felt and it was crazy good. So yeah thanks for reading :)
