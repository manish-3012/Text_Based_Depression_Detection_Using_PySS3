Struggles of going to a fancy smart school pt 1. Yes, Iâ€™m doing multiple of theses because I need somewhere to get stuff off my back. My composition teacher, i love her and i hate her. 

Her stupid feedback on my essay doesnâ€™t make any sense. Sheâ€™ll under line something, make a comment, but i donâ€™t understand what sheâ€™s saying. 

I have a sentence saying â€œOâ€™Reilly uses pathos to stir up negative emotions with the audienceâ€ and underneath â€œstir up negative emotionsâ€ she put â€œpeopeâ€. She miss spelled people, sure, but what does she mean? What does the comment â€œpeopleâ€ mean?!

And a good portion of my feedback is WRITTEN ON TOP OF MY SENTENCES, SO I CANâ€™T EVEN SEE WHAT SHEâ€™S SAYING!! And, when I told her this is why Iâ€™m not done fixing my essay, she was like â€œGuys, we should be beyond not being able to read my handwritingâ€ LIKE BITCH DID YOU EVEN HEAR ME?

Also, we had to get our essay feedback a week later than her other classes, so while other kids got theirs on Friday, we got ours literally this Monday (itâ€™s Wednesday at the moment) and so a lot of kids werenâ€™t ready for class today because we didnâ€™t have time to fix our essays, since we only had one day, plus hours of other homework we had to do.

And because of this, she starts complaining about us doing it last minute, and how thatâ€™s messed up her whole schedule. AND WE ONLY HAD ONE DAY, PLUS HOURS OF HOMEWORK!! Itâ€™s just ridiculous!

And yes, I understand that she probably wasnâ€™t thinking about how late we got our stuff back, but itâ€™s still friggin frustrating. And i just had to suck it all in and put on my passive listening face because i donâ€™t wanna get in trouble for being pissed off. 

I swear to god this school is going to give me a heart attack from all of the stress i have to deal with.
