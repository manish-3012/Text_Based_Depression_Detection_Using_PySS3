Just realized, my mother is savage.... I always have been wishing for a dog and today I asked my mother that 'Should we get one?'
She smiled, looked at me and pointed towards me. 'Already have one. And one is enough'

Aaaaaaand I was badly trolled. She deserves respect so I gave her a dab. Savage...
