Memes are a form of art Art has existed in the world for centuries as a way of cultural and self expression. But recently, that meaning has been warped and changed, with prejudice growing in the art community. 

Back in say, medieval Europe, many artworks were based off real and relatable factors of life. Such as witch hunts, crop cycles and everyday life. And because this was relatable to the everyday person, the peasantry all the way up to Kings all enjoyed art. A form of cultural expression for society as a whole.

Nowadays the true meaning of art has been warped so much, that painting say, a person zoom calling a friend with a facemask by the computer on the desk would be seen as cringe and strange. The exact opposite of what art is meant to be.

If you google the definition of art you will find art is â€œthe expression or application of human creative skill and imaginationâ€. â€œA form of communicationâ€ and â€œan act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.â€. If u asked ur average zoomer and millennial, they would say memes do this than stereotypical â€œartâ€. Many popular memes are based on real world factors such as Corona-virus, relationships and school.

To summarise, true art is a form of cultural and personal expression that knows no bounds. Memes are also a form of cultural and personal expression. The r/memes description literally says â€œa form of cultural expressionâ€ proving that memes are a form of art.
