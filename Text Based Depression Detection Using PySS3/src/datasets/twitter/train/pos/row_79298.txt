When you get in a youtube argument with some latin americans And they freaking tell you that the US teaches their kids wrong because the continent model we use isn't the same as the Latin american one, and so then somehow that is wrong because somehow continent models aren't just opinions and it is totally wrong for another country to have a different worldview. Like I don't get it, you freaking tell me I was taught wrong because English speakers have a friggin different continent model and that is wrong because it isn't the same as in countries with different histories, languages, and people. It's stupid.
