The best thing covid lockdowns has made me do was quit smoking/vaping weed. From now on I'll only eat edibles or drink weed tea I've been smoking black market carts since sophomore year and eventually started buying only dispensary carts but I haven't smoked/vaped weed in almost 2 months because I was concerned about covid and wanted my lungs to be in good shape in case I get it.

Edibles/tea are the safest way to consume weed and lockdowns have made me so health conscious. I never thought I'd make the switch or stop vaping weed it was just too convenient, but definitely not the best thing you should be inhaling into your lungs
