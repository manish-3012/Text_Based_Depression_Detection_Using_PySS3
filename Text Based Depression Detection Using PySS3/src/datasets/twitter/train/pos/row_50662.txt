pls hear me out :( time to rant!!!

so like my really good guy friend and really good girl friend broke up, long story short it didn't end well. so the girl wanted to talk things out with him and tell him her perspective on why she broke up with him so things could end on good terms and we all share the same friend group and she didn't want it to affect it.

she texts him if they could meet up but he replies saying ill let you know by tonight. fast forward...he doesn't let her know and it's been a day and a half. 

my girl friend messages me saying how's she's so mad at him for him not replying and how he's so immature. i mean like....you did break up with him...im pretty sure he needs time to heal. i replied saying "give him some  time he will reply, and i mean things are over so like ofcourse he won't talk to you the same way he did before" 

she sends me a very petty message saying "he won't talk to me same way? If you wanna take his side go ahead."  when i was literally with her throughout her break up...I would stay up for her and I would go meet her when she was crying all night about him. 

i low-key feel hurt....like literally after all ive done to get you through this, you throw me under the bus like that. it sucks, and she starts complaining to me how no one is there for her...when everyone is.
