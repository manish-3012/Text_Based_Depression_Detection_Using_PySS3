i feel so numb in my relationship and donâ€™t really care about it anymore i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong. iâ€™ve just been let down a lot in the relationship so in a way of defending myself i just kind of let go... but now thatâ€™s kind of backfired because i genuinely donâ€™t really care about talking to him and making plans anymore. 

itâ€™s like i donâ€™t want to get hurt anymore but idk i still kind of want him to be my boyfriend? i donâ€™t even know if i still love him
