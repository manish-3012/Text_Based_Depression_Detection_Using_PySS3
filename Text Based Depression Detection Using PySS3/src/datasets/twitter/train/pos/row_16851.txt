Whatâ€™s the best part of your day? The best part of my day is when itâ€™s around 8:40-9:20pm and Iâ€™m watching YouTube and my cat comes up and cuddles with me. 

Sheâ€™s getting old now and is at least 10 years so itâ€™s always comforting to know she still loves me. I think Iâ€™m the favourite for cuddling as she comes to my sister at the wrong moment and my dad doesnâ€™t have time for cuddles. 

Yes Iâ€™m gonna call her kitty even though sheâ€™s a senior and got white hairs on her tail. I love my kitty. Sheâ€™s perfect.
