How do I practice self-love? I made a post last night admitting (for once) that I have low sef-esteem, and the comments said to practice self-love. How does one go about doing that?
Note: This is a serious question, I know itâ€™s pathetic, but Iâ€™m really grasping for anything to keep myself above the water at this point.
