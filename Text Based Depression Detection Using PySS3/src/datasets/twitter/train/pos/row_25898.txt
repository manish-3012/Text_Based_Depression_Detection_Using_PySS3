Anyone else punch themselves sometimes when frustrated/anxious/angry/overwhelmed? I do this a lot. Say I'm way overwhelmed by something, sometimes I'll end up punching myself in the stomache like 4 or 5 times, fall on the ground in my room, and get up a lot better. Does help to clear the head when your head's too full. It's the main reason I like it. Also get out excess energy.
