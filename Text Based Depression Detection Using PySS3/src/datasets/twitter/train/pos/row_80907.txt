It could happen!! here's an update to my previous post on the sub

So I decided to tell him my feelings and he said he thought about us being a thing before and it's definitely possible (he's in a weird place rn cause he just got out of a relationship a few weeks ago) 

I thought he was gonna shun me and block me on everything but he actually understands! I know I shouldn't celebrate now as he could say no and I'll just be a sad pile of meat but I could definitely happen!
