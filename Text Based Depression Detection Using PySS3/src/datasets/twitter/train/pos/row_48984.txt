I am going to say it I do not belive that fat acceptance is necessarily a good thing. Don't bully someone for their weight but don't encourage them to stay in an unhealthy state. It is definitely a delicate act but it has to be done.

Obesity is a big problem in many countries and shouldn't be supported.
