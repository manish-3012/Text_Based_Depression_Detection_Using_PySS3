Iâ€™m probably going to get downvoted all the way to the ninth circle of hell for this, but... I honestly donâ€™t think TikTok is all that bad? Yeah, the whole â€œgirls dancing for attentionâ€ and â€œpulling shitty pranks for likesâ€ is fucking horrendous. Thereâ€™s no but to that statement. I just also think that things like the art, the people just leaving videos to say that things are gonna her better, cosplay, and other parks of it are pretty okay. 

Iâ€™m in full agreement with the vast majority that users under 15 shouldnâ€™t be allowed to use it, Iâ€™m also in full agreement that most of the platform is toxic, and Iâ€™m in even more agreement that there needs to be more moderation. 

I might delete this in a few hours. I just felt the need to say that.
