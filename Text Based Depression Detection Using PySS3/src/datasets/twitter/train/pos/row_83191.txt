Ladies and mentlegen of the subreddit dedicated to teenagers, I am torn between two purchases for my Nintendo switch. Do I A) purchase Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered or B) purchase Minecraft.

Now, I already own Minecraft on several other platforms, including iOS( mobile/PE ) and have NFS on my Xbox, but I want both of them on my switch as itâ€™s mobile and feels better than my phone. Please help me decide as to which to get for my switch and why.
