Just because I don't want to date someone who is transgender that does not make me fucking transphobic. So apparently I found out about this whole "super straight" stuff which is incredibly dumb. Some of the people I know are saying stuff like your transphobic if you only want to date girls that were born girls, but im not. I have trans friends and i honestly don't give a shit that they are but, I just don't want to date them. There. Is. Nothing. Wrong. With. This. everyone has there own tastes in what they like which i firmly believe in, do whatever the fuck u want. So why cant I do what i want with my sexuality if I dont like a certain type of person, its not like im a fucking pedophile or some horrible shit like they are making it out to be.
