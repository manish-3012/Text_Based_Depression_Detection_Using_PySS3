My biggest achievement One time when I went to aurora,Illinois when I was like 8-9 I built a huge snowman, beating out my older sisters by a lot.

While they took 20 minutes gathering snow to build their medium-sized snowmen, it took me 5 minutes to make a handful of snow into a 20-pound boulder by rolling it on the floor.

After that I made the next 2, smaller balls then fucking annihilated that snowman by cutting it's head it half with a scissors throw.

Why yes I am incredibly gifted
