anyone else get stuck in their heads? like when im not doing anyrhing that needs my full focus or i get a bit anxious i just start zoning out and cant focus on anything. 

happens so much at work. i cant focus on anything so i make a bunch of mistakes and it also makes me quiet and awkward. idk i hate it
