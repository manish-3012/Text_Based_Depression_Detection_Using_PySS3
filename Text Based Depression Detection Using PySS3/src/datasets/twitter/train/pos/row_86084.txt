How do you ether get a school closed or fire a bunch of teachers and a principal At my school we recently had a principal change last year and no one liked what he was doing but we thought it was gonna get better but as Covid popped up itâ€™s only gotten worse he ignores students and staff who have advice or questions and the teachers at our school are worse and never get punished only promoted the first problem I had was my English teacher last year was spreading rumors about and me and laughing about my grades with random students and random people would make fun of me and even bully me for my grades cause of her I even did something I regret and she told anyone and everyone about it, my mom tried calling the school and as soon as my mom said what she want to talk about they responding with â€œweâ€™ll get back to you on thatâ€ they never did so my tried recalling and once again the same thing now itâ€™s this year and that teacher still walk the halls and does the same thing to other students I didnâ€™t even mention that, that teacher and her husband sexually assault students all the time and her husband was a kindergarten teacher and they want to hire him at our school. The next thing that happened to me was this year and is still happening I have Econ and our school only has one Econ teacher but too many people have Econ this year so he asked another teacher if she could take some periods the non Econ teacher said yes even though she failed Econ in college and knows nothing of the subject and hasnâ€™t taught seniors since 1960 so I ended up in her class and she doesnâ€™t give us a time on when things are due she doesnâ€™t teach us she just reads a script and when we ask questions her answer is always I donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve never taught this before she teaches every period differently and then proceeds to bully anyone with a bad grade when she never taught us in the first place, I thought it was just those two but my girlfriend came up to me crying today and told me what happened and all of her teachers are refusing to teach their classes cause â€œseniors are adults and shouldnâ€™t have to be taught how to do somethingâ€ and they donâ€™t let her ask questions ether and sheâ€™s more behind then me and they even thought she was doing too good in previous years and deleted 11 credits and she has a job and canâ€™t get anything done and her grades are dropping and so is everyone elseâ€™s Iâ€™m lost and I canâ€™t figure anything out on how to fix this so how to I fire the principal or close the school on my own cause my mother doesnâ€™t even care about me anymore and just keeps yelling at me to get my grades up and keep telling her they wonâ€™t let me and she says â€œdo it anywayâ€
