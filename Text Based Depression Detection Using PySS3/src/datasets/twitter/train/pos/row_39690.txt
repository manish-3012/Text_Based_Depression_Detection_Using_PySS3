Males. Increasing cum/sperm amount? Shooting vs dribbling? Other males.... Is there a way to increase how much sperm comes out when you have an orgasm? Besides no fapping for a while? 

Also, is there a way to be able to shoot cum farther or harder? For me usually only the first spurt shoots out and the rest just sort of flows out or dribbles or whatever onto my hand or into the towel. I know edging can help and I do that already when i have time. Anyone else wonder about this or have any ideas?
