When a girl kicks a guy in the balls hard to punish/hurt/humiliate/violate him as a male, how is this not sexual violence and humiliation? How is that not just as bad as a guy beating a girl into that kind of agony and groping her? When a girl does this to a guy, why should he not give her a hard punch in the fucking face once he can stand again?
