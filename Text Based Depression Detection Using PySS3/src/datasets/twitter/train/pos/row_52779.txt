17 never had a relationship im 17 in a couple months jr in hs. ive never had a relationship(gf), virgin, no first kiss, not even fucking hand holding lmao. not to sound douchey or cocky but i can def lose my vcard and first kiss if i really wanted to but should i? i want to save it for someone worth but alot of my friends didnt/dont and i feel like im missing out. is there even a point of saving it for a person? is there a difference? my friend was like â€œfirst times suck anyways so just do it so it will be better with the person you wantâ€. any advice?
