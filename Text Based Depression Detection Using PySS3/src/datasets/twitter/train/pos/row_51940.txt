Need you guyâ€™s opinion on something Iâ€™v gotten to the point recently where Iâ€™ve been seriously considering this. I have no idea if itâ€™s possible, but is becoming Asexual a thing? Iâ€™m currently a heterosexual guy. And idk, I just feel like not having the need and feelings to have a girlfriend, date and have sex would make my life so much easier and simpler. Just cutting this out of my life sounds like an amazing thing. Obviously, as I am rn, i do find a lot of cute girls, and am friends with a few girls. Iâ€™ve dated once a few years ago and told myself iâ€™d go look for a girlfriend once I reached college. But here I am, and you know... just being able to cut this temptation out of my life would be amazing. I could completely focus on friends and myself instead of always having this need. Iâ€™d like to hear you guyâ€™s opinion, girl or guy, idc. Iâ€™m a decent looking guy, charismatic, humble and other shit. But wouldnâ€™t it be way better to just be asexual and chill out with the boys till I die at 50? 

TDLR: Can I become asexual? Is it possible? I genuinely cannot be fucked and am just to lazy to date.
