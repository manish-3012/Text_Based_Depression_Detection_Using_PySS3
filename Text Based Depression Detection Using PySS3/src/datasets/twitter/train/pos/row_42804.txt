Are my friends fake? Honestly, Iâ€™m sick and tired of having to constantly make plans and they just reply â€œokayâ€. I donâ€™t know whether I should drop them or not. Honestly every time I go out with them, Iâ€™m the one making plans. Whenever they make plans among themselves, they never include me. I always feel so fucking left out. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Like I feel so lost, Iâ€™ve known them for over a year and not once have they invited me out with them.
