I just ragequitted playing a videogame by yelling for the first time ever and scared my little brother I was playing Left 4 Dead 2 Last Man Standing mode and I was on The Passing finale, I filled the generator to the max and then this dumb game decides to throw all the special infected in the world at me getting me cornered by a jockey that ended up killing me literally a second before reaching the car to escape. My brother came to my room worried thinking I was having a heart attack or something I yelled at him in the heath of the moment and now I feel bad :(
