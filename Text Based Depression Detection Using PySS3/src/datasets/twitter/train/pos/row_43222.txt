Hey so I think I have a crush on my best friend So Iâ€™m a girl, and sheâ€™s a girl, and Iâ€™ve been friends with her for three years

She is really nice, really kind and sweet, and is the type to just compliment you out of the blue 

She is so sweet and nice, but we donâ€™t talk often because of social anxiety and schoolwork taking a long time. Plus I have online school and she is in person. We sometimes play games together though when we have time.

While Iâ€™ve been dealing with my depression she was my light, always supporting me and saying she loved me(in a platonic sense). She really is the only thing that makes me truly happy.

I havenâ€™t felt attracted to anything or anyone, and Iâ€™d never had thoughts of gross things with her, thinking of that makes me feel sick. Weâ€™ve cuddled before but that was also platonically.

Maybe sheâ€™s just a really good friend but judging by posts here, it sounds like I like her. Is there some way I could confess?
