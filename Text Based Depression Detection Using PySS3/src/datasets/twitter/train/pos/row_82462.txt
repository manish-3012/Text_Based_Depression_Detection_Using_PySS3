This sub is starting to get dominated by complete pussies and karma whores. Fictitious stories or complaints about this sub are stupid and the fact people actually think making up stuff for attention is cool makes me extremely disappointed.

Another thing that disappoints me lately is the amount of people who are quick to call anyone a bigot or straight up throw a tantrum over jokes is silly too,Iâ€™ve noticed itâ€™s mostly the latter half of the 2000s kids that are like that.

This sub used to be different and so much better but now itâ€™s just the things mentioned above or agenda posts.

Donâ€™t turn this place into Twitter/Super Weenie Hit Jrs please....
