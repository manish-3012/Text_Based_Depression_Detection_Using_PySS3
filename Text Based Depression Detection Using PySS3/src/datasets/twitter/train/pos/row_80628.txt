Why do people care so much about international issues? I don't understand why people devote so much of their mind power caring about issues that have no effect on them, especially if it's a place they never heard of.  I mean maybe if it's a Country you used to live in, but even then you moved of away from there, so why should it still matter.  Unless the issue is something like "China invades all of Africa" or "A large market crash has occured in all of Europe"" then it really shouldn't matter.
