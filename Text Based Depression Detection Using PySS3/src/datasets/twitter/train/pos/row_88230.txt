My friend is going to kill himself soon and thereâ€™s nothing I can do When he was younger he was with this girl and they got pregnant. She drank alcohol and killed the baby and that was that. They did not everything together and were each otherâ€™s firsts. They were literally soulmates. They planned their whole futures out. They both grew up rough with lots of death in their life. A few months ago she killed herself. Today is her birthday. My friend says heâ€™s ready. I told him not to. I had people cal his mom and sheâ€™s keeping a close eye on him. I live too far away to drive there. I donâ€™t know his address so I canâ€™t call the police. Im not sure how to stop him from doing it because he has his mind made up. Iâ€™m gonna miss him.
