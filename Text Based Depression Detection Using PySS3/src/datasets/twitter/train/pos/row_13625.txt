Dear Fat Teens 17-19 Years Old... Hi, I'm Dante and I have been thinking of finding like-minded fat/chubby people to become friends. What I want to do with these people are, as a group of friends, save up money to buy/rent a house to live in and be ourselves. The goal of the house is to push each other to a better place in our minds, bodies, and souls, whether it be lossing weight or just going out more and eating a bit healthier more often. However that is not the only goal, the other is to make each other feel like we are free and in our natural habitat where we can wear anything we want. If you wanna be a nudist, wear a maid outfit, tackle someone in a pikachu costume in the house go ahead because I wouldn't mind it most of the time, and if you decided to join the house you wouldn't either. This is just gonna be a house of fat, nerdy, gaming friends having fun and bettering themselves.

*PS: This house isn't just a quick project, it is to build friendships, self love, and happiness from our late teens into our time to settle down and build a family. Also I said 17-19 most of the 17 year olds that see this should be turning 18 this year.*

*PPS: Ha I said ppðŸ˜‚. I would prefer for everyone to already live somewhat close together so no one has to move across the country*
