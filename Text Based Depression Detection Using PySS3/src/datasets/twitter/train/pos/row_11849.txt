You guys don't know the definition of pedophile Pedophile: " a person who is sexually attracted to children." children meaning prepubescent kids, so around 13 and below. 

What *most* of y'all are taking about when you talk about pedos are actually ephebophiles. "a person who is primarily attracted to late- or post-adolescents... Generally, this means teenagers between 15 and 19 years old". And this is actually a very normal thing. BUT don't get me wrong not defending creeps. It is disgusting to hear the stories of creeps on here trying to act on those feelings.
