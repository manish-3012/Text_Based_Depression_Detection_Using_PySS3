Reddit sub recommendations be like Hey I've seen you're active in teenagers, that must mean you're active in MyLittlePony. Oh you accidentally tapped on that sub? Too bad, you're so active there we're going to recommend you this totally relevant subreddit, /beans. And now that you didn't like it, it means you hate memes, so here's /memes for you, and since you've seen that one post about politics on the front page, we're going to give you a good sub about politics, /AmongUs!

Enjoy!
