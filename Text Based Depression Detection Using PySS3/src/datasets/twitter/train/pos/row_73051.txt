I don't know why people take pride in their nationality and gender like you didn't do anything about where you were born or what gender you belong to taking pride in the thing you didn't contribute is weird that's why I never understand national pride. and the more confusing thing is men's day and women's day like bruh. congratulation you have the same gender as these peoples.
