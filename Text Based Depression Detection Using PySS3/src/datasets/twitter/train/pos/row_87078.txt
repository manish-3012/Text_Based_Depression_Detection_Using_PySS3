Just wanted to let you guys know I'm dying tommorow I started to pre heat the oven for a late night snack and didn't check inside of it, turns out almost all the plastic items were in there like bowls,cups etc and they melted my mom is at work gets home around 11am and I'm probably going to die then. Good bye life
