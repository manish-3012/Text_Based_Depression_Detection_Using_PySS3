thereâ€™s really no point in living to see tomorrow huh just an objective observation... im being forced to move out, have no loved ones nor family, severe (yes, diagnosed) mental issues, no interests nor goals. i canâ€™t think of a singular place worth living, nor a career/hobby worth being alive for.. only death, i wish

nowhere else to talk, yes iâ€™ve tried paid professional help and meds my entire life. just.. :/ really zero point
