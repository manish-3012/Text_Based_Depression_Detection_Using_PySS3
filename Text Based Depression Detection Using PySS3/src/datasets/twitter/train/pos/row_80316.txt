if you guys have been in relationships and had pet names for your s/o what were they bubba was a classic for me but i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll use it again. i usually used personal pet names i used for just them. 

i made it clear i hated â€œbabeâ€ â€œsweetheartâ€ â€œhoneyâ€ and all the super cheesy typical stuff
