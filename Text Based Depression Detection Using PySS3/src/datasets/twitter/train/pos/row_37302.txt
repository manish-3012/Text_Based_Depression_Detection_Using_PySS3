My sister's don't like me wanting my nails to be painted cause that makes me stupid It's sooooo stupid. They are LITERALLY gay too. One pan other gay. I'm disgusted, I expected so much better from them. They're like every other stereotype, and want to enforce stereotypes on me, like you should be muscular and tall. Makes SOO godamn dysphoric. These just make me so uncomfortable because I don't even think myself as a cis person. They wan me to be like every other jock guy, muscular, strong, masculine, and etc. I hate these masculine traits. I won't lie, they do tell me how to be a better person, but I learned not of that on my own, or at least half. I'm so sick and tired of them calling me 'manly' and 'strong.' They expect me, to not be me. How am I supposed to 'be me' if they won't. I can't with my family. Mom's the same way too, but worse, made another post about her check it out to know all the deets about me and the stereotype-inforcing jerks.
