Just a dumb question about a girl Context: So this is a stupid problem I have about talking to a girl for which I need advice.
So there's that girl who I met at a party on saturday evening. I really liked her and almost got to the point of kissing her and having nice time together but my friend's mom had to pick us up before I could. After the party I talked to her by message pretty briefly and only talked about what happened with another friend of mine when I left. Ok and? Well now the stupid thing is that if I wanna go further and try to start a relationship I must talk to her by message cause we aren't in the same school and I don't have much time to pass by her school.

 QUESTION: So now, my idiot ass doesn't know what to send her as 1st message and what to talk about after. Any advice?

I know it's a dumb question but it would kinda help me. 

Thanks!
