Does anyone else have hirsutism? And how do you deal with it? For those who don't know, hirsutism is is a condition in women that results in excessive growth of dark or coarse hair in a male-like pattern â€” face, chest and back. With hirsutism, extra hair growth often arises from excess male hormones (androgens), primarily testosterone. Totally didn't copy that from google. 

Anyways idk i feel really insecure about it. I can't bring myself to wear shorts in public unless it's for sports and I have to and lately I've been wearing hoodies outside even though it's so hot now in my country. 

No one has really brought it up like in school or whatever but I'm just super self conscious about it. Like theres freaking hair everywhere on my arms, my legs, my face and there's a bit on my chest and I feel gross. None of the people I see in school and at home have it and ajksdhfkladjshksjf. I think it might be a genetic thing cos my younger sister has it too i think but idk I just hate myself a lot.
