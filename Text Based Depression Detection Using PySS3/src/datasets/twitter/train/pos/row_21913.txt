I couldnâ€™t post on r/art because of the strict laws, so Iâ€™m here to tell you about a sub me and my friend have, r/Notseriousart! r/Notseriousart is a subreddit that my friend made a while back. He does pixilart but when he posted it to some subreddits, he didnâ€™t feel comfortable posting to a sub with advanced artists who gave him constructive criticism. He decided to make the sub so people could just casually post art they made without any stupid rules. He made me a mod recently, and I took the role of promoting it so it isnâ€™t a dead sub! Any teen artists who arenâ€™t looking for anything super serious, this might be the sub for you! We need more people to post so we can have a successful sub.
