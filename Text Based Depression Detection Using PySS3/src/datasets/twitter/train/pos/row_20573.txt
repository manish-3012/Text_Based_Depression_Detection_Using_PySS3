If you are looking for a rts defence game I'd suggest they are billions It's a fun game where you need to build a base and army to defend and clear swarms of zombies.

The game is a bit clikbait because there aren't really billions but it's mostly because that would be impossible.

It has a great community we're you can create custom maps and campaigns.

A good sandbox mode and campaign that will challenge you no matter how good you are.

And there is a count on how many zombies the whole community killed.

Last time I checked it was 400 billion.

I'll be streaming it later today on twitch so ig follow me get stressed and scared on xDimitri1 on twitch
