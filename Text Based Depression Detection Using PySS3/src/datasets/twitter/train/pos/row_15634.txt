FEED MY GIRLFRIEND So i have a date this weekend and i want to cook for my girlfriend. Im going to the commissary (grocery store) this friday, and preparing it at the SRC (public kitchen, were stuck on base lol). Any advice as to what i should make? Im not the greatest cook but i want to make something special. We just met but i want to show her how much i like her, and how much effort im willing to put into the relationship. Recipes, suggestions, links, anything helps lol.
