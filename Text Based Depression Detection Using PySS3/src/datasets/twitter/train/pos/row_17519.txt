Please write asking for any advice, rant about anything, whether it be in comments or PMs, I will do my best to help you in the best way possible! Hi, I'm just a guy that looves helping others, hoping to get a career sometime in the future that may help other people.
I always believe the good in people, and I almost never jugde orhers due to this. Yes this has brought me hurt too, and has opened me up to abuse, but because I've had the chance to help some others, it has all been worth it!

Write about anything, asking for advice, maybe you just want to have someone to talk to, and I'll gladly listen!
I'm also open to any interesting facts, whether it be by something random or a hobby you have!

I'm a 16y old Danish male, but I usually hang out with people up to 22 years old due to my friend circle being a bit older than me, so I dont value by age or gender, in my regards we're all human.

I would be glad if I could just help one person with this :D
