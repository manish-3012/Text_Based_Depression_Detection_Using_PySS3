WOW, I do not like gaming I bought a Nintendo switch on March before quarantine and so on and I'm already bored of it..... I only bought one game with it tho (pokÃ©mon sword) but still I don't think I'll be excited about having other games. So I'mma sell it and buy me some good headphones. But the big question is: Â¿Beats or Bose?
