Classic girl won't reply on Snap Alright, the answer must be super obvious, but I'm not sure what to think what's going on, and every answer doesn't really satisfy me. I've thought about this for weeks. So, I've talked to this girl for 3 weeks straight until we started responding a few hours apart, which is fine, I can't talk every minute of the day, and it's gotten pretty dry. (I have observed that she started acting distant when she got evicted from her own childhood home, so um, it's probably that?) The thing is, she's really unpredictable and she'll seem interested one day and we'll have a long conversation and then I'm put on delivered for more than 10 hours the next. When I try to end the conversation she'll keep it going though, so ???? (And she'll do this in the day, but I still feel like I'm being used.) Then sometimes I'm left on delivered for 16 hours and yet her Snapscore goes up by like 20, and she's at home too, so she's obviously not busy or is too 'tired' or whatever to talk. We're going to meet after quarantine which might hopefully change things and clear the air, but I still want your guys' thoughts. I kinda want to block her because I have lost some interest in her, except I don't really know what to expect, I don't like her responding 3 minutes later to my Snaps anymore. And yeah, I miiiiiiiiiiight've met her because  I added everyone on quickadd in a daze. And she miiiiiiiiight go Sicko Mode 4 times a week.
