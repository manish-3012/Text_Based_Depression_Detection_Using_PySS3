Better Education I want a better education. The current school system is inadequate and outdated. It has brought many of us pain, stress, and sleepless nights. I'm tired if it, I want to bring together people and fight for a change to this crappy system. 

I don't need to explain why.

There are hundreds of posts on this subreddit alone talking about how horrible the current system is.
Not one post praising it. 

My fight starts today, does yours?
