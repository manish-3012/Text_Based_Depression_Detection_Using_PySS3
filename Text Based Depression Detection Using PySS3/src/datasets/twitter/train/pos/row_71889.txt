A little something, from Jerry! Why do people on r/teenagers act like it's the end of the world just because their phone got taken away. Grow up! I still don't have a phone.

And to those people that say that their life is hard. 

Let me ask you a question.

Would you rather be in the working in the coal mines or be in school for a few hours.

People that say school is hard, usually have intermediate classes. 

Meanwhile, I'm taking advanced courses and not complaining.

People, start putting you mind on the ball.

Don't look at the field, keep your eye on the ball.

If a 13 y/o can do it, you can do it!
