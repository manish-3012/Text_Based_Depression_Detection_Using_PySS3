i want your opinion ok let me set a scene. hereâ€™s some things that these people have done, tell me what you think. (characters are A and E)

-i have mentioned to both of them that theyâ€™re dating, and neither have corrected me
&gt;-A has told me that E kissed them before

-A has mentioned them doing, quote, â€œsome gay shitâ€ at Es house (that was where A said that E kissed them)

does it sound like theyâ€™re dating? like, would you think they were dating if you had this evidence? iâ€™m not crazy, right?
