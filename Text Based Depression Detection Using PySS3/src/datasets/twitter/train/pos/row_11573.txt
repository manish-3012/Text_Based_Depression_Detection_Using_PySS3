Minecraft switching to Microsoft Aight new Minecraft thing and Iâ€™m pretty pissed about it. To start off:

Iâ€™m on mobile so typing requires 3 extra brain cells I donâ€™t have 

It could be very well that the new switch will keep java the same, but as a guy that plays both java and bedrock, Iâ€™m not too sure about it. It could be true that this will better bedrock, but my motto is â€œexpect the worstâ€ because, hey, itâ€™s 2020. So Iâ€™m thinking this will worsen java. 

Now, probably the worst reason I donâ€™t like it is that my friend has java but doesnâ€™t have a Microsoft account, so he has to make one to play, which sounds fine, easily remedied, except his parents are pretty strict so yeah. 

And the second/last reason Iâ€™ll talk about is the pvp. I play skywars on both, and the pvp is completely different. Between bedrock pvp, 1.8 pvp, and 1.9 pvp, bedrock is the absolute STUPIDEST. Thereâ€™s no knockback, and thatâ€™s pretty much the only reason, but itâ€™s major, especially with skywars. Also, 1.9 pvpers, thereâ€™s no cooldown. So whatever java version you play on, there will be adjustments. 

But hey, maybe Iâ€™m stupid and things wonâ€™t change. Idk
