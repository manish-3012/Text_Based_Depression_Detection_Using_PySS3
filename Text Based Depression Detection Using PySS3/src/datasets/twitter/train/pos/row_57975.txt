My sister just destroyed my xbox Fucking toddlers man, first she destroys my phone then she damages my xbox it's like she's designed to fuck with my shit 3 years ago I finally got my xbox 360 my first console my dad spent upwards of $500 E.C(my  home country currency) I've always wanted the xbox 360 as my first console cause it was my first experience with consoles and I fell in love with it I've always took good care of it and loved it to death I even built an emotional connection with it cause it was my first console it feels like a punch to gut with brass knuckles. The worst part is she has her own tablet but always wants to watch T.V on the xbox but as soon as the xbox broke she just started using her tablet like nothing happened FUCK MAN THIS SHIT SUCKS
