Hey Texas teens! Hello Texas teens, If yâ€™all have noticed the events of the past week most Texas countyâ€™s have been low on water. You may be wondering why there isnâ€™t much water coming out of my faucet and why are showers so weak. Well if you ever need to shower I managed to research the best times to shower since water pressure is low during the day. The times when the water pressure is normal again is from midnight up to 7:30 AM so the best time to do showers during this winter storm would be from 4:30 AM to 6:30 AM for the best shower experience. Also the reason the pressure is so low is because of the fact that pipe bursts increase the water leak rate which for example increased Killeenâ€™s daily water usage from 2 million gallons a day to 9 million. Also the cities canâ€™t keep up with the water supply
