Does anyone here know what the requirements are for getting a job in photography Photography is my hobby and itâ€™s something that I take a lot of joy and pleasure in doing, so a job in photography is definitely a career Iâ€™d like to pursue once I become of age. What Iâ€™m not sure of is what the requirements are, also what most employers would pay per hour. If anyone knows Iâ€™d really appreciate it.
