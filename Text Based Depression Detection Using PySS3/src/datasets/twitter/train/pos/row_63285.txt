Can somebody explain this? I've been talking with a girl since the start of October. We where basically dating for these 2 months and we even expressed our feelings towards each other. However she has been acting strange in the second half of November and even stranger in the start of December. Let me clarify a little bit.
 
 We live in Patras, Greece and in around the 7th of November, the second lockdown began that is still ongoing. We went out on an last date before the quarantine began and things were excellent. We promised each other to go out after the quarantine ended and ever since then we haven't seen each other. However ever since the quarantine began, she has been acting strange. Very late replies on my messages, ranging from 1 hour to a whole day with answers like "yes" and "ok". This attitude was very new to me as before she would reply instantly. 

Nonetheless the worst thing came in the start of December. Basically her brother is a friend and a colleague of mine and I made a meme of him in the group chat we have with some of my friends. We create memes 2with our pictures all the time but he seemed to be offended with that and basically cut off any communication with us. Now the weird thing is that his sister, who is my crush, has also cut off any communication with me. I called her the day before yesterday and she hung up on me. And the weirdest thing is that she deleted messages that were 2 weeks old. Like I'm serious, she did not block me (although she did unfollow me on instagram but I dont care about that) but instead deleted some messages. 

Now I'm left here wondering what happened and if her brother had something to do about it. Does anyone have any idea why she might have deleted her messages that she sent me?
