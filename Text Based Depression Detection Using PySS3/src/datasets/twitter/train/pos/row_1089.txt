Writing something positive about my day, day #370 Iâ€™m at boarding school rn, so I went to the on campus cafe with a couple friends (itâ€™s a closed bubble so itâ€™s pretty covid safe). Also one of my friends Commissioned me to crochet a fox for her and I finished it and gave it to her today, she was so happy when I gave it to her and it was honestly the best feeling that someone loved something made so much.
