Do all parents have victim complexes? They sit their like u know I my day we and to walk down to our friends houses and ask them to go out, we actually spoke to people. I mean yes hitch just because I can phone my friend and play with them online doesn't mean I do nothing with my life or that I will go nowhere. It's not my fault ur fifty year old self had to walk somewhere forty old years ago, times have changed

Plus with Corona just now u would expect my parents to enjoy me being responsible and not going out and spreading it but nope! All the do is complain!!!
