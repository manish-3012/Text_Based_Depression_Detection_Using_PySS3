High School Iâ€™m going to high school next year and application time is going on now but Iâ€™m not sure if I wanna try going for a private school because I wanna try applying for a scholarship and financial aid but that takes money and also to do a high school entrance exam. I donâ€™t even have a lot to put on a high school â€œresumeâ€ like tops 5 things and thatâ€™s not enough to beat the competition or even apply for a scholarship. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
