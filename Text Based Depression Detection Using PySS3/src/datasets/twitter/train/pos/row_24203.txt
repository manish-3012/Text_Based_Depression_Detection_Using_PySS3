Giving out random facts daily coz i am bored. Day#30  Europeans were scared of eating tomatoes when they were introduced

 Scholars think HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s brought the seeds in 1519  with the intent of the fruits being used ornamentally in gardens. By  the 1700s, aristocrats started eating tomatoes, but they were convinced  the fruits were poison because people would die after eating them. In  reality, the acidity from the tomatoes brought out lead in their pewter  plates, so theyâ€™d died of lead poisoning.
