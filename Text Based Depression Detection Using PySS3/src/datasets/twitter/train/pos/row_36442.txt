Challenge accepted So today when me and my friends were walking one of my friends was like lets see who has more followers on instagram. So as predicted he won, but then the other one was like lets check who has more followers who are girls. Just to tell you guys no one on my instagram has seen my face, while everyone can see both of my friends. I only post art, and in my boi i also sail he/him. Most of the people following me know me, same for them. Guess who won, me somehow most of my followers are girls, while he only has like 2, i donâ€™t have many followers either, like 200 while both of them have like 800. So about 180 of them were girls for me. So my jealous friend was like â€œI bet you canâ€™t talk to this girl who I had talked for 3 weeks before I was rejected, and you canâ€™t even talk to her normally for 1 dayâ€ so i was like what I become friends with her because I donâ€™t want to date anyone yet. And talk to her for 4+ weeks. So now I get $50 if I can talk to a girl for over 4 weeks. Btw this girl is one of the hottest girls at my school.
