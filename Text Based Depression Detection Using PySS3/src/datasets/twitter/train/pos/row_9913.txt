First break up looking for advice *** on mobile sorry for shit formatting

Hey so my bf (16m) and I (15f) just broke up, I expected it and was thinking about it, and both of our romantic feelings were faded but we still like each other as a person and Iâ€™m good friends with all his friends and weâ€™re all in a discord server together. I havenâ€™t cried and Iâ€™m not sad enough to be sitting in bed in pjs eating ice cream (idk I guess itâ€™s a stereotype not sure).

Just looking for people to give me advice on what I should do or how I should handle it. Thanks!
