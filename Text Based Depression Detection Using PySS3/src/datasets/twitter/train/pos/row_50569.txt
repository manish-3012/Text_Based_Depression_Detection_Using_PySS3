I hate myself. I did so many things wrong... I am a failure... 

I hate myself, and I have been hating on myself for my entire life for good reasons. 

I did countless things wrong and countless times, I failed school, I failed to be a good person...

I am a bad selfish person, and I obviously have a lot of people who hate me and so should you!

Please downvote this post, I want to lose karma, I don't deserve it.
