Is it normal that I couldn't care less if I or anyone that is close to me died? I am really unhappy except for the occasional conversation I have with a friend where I'll vent out everything. I've gotten to the point that everything's indifferent to me. The other day my brother was scared cuz he thought he had seen a person staring at our house in the middle of the night for quite some while and I told him that worst case scenario he was killed so what is there to worry ab? He looked at me surprised and just left. So is it normal?
