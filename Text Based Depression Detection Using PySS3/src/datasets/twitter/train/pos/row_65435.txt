Idk how to say this (TW: TALK OF SUICIDE, SELF HARM, AND EDâ€™s) 
Ok so I donâ€™t want it to seem like Iâ€™m complaining about my life, I know people have it much worse than I do. I know no one asked, but I really just wanted to get some stuff off my chest. 

ALSO, Ik what Iâ€™m writing may be kind of worrying or something, but please dw Iâ€™m aight, just gotta rant. 

Before I get into it hereâ€™s a short backstory: I moved from the US to a country Iâ€™d never been to before when I was thirteen, after living in the same neighborhood for my entire life. I had an eating disorder and problems with self harm, which worsened after I moved. I had a string of useless therapists that did nothing or made stuff worse. Also, right after I moved I got into a toxic relationship with this edgelord type dude. I really didnâ€™t love him, I was just dating him because I thought I needed to â€œfixâ€ my sexuality (dumb, I know). Then around a year ago my dad moved out and my parents separated. He was cheating on her with his coworker, and refused to pay child support for a couple of months after he left. It was my job to ask him for the money. My mom, my brother, and I moved again due to safety issues in the middle of sophomore year. I relapsed into my Ed a couple of times throughout this. I havenâ€™t self harmed in over a year. 

Ok! thereâ€™s the brief backstory of the darkest moments for my life

Now onto current shit: recently Iâ€™ve been getting really sad out of no where. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because I need to process or something. I donâ€™t want to sound edgy but I literally donâ€™t see the point anymore. Like Iâ€™m just going through the motions every day, trying to seem positive and upbeat, but I honestly couldnâ€™t care less. I try hard in school, I eat normally, I exercise regularly, all to made my mom happy. I donâ€™t talk about whatâ€™s bothering me because I donâ€™t want to drive people away, so I make myself seem happy. The only thing I do that makes me somewhat happy now is art, but even that is getting harder and harder to keep up. Sometimes I really wish I didnâ€™t have to try so hard anymore. I really wish I could just die, and I definitely would if it wouldnâ€™t make my friends and family sad. Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking they wouldnâ€™t care anyways though.
