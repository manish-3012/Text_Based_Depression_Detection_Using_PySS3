School is a waste of time for me I spent the entire summer programming. And when I start a project I would stay as long as It's done or when I really have to go to sleep. Once I spent the entire night programming. It was from like 11pm to 9am. Maybe I'm insane but today was my first day at school. I woke up at 7am went to school and came back home at like 4pm. I didn't do much today. I spent only 4 hours learning something new. I wish I could drop out from school and get a job. I need to find more time
