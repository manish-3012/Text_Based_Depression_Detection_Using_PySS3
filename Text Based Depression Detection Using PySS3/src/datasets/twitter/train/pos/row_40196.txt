hello fellow teenagers and pedophiles i would like to make a complaint about the giver of birth of me and no one else known as my mother

sheâ€™s forcing me to not wear the device known in the public as â€œheadphonesâ€ during online classes since she thinks that i am not actually listening, this in most cases is untrue however there have been several secret occasions where i have in fact left a lesson early to talk to friends but this is none of her business and this was usually during classes i  really donâ€™t need to attend.

this isnâ€™t some big drama thing but i just wanted to be informed if any other members of this community have experienced this.

sorry for the pretentious words i was bored
