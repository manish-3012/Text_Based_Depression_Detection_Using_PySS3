Fitness goals Most people have a goal of "Lose this much weight in this much time" which is cool and all, but, I have had my own way of keeping a fitness goal. It's kind of vague but understandable at the same time.

Basically, my goal is that I want to be able to stand up on my own two feet no matter how old I get or how brittle my bones get, I wanna be able to walk and run and have a lot of energy even if I'm a hundred years old. Is this a good goal?
