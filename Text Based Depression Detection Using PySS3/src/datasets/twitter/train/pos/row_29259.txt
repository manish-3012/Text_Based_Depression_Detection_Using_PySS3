There's this one girl who's showing me affection and it's one of he only things that's keeping me going She's basically the only person who replies to my stories, she's also the only person that texts me daily. We like to joke around and stuff, I edited an animated video related to an inside joke we have and she told me I have really good skills and I'm super underrated which made me feel really good. Her sense of humor matches up almost perfectly with mine and she says every time we text I never fail to make her laugh. Today she told me that sometimes she scrolls through our texts when she needs entertainment or laughs and it made me feel really good.

She doesn't know it but she's probably the only real friend I have who actually cares about me and it helps motivate me every day.

Before y'all say anything, she has a bf so that's that. I think I kinda had feelings for her at the beginning of seventh grade (about a year ago) and idk if I still have feelings for her cus I haven't seen her irl since like march and it's hard to tell feelings over text but I think I might. She's dating this aggressive homophobic asshole which I don't know very well but over the texts I've had with him I don't think I like him very much. I don't wanna say anything cus she's my friend and I don't wanna get in between her relationships since it's none of my business also I'm afraid her bf will kick my ass since he's already threatened to fight me for absolutely no reason and to "hmu if u wanna draw blood" ok buddy but I'm not exactly the athletic type.

But yeah, idk just something I felt like sharing.
