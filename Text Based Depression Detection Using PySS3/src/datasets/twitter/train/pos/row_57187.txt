I did a thing again. Please read. Or don't. I'm just sad I'm sad. It's what I'm known for. It's what people see first when they look at me. When they observe. I don't hide it. There's no point. My energy drains forever. A faulty pipe. Covered in rust, so fragile that I could shatter at the slightest touch. Nothing helps me. I run circles around the therapists and psychiatrists. They can't help me. I know all the tricks, all the lies. Therapy is deceit, and I refuse to be turned into a snowflake who supports anything they see. I don't care about the riots. I don't care about the virus. I don't care about the Karen's. I don't have the energy. I just sit and watch from afar. Barely there, with no visible emotion on my face. I overthink. I refuse to trust. I know that nothing ends well. I know that I can't hold on to the things that I grab at as I fall, ever so quickly, towards my inevitable end. I'm not a fool. I can see straight through people, straight through their lies. It's not new. I've seen it all before. I'm so desensitized to everything. I can watch a child be taken from a mother by death's grasp at a moment's notice, and not feel a thing. I release no tears. I feel no sorrow. I can watch my childhood heroes fall victim to the most horrible ways to go, and not even blink. I don't see the point. In anything. I carry everybody's burdens. I strip them of their guilt and I hold it. I know what I'm doing to myself. It doesn't matter. You can't help me. You can't even hurt me. Please try, it'd be nice to know that my emotions still function as they once did, when I was a child.
