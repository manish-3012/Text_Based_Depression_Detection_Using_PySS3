It's funny when you know someone is trying to catfish you They'll send photos of themselves that look absolutely like modelling photos and expect you to fall head over heels for them. It's kind of sad, to be fair.

Right now some guy is trying to say he's this guy who legitimately looks like a model but when I asked for a proper snap he said, "My phone's camera is broken, but I have some saved photos."

Yeah, sure. The photos aren't even of the same person. Later he deleted the photos and he goes on to say that he lives in the same suburb as me. 

I have decided to toy with him seeming as it's the only thing left to do. 

Imagine if he wasn't catfishing me and I'm just paranoid. I'll take my chances.
