Thank you Daddy **The meltdowns and emotional outbursts** are the grips of my inferior function Extraverted Sensing. When Ni-dominants (INxJ) are stressed, they engage in impulsive sensory behaviour. The tantrums are also a symptom of PTSD.

**The fascination with murder, child sexual abuse, school shootings, drugs, BDSM, satanism and other morbid stuff** is a sign of high intelligence and insatiable curiosity, not a sign of immaturity and vulnerability. Daddy, you shouldnâ€™t snatch the internet off me because of my browsing history. That only makes things worse. Daddy, you should have sent me to a professional. Young people who suffered abuse are likely to have rather mature interests for their age.

**The depression** is all caused by YOU, Daddy. You sheltered me. You installed parental controls on my phone and took it away from me permanently when I deleted them. You denied me the things I love like video games and horror books. You wouldnâ€™t let me out unchaperoned. Thank you Daddy for making me severely depressed!

THANK YOU DADDY!
