[Advice plz] How do you deal with being constantly rejected? I have been asking out girls for about 2 years now (male btw), and I havenâ€™t been on one date. Every girl says that they donâ€™t want to date, or says they are gonna find a time, wait a month, and then say that they never really wanted to date in the first place. Iâ€™m honestly just thinking of giving up trying to date, but this saddens me. I see all of my friends getting girlfriends first try, and then I am still lonely. So how do you move on? How do you find the will to keep trying?

Iâ€™m in no way the most attractive person. But I feel that I at least have a good personality, and I only have asked out girls after I gain a good connection with them - meaning that I donâ€™t just ask out every girl in sight.
