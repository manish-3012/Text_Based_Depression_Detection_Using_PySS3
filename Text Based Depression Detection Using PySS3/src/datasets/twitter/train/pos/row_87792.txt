I think my son is a sorcerer. Hello r/teenagers. I have a serious problem. My son who is 14 about to turn 15 may be a sorcerer and I'm debating whether to seek help for him or not. Just last week our daughter unfortunately went missing, my boy was babysitting her while I ran to mcdonalds because he got a A on his Geometry test (I'm so proud of him) I got his favorite, Big Mac with no cheese or onion. When I got home I heard screaming coming from the kitchen. I rushed in and unfortunately forgot the Micky D's in the car. The kitchen smelled like Sulfur and the tiles on the floor where my daughter was playing on her phone looked burnt, I look up and see my son floating in the air. "How quaint." I blurted out, he then descended to the floor then saw I forgot he Mcdonalds. In a fit of rage he hurled a stake knife at me with his telekinetic powers. I'm currently in the hospital typing this and my wife is considering divorcing me because I left my 5 year old daughter and adolescent son at home. What the heck should I do?!?!
