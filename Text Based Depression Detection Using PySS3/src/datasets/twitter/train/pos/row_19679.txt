#Mental Health

Not stonks

Been getting worse lately, and is going in an entirely new direction, so I am unfamiliar with how I am. I keep being told really dark secrets and they have been dragging me into the darkness. I can be very open about my problems, and that does help when I get it off my chest. The problem is that many of the worst things on my chest are others' secrets, meaning I can't tell anyone nor get it off my chest. It's really painful.

#Things I Do

- Discord

â€” Program discord bots using js

[This is a link to my profile on top.gg if you want to see my 2 public bots](https://top.gg/user/663912704188219403)

â€” Run a server and moderate in a bunch

I own a server designed for teens from around the world, so that's fun. Lately people just aren't joining anymore. So slow.

- Poetry

I write quite a bit of poetry. I'll show one cause why not?

```The Walls I Paint:
The walls of reality are liquid.
They were frozen by the darkness around.
The truth behind it is quite twisted.
The thin ice had shattered and I had drowned.

Numbness, dumbness, I just can't run from this.
I layer the walls in lead paint to hide,
But they crumble and let in the sickness.
Shall I walk out onto the other side?

The light blinds me, but I can feel again!
Ignorant from the shadows that may lurk,
I sense a great power and I transcend.
I stay in the clouds making great artwork.

I fall asleep and the darkness appears.
Stabbed in the heart, I fall back to my fears.```
