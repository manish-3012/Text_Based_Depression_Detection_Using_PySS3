The wildest shit happened at school today So because of this whole Coronavirus and that we learnt that a Year 7 caught Covid and apparantly 50 other Year 7s needed to be sent home. We learnt this during lunch, so people were kind of nervous. Then the teachers started calling out names of the people in OUR year who had been in contact, and they got asked to go home. Now everybody's running around the lunch hall, screaming "AAH THERE'S FUCKING COVID IN THIS HALL", even after the teacher told everybody to calm down and sit down. There were kids screaming "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE", "WHAT IF I HAVE IT" and an array of swear words that will get me banned from this subreddit.

TL;DR: Year 7 caught Covid, lunch hall was in panic, Jesus it was a day.
