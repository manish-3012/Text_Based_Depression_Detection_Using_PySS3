My classmates are idiots I'm the only smart person in my class and I'm gonna be a complete dick about it because they deserve it those underdeveloped empty saltshakers. Before you say "Wow, this kid thinks he's smart", there's nothing wrong with knowing you're smart, but it fucking sucks that you're the only one, and everyone is trying to copy you. Sure, the highest form of flattery is imitation but this feels like an insult; just be smart yourself dammit! This class is full of weebs, feminazis and a liberal warrior, as well as the idiot sports kids that can't answer a fucking question.
