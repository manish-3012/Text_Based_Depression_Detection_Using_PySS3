I hate birthdays Woah, that time of the year is coming once again. I'll soon be 17, so everyone must be falsely nice to me. I can't stand that awkward small talk when someone I haven't talked with in ages calls to say happy birthday. I mean, I appreciate the concern, but it's still horrible. I just want people to treat me like it's any other day. Thank you for listening.
