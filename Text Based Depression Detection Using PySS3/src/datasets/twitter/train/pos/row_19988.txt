Just found out one of my closest online friends lives really close to me We've talked a heck of a lot, and we bonded over the fact that we had Arab parents. 

So, randomly, I mention my time and she goes "Oh, yeah, its the same for me too." 

Then we both freeze. I ask where she's from and she names my country. I panic and ask where and she names somewhere thats like HALF AN HOUR away. 

Currently, we're both coming up with stories so we can meet in real life and our parents think we're school friends. 

Don't worry. We've talked a lot. I know who she is. We're meeting in a public place too.
