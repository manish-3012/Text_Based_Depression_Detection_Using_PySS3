I hate school Honestly we probably all do but here are my reasons. 
1. They give us too much work. I literally had a theatre assignment once that was due by the end of the week that made you watch the 2 1/2 hour elf the musical movie and answer questions. There were so many questions and some asked to compare it to the original will ferrell elf movie. So than you have to watch the original elf movie and the musical. So that's like 5 hours of work just for one class. 
2. I don't have any freedom. I'm a male who likes my hair kinda long. Nothing below shoulders but it's longer than my ears which apparently makes all the difference. The teachers get on my ass and ask me to cut my hair just cause it's longer than my ears. It's like how can girls have hair as long as they want but not boys. And apparently dying your hair is too much of a distraction. I had my hair dyed blue once and all the teachers were mad about it. AND THEN THE GIRLS HAVE THEIR HARE DYED BLUE AND THE TEACHERS DONT CARE! It's the stupidest thing.
3. My teachers are too political. Once my theatre teacher made fun of biden for having a stutter. And some of the teachers are talking to the kids about how masks don't work. And some teachers have there masks below their nose. Like your supposed to be setting a good example not getting us killed. 
I could name so many more reasons but thank you for letting me vent.
