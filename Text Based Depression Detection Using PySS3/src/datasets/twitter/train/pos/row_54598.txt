How long should I wait to start up a convo? In my previous post I was asking how to get a cute girls snap, I got it but idk when I should start talking to her over snap. We donâ€™t go to the same school so we canâ€™t see each other irl rn and we technically just met. We are snapping back and forth but should I wait a bit before I start talking to her? If so, how long should I wait?
