As much as I hate to say this but It should be mandatory to post evidence of your loved one passing away if you are sharing it on this sub. If you are fine with everyone knowing about the death of your loved one, it should be fine with posting some sort of evidence because it sucks when the person gets downvoted to oblivion in the comments for being skeptical about it, he/she has the right to be skeptical and shouldn't be downvoted. This goes to other stuff like "my so and so cheated on me", "my parents did xxxxx to me".
Hopefully this didn't sound mean, if it did, it wasn't my intention to do so
