My grandmas favorite line Iâ€™m ashamed to be your grandmother. Your parents didnâ€™t beat you enough. 

First of all, nobody in my house likes her, sheâ€™s rude and mean. My mom works her ass off to pay for all my grandmothers medicine and when my mother almost died last year she gave my mother a letter. It wasnâ€™t an I love you and thank you for taking care of me, instead it was to pester her about a scam payment. Like seriously wtf. What mother does that to her child who is sick in the hospital? If anyone should be ashamed it should be me to have a Karen as a grandmother.
