I feel sad on Christmas now Idk why Iâ€™m feeling sad. Itâ€™s probably because I didnâ€™t get anything because I didnâ€™t ask, I feel like Iâ€™m a loser during this day.  A day when everybodyâ€™s supposed to have fun, Iâ€™m not having any fun because I havenâ€™t achieved anything significant in my life. Iâ€™m trying everyday but Iâ€™m not, in fact I havenâ€™t even tried. I promised to do some things today, but I didnâ€™t and instead played video games and watched YouTube as usual. Why canâ€™t I learn? I just want to learn! I only did some Prepscholar, but still...I couldâ€™ve done more. Iâ€™m weak as usual. I just wanted to become something but I honestly gave up on life, so Iâ€™m just putting aside my dreams of game development and art/animation. I hate Christmas, I just wish I had fun on this day. Iâ€™m not Christian, but still I wanted to be surprised or something on this day. Idk why Iâ€™m not having fun, Iâ€™m being a lazy, skinny, and ugly loser on this day. Iâ€™m not even trying anymore, I just do what Iâ€™m told to do or else Iâ€™ll get in trouble in school. I just canâ€™t even do anything. I cant work on my ACT practice, my SAT practice, not even read my AP Human Geography book. Sorry, Iâ€™m going to fail my AP Human Geography exams and my ACT/SAT as well. I just..I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m worthless, idk why Iâ€™m still living. Anyway, have a merry Christmas guys. At least you guys are happy, so be thankful for that.
