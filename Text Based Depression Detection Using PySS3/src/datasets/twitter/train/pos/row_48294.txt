(Serious) Guys how do I ask out this one girl that I like? So for context I am a sophomore in High School and There is this one beautiful girl I always see in the morning sitting alone before school starts. The only problem is I donâ€™t really know her and I donâ€™t know how to approach her because Iâ€™m a really introverted person. Sheâ€™s a really pretty girl that I would like to take her out, but I donâ€™t know what to do. Any advice?
