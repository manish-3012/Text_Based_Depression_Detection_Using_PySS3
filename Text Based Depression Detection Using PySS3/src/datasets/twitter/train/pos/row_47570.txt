Hey, I have some advice. If you want a relationship for you to be happy, you want it for the wrong reason.

If you are in a relationship, just for you to be happy, you shouldn't be in it.

Listen. You deserve to be happy. But, if you aren't happy by having your s/o happy, you are a problem. If you do things in a relationship or for a relationship that make you happy, but aren't to make them happy, you shouldn't do those things. Ask if they are happy. Ask if they want you to continue doing those things. If they have told you to stop and you keep going, fuck you and fuck your happiness. You are a terrible person.

A relationship shouldn't be to make you happy. A relationship should be to make them happy. You should get happiness from when they are happy. They should get happiness from when you are happy. If this isn't happening, there is a problem.

So, to the people who keep bothering people to make themselves happy, kindly go fuck yourself.
