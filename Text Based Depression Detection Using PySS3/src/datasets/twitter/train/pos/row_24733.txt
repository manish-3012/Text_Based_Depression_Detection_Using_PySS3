Donâ€™t do what I did Basically I wasted my diamonds on a hoe.
So I dated this toxic girl for a while but never talked about but since Redditâ€™s basically my therapy at this point Iâ€™ll post it here. To protect her privacy (even tho sheâ€™s a b) Iâ€™ll call here Sh. Sh would break up with me saying she lied about ever loving me. She would lie about cutting her self. She said she tried to kill herself when she was 7 and bull shit like that.I tried to break up with her but she dead ass looked at me in the eyes and saidâ€ if we break up Iâ€™ll kill my selfâ€ those words stuck with me for the entire time we were dating/friends. sh was one of those uwu pity me I have depression and and want to kill myself uwu type girls. The entirety of that group she had (and still has) was like that (sadly including me) as I got older (and more horny) I asked her to make out with me on my birthday. She said yes. I kid you not after that she broke up with me saying she never loved me at all ever.  We were friends for a while until eventually she started lying about loving me again I just opted out of the friendship after that. Iâ€™ve been way happier now but I think I now might have real depression so that sucks I guess.
(Ps Iâ€™m a guy)
