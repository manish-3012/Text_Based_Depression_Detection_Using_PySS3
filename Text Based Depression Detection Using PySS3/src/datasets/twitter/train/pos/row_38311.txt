Hello friends Hi everyone i hope you're doing well, I'm currently in my last year of high-school but i cant focus in class or at home, knowing that the final exam that i will pass this year is the most important test in my country, i need a very good grade but i can't stay focused for not even a minute straight, if anyone experienced the same thing or have any advice that can help I'd be very grateful to you.
