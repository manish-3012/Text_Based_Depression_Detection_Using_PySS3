Just wondering What kind of phone are you using right now? Iâ€™m using an iPhone 6s thatâ€™s like a fucking potato. Load up navigation . Phone goes from 70% to 0% in three seconds. Canâ€™t back up my photos for some reason even though I have 2gb of space left. So what kind of challenges does your phone give you?
