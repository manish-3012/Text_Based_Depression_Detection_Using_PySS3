I went through 3 history teaches this year. Hereâ€™s my review on each of them History Teacher 1: fun, always used the book, easy to follow, and she let us use the Keurig. And at the end of the year she wouldâ€™ve let us watch Hamilton. Idk why she left, ik she didnâ€™t die, I saw her in a walmart a few weeks after.

H.T. 2: This one was a temporary one, but Iâ€™m including her because she taught for about a month. She taught online and was easy to follow, AND ALWAYS USED THE BOOK

H.T. 3 (Current): He went all around the world! Yet he canâ€˜t use an iMac from 2013. He also is making us find sources and everythingâ€¦ to put 4 words in 2 columns on a PowerPoint presentation. So yeahâ€¦.. 1 star out of 10.
