DAE not hear their fingers tapping on their phone when they type Maybe Iâ€™m paranoid, or being a hypochondriac, but I can not hear my fingers tapping on my phone. The room I am in is very quiet, and I only hear the tapping when I type really quickly and press down more. I also seem to not hear my footsteps very well....
