Feeling a bit lost So me and my girlfriend of two years broke up a about a week ago and I don't really know what I'm supposed to do or feel as it was at the time a bit uncalled for. There is so much going on with this,  school and other things. I really loved her...

I don't really know why I write this, it'll maybe make me feel relived or something. I'm really bad at this sort of stuff.

Anyone got any tips or something to make it feel a bit better?
