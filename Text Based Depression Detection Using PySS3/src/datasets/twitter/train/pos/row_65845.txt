Should I date my friend? (Long sorry) Omg I'm overwhelmed right now. She always kinda said she was straight but we always flirted playfully. We have some weird stories, I kissed her once randomly and she told me a few months later that she has a crush on me, but I was dating another girl back then. Well now we kinda sent each other those really flirty wholesome memes and she sent one that was like "I have romantic feelings for you but I'm too shy to tell you". Well however I asked her out on a Picknick date like the typical cottage core bisexual I am and she agreed. 

However I'm getting kinda worried. I have plans for my future with moving away etc and she's also one of my two best friends. I don't wanna lose her by messing up. But yeah, I definitely am in love with her and right now I would give everything to be cuddling with her. What do you think?
