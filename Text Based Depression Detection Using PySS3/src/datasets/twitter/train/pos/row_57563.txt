a friend of mine passed 2 days ago she was in the car with her boyfriend 2 nights ago and they had a tragic accident and died instantly. It was a shock to the whole class and beyond. The city is also upset.Guys, always live the moments with who you care as if they were the last. (if u don't believe me search on google "incidente SS96")
