Youâ€™re not being brave by not standing for the pledge. Youâ€™re being a disrespectful piece of shit I find it hilarious how people think theyâ€™re being so brave and standing up for whatâ€™s right because they support ACAB and/or thing that America is a bad place to live. When youâ€™re sitting for the pledge, youâ€™re disrespecting everyone whoâ€™s risking their lives to keep your entitled ass safe. Thereâ€™s so much more I want to say but thatâ€™s all for a different time
