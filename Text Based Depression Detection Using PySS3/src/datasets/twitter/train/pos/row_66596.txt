I think my mom dad are using word 'Call' for some secret chat .I think they are secret agents.  

So   yesterday my dad asked me to  tell mom to give him a call. Mom asked me   to tell Dad that her call  lines are not working today. Papa asked me  to  tell mom  that stop  fooling him and ring him a call or else he will  call  outside of home .  at end my mom said If u called outside I will  open  Call center at  home.

I m not able to understand their conversation.

Edit:I m not sure my friend told call means s\*x.. but I want them to be a secret agent :(
