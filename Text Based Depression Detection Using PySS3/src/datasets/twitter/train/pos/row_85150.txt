SOOO uh, I need some relationship advice So Iâ€™m in a relationship with a girl, itâ€™s been on for about a month or two I think, and well sheâ€™s told me she loves me, Iâ€™ve told her I love her, while chabang, but thereâ€™s some things concerning me.

Sheâ€™s in her kinda â€œemoâ€ phase, and she has a great personality, other than the whole emo phase thing, and really Iâ€™m just waiting for her to grow out of it. I love who she is, but not how sheâ€™s acting, and Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s just how sheâ€™s acting and not really who she is but when will this phase of hers end...

Also, she is a bit crazy. She makes homicidal comments, and threats often, and seems a tad obsessive, and gets angry pretty easily, and when she does it lasts a long time, and she just shuts down. Im pretty sure the homicidal shit is just part of the phase, and I hope to god it is, because if she truly is homicidal, I donâ€™t know if I can be in a relationship with her. Sheâ€™s pretty cute when sheâ€™s mad, but I just wish she would communicate when she is mad, because I AM trying to put in effort despite my difficulty with showing emotion, and having emotion. Itâ€™s really hard when I donâ€™t even know why sheâ€™s mad though. 

Thirdly and finally; we donâ€™t really get any chances to see each other outside of school and that is just a big dud on our relationship 

Gonna sound cliche and cheesy, but really itâ€™s a case of heart vs. brain. My brain is telling me to end it, sheâ€™s homicidal (hopefully not actually), emo/alt girls usually annoy the fuck out of me (seriously waiting for that phase
of herâ€™s to end), and really Iâ€™m just not sure what is happening with our relationship. My logic tells me to break up with her, but I just canâ€™t. I want to, but I really donâ€™t want to. My heart is telling me not to, even though it defies literally all logic, and to be honest, shits weird. Iâ€™ve made a point of basing my entire life around logical decisions, and have basically killed my emotions. Now Iâ€™m suddenly just unable to make the logical decision, and really itâ€™s scary and confusing.

I just donâ€™t know what to do, help me Reddit
