A poem to motivate yall Stories begin and stories end
And in life our story just began 
Our character will grow 
through trials and tribulations 
And everyday the plot will thicken 
As we go about our lives
Life is a love story an action movie
What ever you choose to be
We are the makers of our own destiny 
What will your destiny be


Idk i had to write it for my creative writing class
