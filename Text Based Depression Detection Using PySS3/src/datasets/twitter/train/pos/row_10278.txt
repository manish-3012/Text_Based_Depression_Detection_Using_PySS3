I donâ€™t want to be harassed because of my religion Iâ€™m so tired of being harassed and attacked for being Catholic. Iâ€™ve been accused of supporting child rape, being part of a cult, not being a real Christian, etc and Iâ€™m so tired of it. Sometimes I feel like just abandoning my beliefs just to be left alone.
