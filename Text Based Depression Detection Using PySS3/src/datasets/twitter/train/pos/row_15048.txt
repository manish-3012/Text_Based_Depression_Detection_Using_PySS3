Iâ€™m this place is usually filled with memes but I wanna share something Sooooo I used to be a big chonker, and I mean like really big buuuut then I met this really awesome dude and we started talking and no joke this dude made me promise him that I would take care of myself and once we both had enough money to travel/ when we got older weâ€™d date each other and ever since then I have dieted and dieted and I went from 95 kg / 209 lbs to 79 kg / 174 lbs! Ik itâ€™s not much but Iâ€™m a tall boi so yeh ^^ 

Oh and believe me I used to eat a lot, itâ€™s not your conditions that pull you back down, itâ€™s the lack of motivation and luckily for me, I found mine :)
