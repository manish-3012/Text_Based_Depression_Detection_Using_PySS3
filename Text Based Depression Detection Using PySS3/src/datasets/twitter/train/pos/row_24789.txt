Weirdest day of my lifeðŸ˜ so I have woken up at 6am, took a shower, ate, then around 9am I boarded a plane &amp; had a 20 minute plane ride to another town to see a cardiologist about my heart, now I'm stranded in a hot ass hotel &amp; i'm stuck here for another few days without anyone &amp; not even a cup of water. Fucken hell someone kill me.
