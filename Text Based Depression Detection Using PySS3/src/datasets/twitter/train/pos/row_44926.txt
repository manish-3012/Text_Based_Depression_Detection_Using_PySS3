Iâ€™m going to snap Every. Single. Fucking. Day everyone just fucking makes fun of me for being loud (even though I have autism) and calls me the fat weirdo even though I just mind my own business. They throw shit at me, call me names, etc., and Iâ€™m going to snap. They act like theyâ€™re hot shit but as soon as my 390, 6â€™5 frame gets near them they start going into defense mode, trying to solve things â€˜diplomaticallyâ€™. There are only a few people who take my side anymore, and Iâ€™m going to fucking break someone. My friends are all kind to me, and my best friend wants to do something, but I keep telling her not to because I donâ€™t want her to get in trouble, so idk what to do, but I swear I am going to punch someone and get an OSS and I donâ€™t even give a shit.
