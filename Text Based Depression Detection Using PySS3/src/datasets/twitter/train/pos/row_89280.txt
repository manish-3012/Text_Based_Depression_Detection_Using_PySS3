Finally left Twitter today, hello again reddit Deleted Twitter. Felt like a massive weigh being lifted off my shoulders. No cancel culture, no more making everything about politics, no more kpop, no more people trying to get me banned because I had a different opinion. I felt so much happier after I deleted it and my mental health has improved exponentially. Thanks to everyone here for not being like this, making fun of my appearance, and just being all around good people. This don't a karmawhoring post of any kind, I just want you all to know that you are good people.
