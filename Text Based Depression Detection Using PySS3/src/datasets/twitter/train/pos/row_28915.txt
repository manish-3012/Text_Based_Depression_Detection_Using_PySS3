I want to feel pretty too So in my area girls that are blonde and skinny and short or thick latinas are considered beautiful and hot. Me being one of the only blasian 5â€™8 brown eyed girl that I am, gets treated terribly. Iâ€™m always the ugly friend. Always too tall. Boys have told me my arms are too long or Iâ€™m built like a man. And it just makes me sad because I canâ€™t help how Iâ€™m made. Why can I be pretty too? Iâ€™m smart, Iâ€™m funny, I bake and cook, I like sports. I can pretty much do anything and Iâ€™m so open minded and it always gets taken for granted because Iâ€™m not an Addison Rae look alike.
