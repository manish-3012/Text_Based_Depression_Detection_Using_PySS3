Iâ€™m in the middle of a mental breakdown so basically we were outside doing stuff on the roof n I was told to throw a rope up, like wtf I canâ€™t throw for shit. my mums boyfriend was telling me how, n I tried n I couldnâ€™t get it, he insisted that I keep trying but my brother was in a rush since he has class soon. n I just kept telling him to do it since I canâ€™t. n honestly I almost snapped n said, â€˜well I donâ€™t know how to do this, I never had, I never had a fucking father around to show me how to do it, so Iâ€™m sooo sorry I fucking cant.â€™ luckily I didnâ€™t but now Iâ€™m inside laying in bed crying about never having a father. so really good day so far. ðŸ™ƒ
