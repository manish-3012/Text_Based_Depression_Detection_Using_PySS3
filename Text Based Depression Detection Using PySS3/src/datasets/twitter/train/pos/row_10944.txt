My best friend likes me again and idk what to do This is kind of long... sorry..,

So.. my best friend is leaving next week so we hung out for the last time, and ended up making out and touching and we almost went further but stopped because my mom was rushing us home. He was acting really weird when taking me home, and didnâ€™t text me back until the next morning. 

We talked on the phone last night and he basically said that he was loved me and that he wanted to show me and make me see how beautiful I was to him. He said he felt like I was his other half. 

When he said that I almost cried. It was kind of scary and I didnâ€™t know to say. I feel like Iâ€™m freaking out kind of. I donâ€™t know how I feel. I love him but I just feel like I only see him as a friend. 

Heâ€™s liked me before and Iâ€™ve always rejected him... and I ghosted him before because of it. I just felt like I couldnâ€™t handle it I felt scary. I feel like he thinks Iâ€™ll do it again because he keeps making jokes about me leaving him now. 

He also has a girlfriend who hates me. So thereâ€™s that.

What do I do ? Please give any advice. I donâ€™t want to hurt him I love him. 

Tl;dr: my best friend and I were intimate and now he says he likes me and I donâ€™t know what to do.
