Hey guys remember my cat Sunny who was doing super well and i made him a little among us pillow? Yeah apparently hes fucking dead now i left 1 week for visitation with my mum and my stepmom decides to text me one day before i come back and say "oh i have some sad news, Sunny is dead." I fucking loved that cat and you send me some apathetic text like this shit, at least wait until i get home
