When my mom pulls out that southern accent She's not even southern and has never lived there, but occasionally she'll do that Southern long i sound thing so *fire* sounds like *fa(y)r* with maybe a little y sound like normal. Also happens with "while", "mile", etc. But specifically before l, and r. So today she said "Is it on fayr".
