I thought being a teenager was gonna be more exiting. When I was like seven I thought Iâ€™d have a bf/gf by now, amazing grades and a perfect life. But no. Here I am, at 12 pm not having slept yet, endlessly scrolling on Reddit, tired, hungry and alone. I thought I was gonna have hot sex or some shit by now. I really thought my grades would be good too, but oh boy I was wrong.

Itâ€™s that time again, when I crave physical touch and when I want to be in a relationship. I want to share deep eye contact with someone, and then just get pushed up (or push someone) against the wall and just make out for hours. That would be so fucking nice. I just want someone to grab my waist, pull me close and kiss me until I can no longer speak. I want my lips to basically be numb. 

I want to hold someone as close as humanly possible, I want someone to crave my physical contact. I want to be wanted. Oh shits getting deep now, gonna stop before it escalates lol. Anyways, I just want someone to make out with very fucking hard. I want bruises, and I want to leave bruises. Oof. Iâ€™m so painfully single. 

Soooo... any advice? hahahaha, oh- by the way; I already know none of you guys here know anything about relationships and stuff, so Iâ€™m not expecting any good advice. Just writing to get some stuff off my chest, and it might be relatable. Idk.
