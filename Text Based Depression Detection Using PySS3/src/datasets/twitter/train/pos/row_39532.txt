Why people who are against LGTBQ+ rights are wrong. (By an Asexual) Idk if this is the right subreddit for this but I'll post it anyway if you have a better place to post it, and it gets deleted, I will post it there. I also bolded some BIG facts if you don't want to read everything.

Okay, so as we all know there are **alot of people in this world who are really against LGTBQ+** people like myself, and think we are stupid and have been mistaken. Which is wrong. Sadly, In alot of countries it is banned all together and people can be killed for it, or put in jail for a long time. 

**I feel there isn't enough substantial things explaining that this isn't true, and why**. All I can find is things just saying love is love. Which I feel doesn't make alot of LGTBQ+ feel any better about it if they are having problems. **So I decided to write some actually cold hard facts myself**. (Or at least try)  


1. **The christian church has been problem in not giving people the correct facts on THIS topic**. (I hope not to get too religious here) From what I have heard, priest have been saying that this isn't the way god meant the world to be. Which makes people feel bad for being LGTBQ+ people, since most of people in the world are christian (I know not all Christians feel this way I am just saying that some do). **A big point they make is that god made male, and female to love and care for each other.** How do we know who is female, or male? You can't just tell, its something that you choose yourself/Agree with. Also it doesn't say specifically to the other gender **(I believe), meaning that it just means HUMANS in general.**
2. This next point has to do with something that I won't get to much into. **Males and Females reproducing**. First of all with **people who are straight, sometimes they don't even have the thing.** Are people saying that those people are wrong as well? That almost seems like they are against people, who can't even have kids themselves. As an asexual this one hits me the most sadly, and **I think people shouldn't feel bad about this.**
3. The third reason is probably the most opinion based on this list SORRY. **People think against LGBTQ+ just because it's not what they feel**. That's like saying just because you don't like pizza means you are a bad person, which also makes it feel like if you are allergic to pizza you are a bad person. **You shouldn't say someone's opinion is wrong, unless it's psychically or ACTUALLY emotionally hurting something or someone.**
