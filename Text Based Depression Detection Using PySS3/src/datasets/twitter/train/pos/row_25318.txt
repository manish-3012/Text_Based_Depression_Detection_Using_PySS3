Lost after love Me and my best buddy were together from last 4 year. We were like homies. We lived far away and always met in a week or else talk and share things so I never feel distance from her but after she met a boy she's stop talking to me or else she have no more time for me in 24 hrs a day or in a month. It's not her fault I should have been aware. It's feels broken and It's been a year try to ignore myself every night so that I can sleep better. I share this with you bc you guys are like my age and I wish you never ever lose yourself.
