I know nobody cares but I want to share This will be my schedule for my final year of high school:

English 12

Government 

Spanish 2 

Pre Calc 

AP Studio (art) 

I also need to complete Economics but Iâ€™m taking that online right now. 

So, Iâ€™ve been doing combat sports for 2 years now and I ended up falling in love with it. I workout 6 days a week year round now. I think I want to study kinesiology or something in college and eventually coach/do personal training. My biggest dream though is to do MMA. I realized I donâ€™t really like school, so I want to put my energy into what Iâ€™ve liked my whole life- sports. 

Do you guys have any classes you want to take before you leave high school? Do you have a subject you want to study in college? Do you have a dream job?
