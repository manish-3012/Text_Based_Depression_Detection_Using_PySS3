I feel like I'm losing my "teenager spirit" because I simply don't have the energy to play video games watch movies anymore I'm 19, yup, not a teen for long :( I used to play videogames four or five hours straight, every single day. Or watch a 10h Netflix season in one day. Not a problem at all. 

Nowadays, I don't have the motivation to play a videogame for longer than an hour and I can't finish a single movie. I started watching John Wick 2 three hours ago and I'm at the 20min mark. Yeah. 

I genuinely wish I could get that no-life teen spirit back because I've recently preordered a PS5 and accidentally bought a year of PS Now (mistook it for PS+) and I have 14 unfinished Netflix series. Sad times.
