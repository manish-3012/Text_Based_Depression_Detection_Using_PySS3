I donâ€™t like being bad at stuff bruh 2 things iâ€™m bad at: cooking and video games. Sometimes i use the â€œiâ€™m a girl excuseâ€ for that one but i canâ€™t use if my teammate is also a girl. I mean i donâ€™t suck-suck but jesus i feel like a grandma around her. If iâ€™m playing alone I get so mad when I die
