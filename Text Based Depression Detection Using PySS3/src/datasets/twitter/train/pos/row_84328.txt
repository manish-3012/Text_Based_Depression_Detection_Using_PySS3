Does your personality also change acc to what music you are listening to? I'll be listening to daddy issues and crying and then Spotify plays truth hurts so now I'm just vibin and feeling good it's weird y'all and then cigarettes after sex starts playing and now I'm sad but about not having a bf and ugh, but then i don't really want a relationship but songs like that make me wanna have one so that i can slow danc- ugh it's a whole thing

Maybe it's because I'm a teenager and my hormones are kinda crazy?
