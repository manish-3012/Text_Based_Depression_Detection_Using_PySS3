Oh god I've got a huge exam coming soon and I want to do well on it I have a huge exam coming up in about a month (that will determine where I go to school for the next 4 years) and I really really want to get in. Thousands of people from across the state will be sitting this exam and I have done some practise tests (I've gotten low 90s on all of them which is pretty good given that the exams are supposed to be really hard).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm really nervous and I just needed to vent, please wish me luck!
