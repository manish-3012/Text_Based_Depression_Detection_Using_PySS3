I used to have a huge crush on my best friend, but the feelings are fading. Still wanna tell her doe, does it sound like a bad idea? Okay so me and this girl are really great friends, but I had/have a crush on her. My feelings used to be much stronger but now they are not the same. I want to let her know that I used to like her/like her because in a way I feel like I owe her that. If I tell her and she tells me that sheâ€™s interested too, then I would be very happy, but if I tell her and she does not feel the same, then it really doesnâ€™t matter. Would it be weird telling a girl that you used to have a crush and that you still do, but that the feelings are fading? Would it even be a possible good outcome of that? I feel like it makes it less weird if my feelings are unreciprocated if I tell her that the crush is starting to disappear. What are your advice Reddit?
