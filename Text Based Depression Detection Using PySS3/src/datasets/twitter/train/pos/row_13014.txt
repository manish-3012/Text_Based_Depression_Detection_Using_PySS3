My parents know I masterbate and told me in the worst way possible (Tl;dr at the bottom)

So in my family is kind of a running joke where we poke a bit of fun at my dad because he has a bad memory, Iâ€™m usually the one who roasts him. We were all at the dinner table and I(14 yo boy) was roasting my dad as usual, when he suddenly says â€œhow come every time I walk in your room your hands are down your pants? Do you just sit like that all the time?â€ My eyes widened, my jaw dropped, the feeling of sheer terror overcame me. I look at my sister and sheâ€™s just as shocked as me, I look at my brother but heâ€™s younger so he didnâ€™t understand what it meant. I looked at my dad and his face was pure satisfaction, he had found a way to shut me up and he was glad. We ate dinner in silence for the next 15 minutes, Iâ€™m back in my room now and Iâ€™m still in shock. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that I can never leave my room again, for the shock of my parents knowing of my hormonal habits is too great.

TL;DR:
At dinner my dad interrupted me saying basically that he knows I masterbate and Iâ€™m terrified now.
