I lost hope in love Iâ€™m a 14 year old high school freshman, I started watching anime so much that Iâ€™ve lost my love for real girls, Iâ€™m so attracted to these animated girls and their good looks and personality that I wish I was in a comba where I could be with them. Iâ€™m in online highschool since the pandemic occurred and I really wanted that highschool anime love story with someone but I donâ€™t have an attraction to anyone in my classes( not trying to be mean but they are all ugly) they canâ€™t compare to anime girls, they say these are the best years of our lives and Iâ€™m just sad as shit all the time and the time is going by so fast Iâ€™ll be 15 in January and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll never find someone to hold me down or just give me a taste of that anime love or reality, I just hate the idea of getting old I just wanted to stay young all my life, I donâ€™t want that time to come where itâ€™s too late , I really want to find that someone and I feel if I just lose my attraction for anime girls for a real girl thatâ€™ll mean sheâ€™s the one, to be honest I wanna die when Iâ€™m like 30-35 I donâ€™t wanna get old I just wanna stay young forever itâ€™s like watching a highschool anime with all these young characters and then there is just this time skip to when theyâ€™re all adults and you say to yourself where did the time go I donâ€™t want ghat to happen to me cause I already feel the years going by, idk if itâ€™s just me or does anyone else feel this way
