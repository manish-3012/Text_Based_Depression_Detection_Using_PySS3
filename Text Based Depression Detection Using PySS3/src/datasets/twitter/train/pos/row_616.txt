God loves y'all 
some of you may need to hear this, some of you won't care, some of you will think it's utterly ridiculous. but God loves you, no matter how much you are going through, how much you've done, you're forgiven. Things will be tough sometimes, you gotta remember that if everything was all perfect there wouldn't be a reason for him. ask him what he has planned for you, he may answer, he may not. there is a reason. 

This year i believe is a wake up call. God is always close but he is closer than ever right now. with the tragic things happening every month, there's no way it's just a coincidence..it's almost a punishment for the horrible things humanity has gotten into. you may think he isn't a loving God, but if a judge let a criminal off without punishment, would they be a good judge?  this world is falling apart. he is ready, he's coming soon, try to be prepared.
