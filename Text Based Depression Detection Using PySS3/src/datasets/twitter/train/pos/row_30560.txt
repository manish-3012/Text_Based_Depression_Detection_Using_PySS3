Does anyone else feel lost? Idk, I just been playing Minecraft and doing my schoolwork. But now life hits you like a wall of trucks, and I honestly donâ€™t know how to feel about it. One minute Iâ€™m just messing around in Minecraft and now Iâ€™m being told to go to college. I donâ€™t even have any hobbies, I donâ€™t know anything remarkable. I just feel lost at this point.
