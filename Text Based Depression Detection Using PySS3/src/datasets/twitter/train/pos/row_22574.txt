Babies today are too close to screens. I'm not a boomer or anything. Yes I said *babies.* Not kids. **Babies**. You may wonder why.

I have a **one-year-old** cousin. Nothing weird, huh? He doesn't know how to walk without help yet. He doesn't know to talk (except repeating "ma").

But do you know what he **does know to do**? Use TV remote.

That's right, baby who can't even **talk** yet knows how to turn the TV on and off, how to change sound or channel. Babies today understand tech before understanding speech!

"Kids today are too close to tech" thing has come so far that it even suprises us (me). Kids. You may or may not agree with it, but **everyone** under 18 years **is** still a kid. 

I don't want to offend anyone, I was rude in some parts, but I find it really... surprising.. in a bad way. Technology is cool and all but we *could* use it a bit less.

I'm prepared for the downvotes.
