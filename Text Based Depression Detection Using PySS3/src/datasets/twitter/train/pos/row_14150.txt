I resurrected This year I got into highschool and on the first days if online class I realised the physics teacher made a weird face when I turned on the camera this would repeat with both the professors for grammar and math and I just realised why

Last year in the science fair I was absent since I had broken both of my arms in a biking accident 
Tho my friends thought it would be fun to say I had died in an accident and So added a memorial  next to the exposition this was fun for everyone in middle school that obviously knew I wasnâ€™t really dead and I even made FaceTime by an I pad to see my memorial 

The thing no one expected was that the high school teachers would show up as judges to the event and so they decided to act dead serious about my dead  and when my classmates won they even gave a speech thanking me and hoping I was in a better place

This was the last event before covid made is so we had to attend online school so when I entered high school The teachers saw a boy which they thought had died months ago in a zoom call so in their perspective at least in the first day I had resurrected 

TLDR: My friends in middle school faked my deaf to the high scool teachers and when I went into high school they thought I had resurrected
