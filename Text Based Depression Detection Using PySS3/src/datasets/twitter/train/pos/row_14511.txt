A depressing thing I wrote once Following pain

I'm falling and falling just to feel part of my own painful story because there is no one left to tell it. I tred lightly on my tears of which the origin is buried in conflict and the paradoxical nature of things. My freedom is but a dream I have no luxury to own if I want my thoughts to be true and excepted. Fear is a fight between the want and hate of pain that comes with self doubt that I have held my self to in the back and core of my head. I am simply a tool for others to use as the fight for ownership gives rust. Words are vessels that carry power through the pain, if only to fix the path of dismay they leave behind. I am pessimist, I am harsh, I am ruthless, I am one with the crowd. I am optimistic, I am kind, I am gentle, I am left behind to clean the mess I was convinced I made based off my chosen opinions that give no meaning but rather fictional hope of redemption. Life is pure in its problems and blunt in its solution. Life is a truth told by a lier. Life is a path paved by death and followed by the idea of light.
