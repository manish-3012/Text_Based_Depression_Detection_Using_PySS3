I've had a very bad day today This is mostly just me rambling about my day.

It started when I stayed up all night 2 days ago and went to sleep at 8am and slept until 6pm yesterday and I've been up all night (its 6:30pm). I usually go sleep around 10am when I wake up then. I stayed up to watch a streamer in twitch. She ended up starting 2 hours late (things happen thats fine) so I waited an extra 2 hours to see her play a game I don't play. And probably the worst thing thats happened is a old friend tried to contact me. They unblocked me and was just acting like nothing happened even though we haven't talked in months. I answered her as short and to the point as possible. 

Her"Hi"

Me "..."

Her "bark"(she started conversations with the usually)

Me *types something out and deletes it*

Her "whats the point of typing and not responding"

Me "idk how to respond to that"

Her "oh ok" "meow?"

Me "what do you want"

Her "damn thats rude asf" "I'm gonna block you again"

Me "ok"

Her "âœŒ"

A little back story

She randomly started ignoring me irl/in school and wouldn't answer my texts so I stopped trying and gave up completely after a week. I tried one last time a month after all that and she didn't answer. I noticed a few months later that I was blocked by her. Litteraly 5 months later (today) she tried that. This may hard to but that brought me alot of pain. One day fine the next she won't talk fo me for no reason. After I sent her the hi 5 months ago I decided I was not going to move on. I moved on and now she's trying to talk to me? 

Also before she ignored me we talked everyday and video called basically all day everyday. So her doing this hurt me alot and she had the audacity to text me again. I was furious and trying not to just verbally assult her. 

Anyways thanks for listening to me, probably 2 people at most that actually read it.
