"I don't care" is the most hurtful thing someone can say I mean, think about it. What is more hurtful than having someone say that you aren't even worth feigning interest for? **Nothing.**  I mean I know I'm just being a snowflake because that hurt my feelings but like cmon! It hurts even more when it's a family member. *Especially* when it's a family member. Because they are literally saying they do not care about you / what you said. "IDC" is even worse. They give *so little* attention to what you're saying that they shorten 12 keystrokes. So if you read this, don't say shit like that
