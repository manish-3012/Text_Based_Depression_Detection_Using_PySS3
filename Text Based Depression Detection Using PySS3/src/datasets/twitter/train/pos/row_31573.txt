I need help My friend is depressed, he has a girlfriend and 
so many friends to support him, but the issue is that anything he gets into, it seems to go to shit. I donâ€™t know how to cheer him up or what to do. He is a really nice guy but he canâ€™t seem to find himself. I can get into contact with anyone he is associated to like his parents, girlfriend, friends, etc. what do I do.
