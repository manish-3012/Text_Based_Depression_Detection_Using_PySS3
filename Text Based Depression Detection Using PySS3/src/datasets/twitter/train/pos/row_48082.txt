I asked out my crush and she said yes! I know what you're thinking, another one of these posts again, but it's deferent this time. I actually asked her out a long time ago and we've been dating for over 8 months now, but there's this thing we do every now and then that always makes me smile and I thought I'd share. Sometimes we pretend to ask each other out again in strange and creative ways, and even though I know she's going to say yes at the end I still get all excited and giddy when she says it. Another thing we do is we talk about each other and why we like each other but pretend like we're talking to someone else, and we try and convince each other to ask their crush out, and then go and message each other on a separate app and do it and it's just amazing.

I'm sorry for bad wording or anything, I'm not really that great at explaining things, just thought you guys would enjoy some wholesome content.
