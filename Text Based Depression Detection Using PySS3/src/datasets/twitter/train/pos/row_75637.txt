Stuff that Iâ€™ve been thinking about a lot       My crush doesnâ€™t like me back. After a lot of thought I realized she doesnâ€™t like me. Most girls in my class like my best friend. As soon as he walks in the classroom all the girls start yelling at him just asking random things.
I have a couple of classes with my crush and my best friend, and she always laughs at whatever he says.  Iâ€™m not sure if she really like him but def not me. 
       Another thing is my friends are kinda shitty. It feels like Iâ€™m always starting a conversation with them and inviting them, but they donâ€™t ever try to do the same with me. My best friends also really cocky. He thinks very highly of himself and brags to other people. Itâ€™s really annoying.
      Since Iâ€™ve said stuff negative about other people I should probably say something negative about me. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m annoying. Like I have an annoying personality. 
   Anyways, please comment giving advice/feedback.
