My mom is a fucking perfectionist Seriously, I have to find the perfect way to talk to her, never lose my temper, never cry in public because i need to be "stronger". Smile everyday, don't frown, no "talking back", shut up. Be more loving, Be more like my sibling. i'm trying my best okay?! Not to mention how she think talking back is. So for example, she would say something like how does it feel, what are you feeling, during an argument. Once I was stupid enough to answer with annoyed. I guess that was the wrong answer, cause it escalated. Still don't know what she wanted. Another time, I corrected her statement, that we took a quiz not a test, and she just when off on me. I know it effects my fucking grade, I told you, you just didn't listen.
