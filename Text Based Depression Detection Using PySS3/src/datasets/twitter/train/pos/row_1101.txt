Help I play it safe with everyone bc I donâ€™t wanna show them too much of my personality and freak them out I feel like Iâ€™m so weird. I donâ€™t like being boring and making small talk with people that Iâ€™ve known for a long time. I know that I could say something totally strange or unexpected but then Iâ€™d risk losing that person. Iâ€™d rather have them think Iâ€™m boring and awkward as fuck without allowing them to know who I completely am
