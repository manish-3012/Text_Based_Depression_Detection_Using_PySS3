How do I make friends at school? How do you do fellow kids. I'm 16, male (not really but that's another can of worms) and I struggle with making friends. I talk to the people who sit near me in class but we never end up hanging out at lunch. I just sit by myself. I can't really join extracurricular stuff because of COVID. So how can I make friends?
