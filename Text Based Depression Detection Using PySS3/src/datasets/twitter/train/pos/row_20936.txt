Hey everyone! I(18M) just want to see if anyone is interested in talking Just trying to make some friends(preferably between 17-19, tho 16 is fine too), the pandemic has made it way harder to meet new people way harder, and Iâ€™m bored at home. 

My music tastes vary between early 2000s rock(love Audioslave), 90s-2012 rap(like Eminem), I actually also really like Hindi music, and movie/video game soundtracks(the PS4 Spider-Man main theme and most songs in the Star Wars prequels&gt;&gt;&gt;). 

Iâ€™m also into swimming, reading, philosophy/debate, stand up comedy, and love TV and movies. 

I also really like helping people out with their problems, so like if youâ€™d like free advice, lemme know.

So HMU ig
