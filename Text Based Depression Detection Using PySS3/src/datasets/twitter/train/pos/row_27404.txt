After yesterday's events I just realized that after yesterday's events I realized that my online friends are way better than my real ones.If you've seen a post I made yesterday you might know.Yea at least my online friends like what I like and would always talk to me and play games toghether. My real friends are eh.They don't like what I like and don't even want to reply to me.

I hope you guys get it I just need to rant some more hhhh
