I can't talk to people I feel too anxious when talking to people I freak out if someone messages me online and then I delete all my social media to make sure no one messages me. I have one friend but we don't talk anymore because it makes me too anxious. I can't talk to people online it's even worse than talking irl. I never talk to anyone in school. I'll never be able to have friends
