Today marks the first day xan free for me its kinda time to stop cuz its really destroying me rn and worsens my depression.

I decided to finally quit it with the help of my friend, we both promised to stay off it. Its gonna be a hard and long road but i will make it, for sure!

Now homies, it's time to get my shit together and take life on a more serious note. See y'all on the flipside!
