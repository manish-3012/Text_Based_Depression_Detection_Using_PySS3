Do you think our generation will be more conservative or progressive by the time we all reach the age of majority. There was considerable research in the past that gave rise to the idea that generation z, our generation, would likely be more conservative than that of generation y or the millennials. However, after these past four years of unprecedented economic, political, and social change, where do you feel our generation is headed. To follow up, do you believe the direction or generation is headed is a good thing or not. 

P. S. If anyone is interested in potentially participating in a political podcast with wide, and diverse opinions from people our age; 16 ~ 20, let me know in the form of a pm.
