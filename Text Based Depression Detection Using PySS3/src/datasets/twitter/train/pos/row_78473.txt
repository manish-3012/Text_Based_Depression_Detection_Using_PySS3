How do I tell my Parents that I might have ADHD? as the title suggests I think I may have ADHD

I havenâ€™t been able to focus on important school work (never have been Iâ€™ve even tried my best)
and I have all the symptoms of ADHD

being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings.
constantly fidgeting.
being unable to concentrate on tasks.
excessive physical movement.
excessive talking.
being unable to wait their turn.
acting without thinking.
interrupting conversations.

and Iâ€™ve already asked my mom once but she said â€œItS tHosE gAmeS YoU aLwAyS haVe tHosE oN uR MiNdâ€

My Dad is the same

Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t be able to focus on exams and be held back a grade in school.

And in no way my parents will actually take me to a therapist

They are like one of those Parents that think any mental illness means you are insane

Please help!
