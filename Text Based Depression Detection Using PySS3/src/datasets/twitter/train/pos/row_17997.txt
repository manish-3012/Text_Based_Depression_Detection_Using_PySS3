SHAME ON YOU MODS There was a post that was so obviously lying and I reported it. It is still up and people are falling for it. The guy deleted his post history and just did it for the karma. He provided no explanation to prove it was not fake. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE POSTS MODS WE DONâ€™T WANT MORE FAKE POSTS ABOUT PEOPLE â€œDYINGâ€ OF BRAIN CANCER.

It was the post about the guy who was homeless.
