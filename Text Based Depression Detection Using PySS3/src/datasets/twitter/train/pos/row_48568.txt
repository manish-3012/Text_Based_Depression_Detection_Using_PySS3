Iâ€™m scared for next year. So next year I will be entering year 10, turning 16. We got our classes for next year in about September. When we did get our classes I checked mine with the girl Iâ€™ve talked about before, Kelsey. Basically Iâ€™m in love with her and she said I need to wait and see because itâ€™s to early.. yata yata yata. We both had 1 class together. And I was sad by that but didnâ€™t think too much off it. Now, in near December, I feel horrible, absolutely shit and broken. Iâ€™m soooo scared, I only have her for one class. Itâ€™s not even an important class. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to lose her from my life. This has broken me. I love what we have now being in Maths and English with her. Iâ€™m going to be alone in those classes. What if she develops feelings for a guy in her class and heâ€™ll have the easiest time to get with her??? Iâ€™m done for! Iâ€™m actually done! Lunch break isnâ€™t enough for me! I just want her by me... what do I do??? Iâ€™m lost! Am I over reacting??? 

Also Iâ€™m thinking off texting her and telling her this is an issue of mine. Maybe sheâ€™ll clear it up and say everything is fine. Should I let her know?
