Haha story time that nobody asked for So I was at my friend Christians house for his birthday and a bunch of my other friends were there and some people I havenâ€™t met before so we went on a walk to giant tiger bc itâ€™s close ish to Christians and on the way back I was walking w these two guys (my friend Connor and this kid named Nolan who I hadnâ€™t met before)  anyway we were just walking and talking and stuff and I said I was cold (it was soo cold out) and Nolan just put his arm around me and was like let me fix that (haha Ik itâ€™s kinda corny) but that he asked if I was fine w it which I thought was nice.on the way back we just talked abt random stuff. Anyway we got back to Christians and me and some of my friends were sitting on the couch he just sat beside me and but his arm around me again I thought it was kinda cute then we are all watching a movie and I was sitting on this like love seat chair thing he came and laid beside me and we cuddled during the movie anyway now we have been talking on snap like all day anyway yeah ahah if u acc read this whole thing good job
