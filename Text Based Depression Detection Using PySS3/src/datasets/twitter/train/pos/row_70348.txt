I canâ€™t submit my big civics assignment due in fifteen minutes because my wifi keeps going out Itâ€™s crazy. Ever since like 11:20 last night Iâ€™ve been tryna submit it, but the wifi keeps going out before it fully uploads. Iâ€™m actually getting pissed off. I wonâ€™t even be able to attend my class because of this wifi.
