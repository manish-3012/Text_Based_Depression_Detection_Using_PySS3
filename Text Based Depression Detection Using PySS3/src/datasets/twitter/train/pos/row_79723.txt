Yâ€™all ever just think about the origins of the Universe? Incoming existential crisis. Iâ€™m going to apologize in advance for how I may make you feel by making you think about this. Donâ€™t read if you donâ€™t want to. 

So the origin of the universe is kinda fucking insane and makes little to no sense if you think about it. Like, the Big Bang happened, but what was before that? Where did it all come from? It had to come from somewhere, so where? It couldnâ€™t have just, always existed, you know? Itâ€™s just, youâ€™d think there would be a way to explain it, but there isnâ€™t. I donâ€™t get it, I honestly donâ€™t know if anyone ever will get it. Even black holes are fucking insane. Information canâ€™t be destroyed, but black holes destroy information. We have absolutely no idea what goes on inside of one because of that. Anti-matter should also exist in the universe according to math, but it isnâ€™t here. The CMB gives us an insight into the beginning, after the Big Bang, but what was before it? Was it a singularity? If so, where did the matter from that singularity come from? Was there another universe before it, that all succumbed to gravity and fell back into itself? If thatâ€™s the case, how many universes have gone through their life cycles before? How many will come after ours is gone? How many intelligent species have existed in these universes, and how many are in our own? So many questions that I will likely never get the answers to.
