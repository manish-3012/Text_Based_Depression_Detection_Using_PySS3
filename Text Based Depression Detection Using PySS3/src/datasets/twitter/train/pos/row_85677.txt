If i die, i want laura's theme from Silent Hill 2 to play at my funeral. Two days ago i've passed Silent hill 2: restless dreams on the original xbox. I am and i will catch the dog ending of the game. When i passed the game two days i started to become happy and cry, being a big silent hill fan, i want that song to play at my funeral. Peace outðŸ¤ŸðŸ––
