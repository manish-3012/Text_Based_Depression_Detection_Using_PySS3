WTF SERIOUSLY WTF IM SO FUCKING PISSED OFF I've been exercising every single fucking day, eating 100x healthier and less than usual, I've been trying for 2 weeks and I fucking gained 2 fucking kilos

But my mum's bf, who eats junk food and whole blocks of chocolate every single fucking day and never even exercises or works, lost 3kgs

I'm so fucking jealous and I'm never capable of getting a healthy weight, I've always been overweight all my fucking life and no matter how hard I fucking try, I just gain weight

I should just give up and just become a fat fucking blob because I can't do anything else
