Boys, I happened. I was casually walking down the streets with two close friends. Two girls walk around a corner. they were same age as me (14). There was a tall girlaand a blonde one. I look as I dont like eye contact, but I spot out of the corner of my eye, that the blonde girl is checking me out when she passes us. My bros look at me like â€œyoooo, nice dudeâ€. 

So yeah, a cute blonde girl checked me out. And my self-esteem skyrocketed. 

Sorry for bad english. I am not a native speaker.
