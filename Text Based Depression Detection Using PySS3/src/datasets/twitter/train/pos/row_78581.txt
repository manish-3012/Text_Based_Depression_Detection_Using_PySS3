Why I dislike my sister Okay so at my house I have a little recycling bin that needs to be emptied into the big recycling bin outside when it gets full. My mom always complains that she's the one who always has to take it out when though it's constantly full with her cans because she's low-key an alcoholic but anyways, here's the conversation that just ensued: 

Sister: Will you take the recycling out? I can see that it's full.
Me: Why can't you take it out? You're right there.
Sister: Because I don't want to. (Proceeds to sneer at me)
Me: Oh wow, really?

Then my mom proceeded to yell at me for saying that to my sister. Whenever mom asks her to do something, she says no and throws a fit. I'm so sick and tired of it. I always get yelled at but my sister can just say no and throw a fit. She never takes out the recycling and I can't believe the audacity rn. She tells me that I'M lazy but she proceeds to look at the full recycling container, and delegate it to someone else.
