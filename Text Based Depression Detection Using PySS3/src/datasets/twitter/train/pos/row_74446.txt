Boobs and Hentai. Now that I have your attention, lemme tell you something important.

Height doesn't fucking matter. To most of the girls. 5'9 or 6'0 is NOT the bare minimum required. Sure, some women prefer men like that, but that's their own preferences. And they don't represent every women on the planet. Memes and all shaming these women just adds to the insecurity of shorter men and does no good. ( Ngl, some are hella funny)

Now, this is not coming from a 15yr old girl. I'm a 5'3 guy.  And I have literally turned down a girl who grew a crush on me when I was there for her during a mentally tough time. I don't wanna go into that but I just said that to show all of you shorter insecure fellas out there that you just gotta be nice. 

A caring and nice persona is really all that matters. Sure, impressions are one thing, girls with height preferences are not the nicest about it, but that don't change the fact that at the end, all it matters is the size of your-

Heart.
Stay safe y'all.
