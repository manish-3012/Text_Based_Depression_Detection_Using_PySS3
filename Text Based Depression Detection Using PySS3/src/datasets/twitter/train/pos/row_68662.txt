Funniest Sh*t Ok, so. In my school, the break is separated in two parts. In the first half, we take off our masks and we eat. In the second half, we pack up our food and put our masks on, only I'd this half can we talk.
Now... it was the first half and, like always, my class is talking and so am I. But then, this teacher comes into the room and gives us a lecture because we were talking, so everyone shuts up and we expect her to leave the room now that she is done lecturing us, but she stays. The tension is so strong, that you can cut it with a knife. But then, you hear what sounds like a whimper coming from beside you. You look to the girl beside you and she is clutching her nose, face red, and smiling like Joker. That girl is me. But I'm not the only one trying to not laugh my butt off. The 'class clown' is also trying not to laugh hysterically.
When the teacher leaves, however, it feels like this weight that was in the classroom just dissipates and everyone looks at each other with a face between 'funniest crap' and 'did that actually happen?' and a smile that would put Jeff the Killee to shame
