My school is making us go back and isnâ€™t allowing us to wear masks + some other bullshit These bastards literally put in the school newsletter that we have to wear masks coming in but father that and in lessons we canâ€™t wear them. WHAT THE FUCK. To me it sounds like they just want it to look like theyâ€™re enforcing hard restrictions to people that will see but as soon as weâ€™re behind closed doors they donâ€™t give a fuck.

my school has over a thousand students and the corridors are about the width of two school tables. There are so many people passing through the same place because of short cuts and itâ€™s already a nightmare to get through, how theyâ€™re going enforce social distancing is beyond me and the fact we canâ€™t wear masks is just gonna make it worse. I have friends that are at risk so this shit makes me even more mad

they said a whole year group has to stay in the same building for everything except lunch and break, a whole year group is over two hundred students and the high traffic area I mentioned, everyone uses that to get to their hangout at lunch and break. Oh I just fucking remembered, we all have different classes with different people so how are they going to get everyone out of a class social distancing style to their next class in FIVE MINUTES. Oh an DONT get me started on those people you know wonâ€™t follow any of these rules and will share food and drinks during lessons so thatâ€™s contact right there
