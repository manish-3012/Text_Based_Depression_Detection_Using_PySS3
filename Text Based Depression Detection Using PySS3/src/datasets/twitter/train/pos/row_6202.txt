How do I stop procrastinating? Nothing seems to help. Iâ€™ll get an assignment thatâ€™s due in two days and wait until the night before itâ€™s due. Then, Iâ€™ll keep procrastinating until itâ€™s 4 in the morning and I need to wake up right afterwards, which is what Iâ€™m doing right now. Thankfully Iâ€™m only in ninth grade, so messing up a test or two isnâ€™t the end of the world, but I need to get myself back on track because this just isnâ€™t working. Have any suggestions? I feel like some of you guys are on the same boat as I am.
