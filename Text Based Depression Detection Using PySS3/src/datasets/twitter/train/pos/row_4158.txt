Everyone should learn the same language Iâ€™m not saying we should all learn 1 language exclusively but we should just all agree on a language and teach our children that in addition to the local language 

It would probably be either English or Latin but as much as I hate Esperanto itâ€™s kinda perfect if youâ€™re going to teach it to everyone but thatâ€™s all itâ€™s good for, imo it should be either Latin or Korean probably Latin cuz you wouldnâ€™t have to learn a new writing system and the grammar is relatively flexible, technically itâ€™s not flexible but you can rearrange the words in a sentence in any order and it will mean the same thing even though only a couple of those will be grammatically correct
