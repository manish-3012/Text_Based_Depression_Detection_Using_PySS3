Really feeling down today, donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Really feeling down today, donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me.

I completely skipped school without my parents knowing, never in my life have i done what or thought of doing it, i didnâ€™t enjoy practicing my hobby or eating my favorite food today and tried a few other things that keep me happy but nothing worked, i feel absolutely unmotivated right now.

To add, whenever i get sad people never notice, and apparently my behavior today was alarming to them, i donâ€™t get what they mean. Also i almost lashed out on a few friends on something I personally find stupid.
