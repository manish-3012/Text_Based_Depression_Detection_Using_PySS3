i feel so annoying all the fucking time iâ€™m in the middle of a severe mental breakdown, and i mean that by the genuine medical definition, not the quirky one. 
 
and iâ€™ve bottled it all up. 
 
i love my friends, but i feel so annoying. i just keep accidentally venting in the server and iâ€™m talking so much and itâ€™s so stupid i feel awful like why do i need to be so.... like this (?) sometimes. like i need to stop venting and being emotional and all that i just feel like i wear other people down and i donâ€™t want to hurt or inconvenience them iâ€™m literally such an awful friend sometimes and it hurts me so much and i feel awful saying that because itâ€™s so selfish like i canâ€™t imagine how they feel 
 
makes me feel so awful and so annoying and i just feel like a fucking burden. 
 
iâ€™m just a fucking burden.
