Fasting for 2 weeks! I need to lose weight, Iâ€™m not â€œobese or overweightâ€ I have a pretty decent metabolism &amp; I just canâ€™t shake off the extra 10-15 pounds that I need to get rid of in order to feel confident (Iâ€™m 6â€™3) so I thought, why not eat for 2 weeks, Iâ€™m going to only consume water &amp; take vitamins. I know this is dangerous as hell, but itâ€™s literally the only way I can lose weight. Wish me luck ig. Iâ€™ll report back when Iâ€™m done!
