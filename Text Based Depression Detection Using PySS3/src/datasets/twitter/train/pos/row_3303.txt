I love pre-term surveys They have question like "after making mistakes do you expect to get back up and try again", but obviously I never make mistakes so why should I even answer that. And why bother asking if I will be excited for my labs, like, of course im gonna happy to show up to my 8 am lab every Thursday morning.
