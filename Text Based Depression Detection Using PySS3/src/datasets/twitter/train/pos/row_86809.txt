Do you all casually talk about generally sexual things with friends? Every now and then iâ€™ll overhear something in school and be like WHAT Stuff like NNN, porn, jerking off, sex between each other, 16,17, some 15 y.o. btw.

My friends and I think itâ€™s super weird to even bring up anything of a sexual nature in conversation. Maybe I just have really virgin friends, a 16 y o fiend asked me what bdsm was last week. 

Thoughts?
