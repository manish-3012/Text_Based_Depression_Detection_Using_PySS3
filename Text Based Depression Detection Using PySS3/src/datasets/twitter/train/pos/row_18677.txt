I want to have a girl friend I can hang out with not a girlfriend, I don't want anything romantic

I want a friend who is a girl

I feel like I have had deeper and/or more spiritual conversations when I was hanging out with girls rather than with boys

I could probably hang out with a very non-masculine boy as well

I guess I just want a friend who can emascuate me and we can just watch some movies and get emotional together ;-;
