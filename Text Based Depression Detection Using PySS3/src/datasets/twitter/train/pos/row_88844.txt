You don't know self-discipline until you try quitting weed in the middle of a pandemic I used to smoke at least once a day since last year because it helped me cope but I need this. I wasn't expecting withdrawal symptoms for fucking weed but damn it's impossible to sleep and when you do you wake up drenched in sweat from your 2 hour sleep. It's waking up nauseous and restless in the middle of the night and losing your appetite. Fuck me this is only day one
