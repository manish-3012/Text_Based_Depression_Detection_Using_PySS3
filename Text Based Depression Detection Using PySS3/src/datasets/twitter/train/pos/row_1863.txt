I fixed a dead mouse cave man style Ok guys... so here is a funny story.... my mouse from pc is 5 years old (long time I know)... no rgbs, no 1k of buttons... is just a simple office wireless mouse.
Giving the fact that I have it for 5 years it reached his warranty period long time ago, and a few minutes ago the inevitable has happened.... it died (initially I thought that the batteries died, but I swapped them and the mouse still didn't turned on so I reached the conclusion that someting broken inside of it. I decided to open it and everything looked normalish... appart from 2 connectors that looked like they sat in battery acid and I thought that was the problem. And for whatever reason I plugged in the batteries that I removed and flick with my finger one of the sensors and it started... I was like... u son of a bitch u did it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
The morale of this story is that if ur mouse is not working just hit the sensors and hope for the best....
Good night or good morning if u are watching from US.
