Why donâ€™t people just wear body cameras all the time? Often in legal disputes it is â€œhe said X, she said Yâ€ and there is no discernible evidence apart from witness to said activities.

If you are wearing a body camera that is constantly uploading to the cloud and when shut off is immediately sent to the local authorities/constantly shared with them for possible evidence of investigation you should be protected under the law no matter where you are. 

Someone should try and make this lol - it would help keep law enforcement and really everyone accountable for their actions and save a lot of interpretation that can go on for days
