when you wanna put mehndi/ henna but can't Its Eid soon and I wanna put mehndi/ henna on and just put my name and a simple circle but I can't bc my mom doesn't know how to do that bc she's not into that and last Eid my step mom did it but I don't live with my dad anymore so I can't do that, this sucks bruh, I could ask my aunt when I go there tomorrow but I feel like that would be weird, idk maybe, she's a chill aunt but it's still weird
