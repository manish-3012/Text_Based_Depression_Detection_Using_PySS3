Hi! Help me! Please read the whole thing before judging me. 
  So basically, I think Iâ€™m becoming a transphobic piece of shit! Fun! 
 Jokes aside, I would never treat anyone differently or judge them for choosing to identify as a different gender. I have a non-binary friend and Iâ€™m always careful to use their correct pronouns and name, but the thing is, and before you judge read the whole thing -
  I canâ€™t imagine gender dysphoria. It may be that Iâ€™ve never thought about it but I genuinely do not believe in gender dysphoria. Which makes me feel really awful. Like seriously. Along with a couple of of other problems Iâ€™m losing sleep over this and I canâ€™t focus on online school coz I feel so awful. I genuinely do not believe in gender dysphoria. 
  A couple of my friends have tried to help me with this (including one who is perhaps the most supportive person I know) but I still do not believe in it. 
 So please help me. Anything. Convince me. Argue with me. Or kill me lmao 
  Anyway thank you for coming to my ted talk on why Iâ€™m a piece of shit!
