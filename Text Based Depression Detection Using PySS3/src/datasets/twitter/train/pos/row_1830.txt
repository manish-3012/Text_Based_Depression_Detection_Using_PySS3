Hello fellow teens, help me with my senior quote I have narrowed it done to two options
1. â€œThe roof is not my son... but I will raise itâ€
Or
2. â€œIf no one comes from the future to stop you from doing it, how bad of a decision can it be?â€

You can vote in the comments, feel free to give other suggestions as well, Thanks!
