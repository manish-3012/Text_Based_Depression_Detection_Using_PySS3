I'm lonely..... Yesterday I was feeling lonely that I don't have a gf. I can't share my feelings. I posted here about how does cuddling feel and people replied. I felt more lonely. I just slept later. And guess what, my cousin (a little distant cousin)that I've always liked, came in my dream. We shared our feelings and talked and absolute fun dream it was. We also cuddled (I'm pathetic). And I've been thinking about that all day. She's about two years older than me. I was just not feeling right so thought I should share my experience with other people.
