FireRed Nuzlocke log-1.5( as the original post was removed) ( Yes Nuzlocke is an Artform&gt;) This is my first time trying a nuzlocke.

I chose Charmander as my starter and named it **Smaug**. After bring the parcel for Oak I received 5 pokeballs, and my first encounter is a ratata who I named Micky. I defeated my rival in route 22 and encountered **another ratata** whom I named **Minie**. I entered route 2 and BOOM......................**another ratata**. I named it RatRap and entered the forest where I encounter a Pikachu, whom I named **ChiliPeper**.( It's a Jojo's reference). I then  grinded ChiliPeper and Micky up to level 10 and evolved Smaug into Charmelion.

I am now headed to Brocks Gym.

Edit:  I defeated Brock, but ChilliPeper is dead :(
