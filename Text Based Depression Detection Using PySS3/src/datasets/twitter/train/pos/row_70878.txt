This dude I know doesn't like anime and it annoys me how proud he is I am really not one to like anime. I'll watch a few episodes of DBZ if it's on, but i'm not one to jump onto anime. I don't like it, but I don't hate it.

So this dude (we know each other and we're roughly the same age) is a huge asshole. He's really arrogant and always calls me by my last name. He's essentially Draco Malfoy for me and my friends. People outside of my friend group don't like him as well, but overall, he's just a dick to me.

Now into the story.

So i'm talking with my friend. He's explaining the plot of an anime and i'm not really paying attention, as i'm not the kind of person to watch anime (as I mentioned in the intro). Suddenly, this kid says to us, "I don't like anime. Japan is pretty stupid." So me and my friend  just kind of continue with our conversation and he suddenly says louder, "I hate anything from Japan and the people who live there". I kind of chuckled considering the fact that he was wearing a pair of shoes *from Japan*. So not only is he being a dick, he's being racist, while at the same time being ironic.

He keeps trying to talk over us and he eventually yells at me, "WHY THE FUCK WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME" and my friend and I are just kind of stunned. He made it sound like he was entitled for us to stop talking. It was lunch, so everyone was talking. Eventually, the teachers came over and took him to the office. I still have no idea what happened to him and it was pretty funny to watch.

Have a good 2021, folks.
