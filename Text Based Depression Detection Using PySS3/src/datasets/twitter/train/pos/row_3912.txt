Why do yâ€™all girls text â€œI-â€œ in every frickin conversation? I swear, every text conversation or group chat Iâ€™m in, thereâ€™s always a girl that says â€œI-â€œ after something â€œshockingâ€. I have never seen a guy do it, and itâ€™s multiple girls who do this. Am I crazy? Am I obsessing over something small? Probably, but can anyone tell me why you use this so much?
