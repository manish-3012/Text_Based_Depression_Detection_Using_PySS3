I got a sewing kit for christmas like I asked for it's got needles, thread, scissors, a pincushion, and a thimble so I don't poke myself

What should I sew first, guys? Some ripped pairs of pants of mine? A few buttons onto shirts that are missing buttons? A fursuit? give me an idea for anything so I can embrace my femininity
