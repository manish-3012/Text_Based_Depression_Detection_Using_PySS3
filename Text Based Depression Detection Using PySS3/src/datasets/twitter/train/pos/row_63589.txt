My friend just called the lgbt community (and being part of it) "modern slavery" I am fxcking dying. How did she managed to live this long?! How can someone be so fxcking stupid.

I really don't know and honestly I'm just sad for her. How can somebody so close minded be happy? And she just goes on and on about how smart she is and how she can think outside the box.. please send help

And if she sees this: now you know how I truly feel about our 'friendship'
