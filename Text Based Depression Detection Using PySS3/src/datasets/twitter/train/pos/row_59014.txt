Guys don't randomly unplug your fan when it's on I leave my fan on in the "night" so I don't have to hear people talk while I'm trying to sleep so this "morning" I woke up to get ready for work and I didn't feel like crawling to turn off my fan and the plug is right where I was so I just unplugged it and when I just came back from work I wanted the fan on but now it won't work. I think I tried my fan.
