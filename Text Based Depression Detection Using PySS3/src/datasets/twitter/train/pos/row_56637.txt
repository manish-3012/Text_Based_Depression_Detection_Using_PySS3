Fellow teens, Has anyone found good ways to help with ADHD and/or Procrastantion Im gonna be real, ive tried talking with school counselors and its helped a little, but seriously i still struggle because my ADHD cant develop the habit because i cant be consistent in using the stratagies long enough for them to work. Ive downloaded apps, set alarms (the best one ive found because it can snap me out of my hyperfocus), written things down, tried a watch and i cant seem to get it? Any advice?
