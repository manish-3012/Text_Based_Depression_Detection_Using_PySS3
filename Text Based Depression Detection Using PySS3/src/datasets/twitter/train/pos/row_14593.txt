okay I know no one care's but I feel proud So my gf has been feeling down about how she looks so I asked if I could do a photoshoot of her. I then asked my friend whose dad runs a modeling agency if he could ask her if she would like to be a model which she wouldn't take but the gesture would be nice and once he did that she's been really happy and proud about her looks.
