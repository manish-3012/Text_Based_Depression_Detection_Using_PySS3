What's the point of school anyway Seems like a basic rant, but here's my story.

I'm a high school freshman from an asian country that puts a lot of pressure onto the kids, and every thing is graded relatively. I got a 96% on my korean exam, and it's still a rank 3 grade. 

I don't feel like I'm learning anything in school either. It's just rote memorization of random things like the number of rice bags people had to pay as taxes in the Chosun Period in korea.

School bores/stresses the shit out of me and the only class I can pay attention to is coding class where we learn python. Idk, everything is so pointless. Everyone here is just blindly unaware of these things and whenever I bring up how the school system here is shit, they just ignore me or treat it like a joke.

I wish I could learn stuff that actually mattered or interested me. I just sit through the day listening to music or reading books in school. 

Thank you for coming to my ded talk.
