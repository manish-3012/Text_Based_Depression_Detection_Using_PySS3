Have your homies ever called you handsome in a non homo way? So my friends and I were on discord and they asked to see my face since we haven't actually gotten to hang out in almost a year. I showed them my face and they were surprised to see my face. They said I looked good and that my chin was nice. Now to be clear these guys are straight. I personally think I'm a little bit below average but that made my day. Thanks homies.
