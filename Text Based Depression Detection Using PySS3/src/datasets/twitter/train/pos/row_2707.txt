Need some motivation to study and do homework 10th grader here and I started online school last week and I hate it I can't focus in my lessons for shit and when it comes to homework I either copy it or just not do it and this year is really important I can't get low grades but I just can't bring myself to do the work so I need some advice and motivation. What helped you become a better student and is there anything I can do to motivate myself to study.
