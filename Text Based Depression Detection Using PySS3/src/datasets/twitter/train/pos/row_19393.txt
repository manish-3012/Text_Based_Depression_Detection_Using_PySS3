What the fuck, Breaking Bad was shoved in my face trough the years and i haven't even noticed I wanted to install Kingdom Rush vengeance again since i have the habit of playing these games again. And at the last boss fight one of the characters says i'm the one who knocks. My first interaction with Br Ba  was when i watched that animeme video with Jesse. All these years i had the show spoiled to me  and i haven't noticed . And a month 2 months ago i started watching it. Coincidence i think not
