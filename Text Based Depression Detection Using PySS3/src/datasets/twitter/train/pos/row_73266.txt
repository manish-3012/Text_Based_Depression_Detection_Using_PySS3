FUCK you Chloe 2 days after I had found out that my brother had died on January 6th, (2020) I was in school and this girl, Chloe, said that she liked me, and asked me out. I was feeling pretty bad then and that kind of brightened my day. 

The next day, on January 7th, I took a day off of school to go to my brother's funeral, and was back in school on the 8th. 

That day we were changing seats and when I moved to Chloe's table, she moved to a different one, leaving me alone with Delaney. Later, I asked Delaney for a pencil, and Chloe, seeing me, said "You're cheating on me? We're through!" in an exaggerated tone. I tried to ask her about this later but she ignores me. 

Finally, at the end of the day, when I caught with her and asked her, she said,  "I was joking. You're Cody, no one wants to date you."

Now I'm aware that this she's a rather insignificant person, who I have no attraction to, and that our non existent "relationship" means nothing to me now, but what kind of a fucked up joke is that? To shit all over someone at one of their lowest points like that? How much of a sociopath would you have to be to do that?
