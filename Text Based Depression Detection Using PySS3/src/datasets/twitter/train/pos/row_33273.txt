Guys, DONT DRINK COFFEE AND GATORADE It tastes terrible and you will regret it.
I was just minding my own business and left some coffee on a table that I promptly forget about. I felt thirsty a little while later so I got some blue Gatorade. While drinking said gatorade, I realised I had not finished the coffee so I started to drink it, my whole perspective on life has changed and my day was ruined before it even started because of the rank mixture of drinks that ended up in my godforsaken mouth.
