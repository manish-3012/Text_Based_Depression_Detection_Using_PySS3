A slight breakdown Hey fellow teenagers, is there a subreddot where you can talk with people when you are about to cry because you have not ever been wanted by anyone as a partner and most people find you annoying, stupid or weird, and you just really need a hug but you cant because its fucking 00:12 AM and your friends arent nearby?


Im not trying to karmawhore, but i understand if you'd say that. I just really need to talk to someone that is like me
