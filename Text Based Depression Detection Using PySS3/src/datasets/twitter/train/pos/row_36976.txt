Three random facts everyday until I get a girlfriend day #7 It is after midnight here so let's go
1. Pigs' orgasms can last 30 minutes. Oink

2. J.R.R Tolkien and C.S Lewis were best friends who inspired each other to write "The Lord of The Rings" and "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" respectively.

3. Squirrels plant thousands of trees each year by merely forgetting where they put their acorns.

Have a good day, my buddies :)
