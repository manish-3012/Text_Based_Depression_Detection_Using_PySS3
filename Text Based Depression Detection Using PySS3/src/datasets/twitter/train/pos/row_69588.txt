Report xgoodvibesx3730 on Xbox pls He scammed a $20 item on rocket league off me with a fake middleman. He said he either does the trade how he said or he can get reported, so here we are.

I donâ€™t have many accounts for it to make any difference. I did tell him that I would report on a few accounts but I donâ€™t own many so if youâ€™d help me out, Iâ€™d appreciate it.

Again, *he* said that if he doesnâ€™t go through with it properly than I can just report him.

His fake middleman is Josh1205hou
