Ok people have to stop denying otherâ€™s problems because others have it worse. Iâ€™m Catalan and made a post about independence. Some asshole says my people canâ€™t stop whining about independence. I replied saying that maybe the cultural genocide was not so great and we have a reason. He responded by saying itâ€™s all fiction. You know the mass killing and banning of our culture up until the 70s maybe was not fake. You know since I have dead family members from then. He then said you shouldnâ€™t complain because Jewish people had it worse during ww2. I know this is all true and Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s not but then I said that doesnâ€™t mean nothing happened and then he got mad and called me a nazi. Huh.
