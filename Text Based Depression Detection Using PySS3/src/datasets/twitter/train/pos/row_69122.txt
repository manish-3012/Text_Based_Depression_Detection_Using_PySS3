Couldn't post on r/OCpoetry, so I posted it here if that's ok. It's my first time writing poem, so don't be too harsh please Dreams

&amp;#x200B;

As I walk through the darkness, I get the feeling that I am being watched

The thick fog is my protection from the outside

Despite that, I feel as though I am being watched

As I walk around, I feel something, an unbearable guilt

I have no questions but one

What have I done?

I have only one answer

But I can't bear to face the truth

It is the guilt that I feel watching me

It is not fun, but I know that it is the one feeling I have

This fog is my protection and it has been broken by the guilt

If only this were a dream, I would ask to wake up

But this is reality, and the reality I face

I know in my heart that it's not a dream

But please wake me up
