One of my classmates got hit with a golf club in the head We had just taken our school pictures for the year and it was our PE period but the gym was taken so we went outside and played some golf until one of us got hit on the side of their head with a golf club. When I saw him he had a bunch of blood on his shirt and apparently the club had hit his ear. He said it didnâ€™t really hurt but he left school shortly after that. I donâ€™t know what happened to him after that
