Have confidence in yourself After hard work I have finally scored my girlfriend who I've liked for 2 years now. 

What worked for me was complimenting her once in a while. Doing it too much will make it awkward, so find the perfect moments. Ask if she wants to go eat lunch with you one day. She may take you up on your request, and that's a good sign. Don't forget to never give up. If you continually show your affection to her, she may catch on and it'll be easier to ask her out. 

Don't strain over the fact that if she does find out about your feelings it will ruin everything. If she finds out it might be easier for you to talk to her about it.

Sometimes people are assholes, and sometime others don't like you as you do they, but don't let that bring you down. You are who you are. Be who you want to be. 

I wish all of you the best of luck!
