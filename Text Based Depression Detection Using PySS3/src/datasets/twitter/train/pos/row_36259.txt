Am I being a stick in the mud? Today my mom forced me to attend a raffle thingy with the rest of my class. I wasn't so peeved because I thought it would be fun. Anyways I and my mom and dad log onto the meeting, there are not that many families there, so the teacher decides to buy some time and play some dates. One of the dares was to dance like a chicken and caw. Refused to do it but mom forced me, I flapped my arms once. I now am on the brink of crying, having a room. The people watch as your parents make you dance like a chicken, and rapidly blink to avoid crying. Anyways the show thingy keeps going and they get to the bingo part. Nothing important happens during bingo, they then go back to the "dares". They say that to win I would have to get on the ground on my back and squirm like a roach. I refuse and my mom starts calling me a sourpuss and yelling at me for becoming a recluse that sits in the corner all day. They keep going, then at the end they ask me to say my thoughts on the event. I was so scared and insecure that I stayed muted and pretended to word stuff. My mom saw this and told me to turn on my mic. I do and I say "it was fun". I just said that, that's it, God I hate my life I could have at least said something. Anyways the event ends and my mom calls me a stick in the mud and goes to her room.

It might sound cringy but every night I usually go to my parents room and sit in my dad's layzboy about 4 feet from their bed. I watch TV with them or just go on my phone, I like the company. Anyways I would normally be doing that rn but I think my mom is mad at me, maybe not and she just went on with her day but idk. Anyways thx for reading.
