Confessing your feeling to your crush is NOT worth it boys, keep this in mind 
â€œYou only live once,â€ â€œshoot your shot,â€ â€œyouâ€™ll never know unless you do it.â€ These are just 3 of many misleading and unhelpful quotes intended to encourage people to tell their crush how they feel.
I must say from experience, Iâ€™ve had 2 crushes who Iâ€™ve confessed to, I told them how I felt and I got rejected, firstly, I know why I got rejected because these two situations I was really young and stupid and could have done so much better so me getting rejected wasnâ€™t a surprise. Sure, Iâ€™m just one guy out of millions, but trust me when I say, getting rejected hurts, a lot. 
Unless you and your crush have both given really obvious signs that you both reciprocate the same feelings towards each other, confessing just isnâ€™t worth it, youâ€™re better of just keeping your mind off the girl.
Go watch a movie, start exercising, and try your best not to think of them, if you feel like theyâ€™ll say no or you just want to get it over with, donâ€™t, just leave it. The fact of the matter is that if they like you back they would probably tell you, without you telling them first. I myself currently have a crush who I spend days thinking about and asking myself how sheâ€™s so fucking pretty without makeup and how she has the best personality, well itâ€™s dawned on me that she does not reciprocate the same feelings that I have, and I was really close to just confessing and saying â€œthe worst she can say is no,â€ but I realised that if itâ€™s guaranteed that she would say no, then thereâ€™s no point in going through the pain in confessing.
Confessing your feelings to a girl has like a 5% success rate and unless you see that she likes you back, those odds arenâ€™t going to be in your favour.

This applies mainly to boys who have female crushes
