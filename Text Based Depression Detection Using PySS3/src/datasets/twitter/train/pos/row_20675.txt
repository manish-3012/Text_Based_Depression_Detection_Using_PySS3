My alarm clock malfunctioned Instead of 7, it woke me up at 6:15

And I canâ€™t just grab my phone and go back to sleep because no electronics in my room, so I grabbed my phone and went to the couch. 

Nope, mr baby brother had a doctor appointment at 8 that he has to not sleep for and stay hungry and grumpy!!! Of course just my luck
