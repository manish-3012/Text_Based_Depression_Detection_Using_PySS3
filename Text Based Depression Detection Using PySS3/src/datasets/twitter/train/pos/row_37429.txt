If you show me something outdated, donâ€™t get mad at me for thinking itâ€™s up to date ffs Today at school I was required to fill out a paper where I would choose my subjects for the year. I was required to get 60 points and each subject was worth a designated amount of points. So I chose some and calculated that it would be 60. I brought the paper back and I thought that was it. Until I was approached by a teacher, who said â€donâ€™t try to cheat your way out of this. You canâ€™t choose under 60 points worth of subjects.â€

So then I calculated what the points would be and I got... 60. Then I asked the teacher to calculate it herself. She then told me that arts was only worth two points despite it saying 4 on the paper. She then asked â€didnâ€™t your big brother or cousin tell you that thatâ€™s outdated? Nowadays arts is only two points.â€

Why tf did the paper still say 4 then?? Anyway I chose swedish as another 2 points and that was that. 

One time I asked if I could go to the bathroom during class, and I did get permission. The second floor bathroom was out of order so the first floor was my only choice. I headed there and on the girlâ€™s bathroom it said â€only for the disabledâ€ i then got confused because we didnâ€™t have any more bathrooms so I headed back to my class and asked the teacher where I could go. 

â€Downstairs bathroom, duh.â€

â€But it says itâ€™s for disabled people only..â€

â€Not while the construction is going on upstairs! Didnâ€™t your older sibling tell you this?â€

She then called me dumb for not knowing that it wasnâ€™t actually only for disabled people
