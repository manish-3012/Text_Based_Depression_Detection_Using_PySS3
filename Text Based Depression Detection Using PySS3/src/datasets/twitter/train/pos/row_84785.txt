this might sound edgy or dumb but i kinda wanna experience being drunk iâ€™ve had alcohol a couple of times but i donâ€™t get the appeal, especially beer like it tastes like stale frog urine or expired juice to me. i also had a sip of tequila once and literally dropped to the floor. and i probably  donâ€™t have any tolerance bc iâ€™m a girl and never drank before 

my dad doesnâ€™t hide his alcohol cause he knows weâ€™re not drinkers nor does he care, someone could drink and dilute it and he prob wouldnâ€™t notice. iâ€™m lowkey thinking about trying tequila again

anyways this post was inspired by another teenager saying she got drunk for the first time on her homemade wine and planned to do it again because it was so fun. wine tastes gross too though ngl but i wanna feel loose at least once
