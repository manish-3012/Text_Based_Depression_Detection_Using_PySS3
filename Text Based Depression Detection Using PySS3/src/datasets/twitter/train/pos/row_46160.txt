I want to come out to my friends but covid is happening I have three close friend who I trust. I only have two friends who I don't trust. One who told my crush I liked her and one I just don't trust. Anyway I don't want to tell them via discord. I want to tell them at school or at a sleepover. Or on a bike ride.
