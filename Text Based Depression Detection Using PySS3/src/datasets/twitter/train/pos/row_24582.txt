PPL r being too harsh on game freak... Game freak aren't lazy, they're doing their best. Gamefreak were developing multiple games at once during the production of sw/sh, and yeah it doesn't look or run the best, but it's still pokemon.
People were expecting a massive overhaul to all of pokemon mechanics, but would that still be pokemon? Sword and shield is still a really fun game. People just don't want to like game freak, you were begging for gen 4 remakes, got them, and even the ideal pokemon game that you wanted, but youre still bitching about how nobody asked for it.
If you can't see any good in the new pokemon games it just wasn't made for you. It was made by an autistic for autistics after all.
