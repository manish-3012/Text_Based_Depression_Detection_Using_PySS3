I'm not ready to move on from you yet. I don't even know if you have Reddit, but whatever. I just need to get this off of my chest.

I know we've had our issues over the past year or so, and we haven't talked in ages, but I still have feelings for you. I like you so much. You are the light of my life and one of the first girls who I ever felt a true connection with. When I was depressed, just seeing you made me feel better even through all the stuff I was going through. You were the best. I'm sorry for not even trying to text you last summer and then getting on your nerves like I did and I won't do it again. I just want us to at least be talking again and maybe even take it a step further than that. And taking it a step further, more than being friends is what I want to do. I've told this to a lot of people and they're just telling me to move on and forget. But I'm not ready to do that yet. 

Drew, I'd love it if we just started talking again and maybe even go out. Maybe going out in these turbulent times, but anything would do.
