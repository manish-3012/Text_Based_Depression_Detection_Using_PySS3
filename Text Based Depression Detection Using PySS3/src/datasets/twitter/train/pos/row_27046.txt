Life sucks, especially love and feelings So my life in the short version: Was bullied at elementary, then still in the 5th and 6th grade. I'll graduate this year. I'm A musician without ANY gigs right now.
And my main issue: Can't meet friends or HER. So many friends of mine are very busy and that sucks. My sing and song writing workshop isn't going on for about seven months. Last year I had a very hard crush on a girl over six months and I've never had a girlfriend.
I met another girl half a year ago. And I guess there could be something between us. BUT her parents are very strict and she isn't allowed to meet with a "stranger" (I'm not a stranger to her of course). In addition to that she's like not time to text or FaceTime with me but I'd really like if we could meet and may we could even get together.
Write whatever you want guys, just wanted to get that off my chest.
Btw, new here.
Ps: I guess I'm kinda depressive for a one and a half year, no motivation and other symptoms. But I've never thought about suicide or smth.
