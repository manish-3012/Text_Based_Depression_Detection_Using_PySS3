I need help a deciding My Uncle is in the Hospital, and the Doctors gave him just today, saying he wonâ€˜t be able to see tomorrow, the problem is my mother told me I could go but his daughter would pick me up, but I donâ€˜t like being around others and be quite as it gives me a weird feeling, and my Uncle canâ€˜t talk, so its going to be a stop and stare, but I donâ€˜t wanna be the jerk that didnâ€˜t meet his Uncle, and I know that I will get a call from my Father, who is not in country right now, that I am a jerk and talk me to shit, even worse I am trying to distance myself from my Family on my Fathers side, I donâ€˜t want to be shittalked too, so help me decide, cause I canâ€˜t decide myself
