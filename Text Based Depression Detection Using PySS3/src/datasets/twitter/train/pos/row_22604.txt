This says a lot about society Let me tell you a story about injustice. One day this young latina girl came to the United States. She was looking for a job. 5 years later she becomes successful and gets invited to BBC news to talk about her success. She reaches the BBC news headquaters and 5 men interview her. Instead of interviewing her they start roasting her and being racist to her. She tries to take them on. To learn more information search up "Young latina takes on 5 BBC".So sad
