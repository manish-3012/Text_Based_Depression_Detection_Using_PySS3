My professor pulled me aside after class today to tell me just how much she loved my paper!  I have been working harder to have better sounding papers, and its paying off. She pulled me aside and said she loves my writing style and she read my paper twice cause it was so beautiful and i should consider publishing it in our college paper. I'm just really happy cause it was a personal paper. We had to reflect on our sense of place and home, which is a difficult topic for me as I didn't always feel loved at home and drive thousands of miles a year for school. I'm a junior in college now and it just really felt nice to get that positive of a reaction towards something I created. Anyway, then we boned.

Thanks for listening, much love
