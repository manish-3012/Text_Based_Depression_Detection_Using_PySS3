My dad thinks itâ€™s my fault that Iâ€™m getting pimples on my face Last week I got a pimple I was with him in the car and he was like stop doing what your doing and get clear skin like other people, today I woke up like normal then studied for a while I got a random pimple on my nose while studying  and now he is telling me that Iâ€™m not listening to him I havenâ€™t done anything Iâ€™m just doing my homework
