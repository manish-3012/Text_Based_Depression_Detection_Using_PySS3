Girls or guys with longer hair, how do you dry it when its wet? I have gotten kind of long hair now, for a guy atleast. I've kept drying my longer hair the same way I did when I had short hair, I just rubbed my towel with my hair so it got kind of frizzy or whatever and then combed it if needed. But with longer hair it feels like im breaking my hair. 

Im not sure how I should be drying my wet hair anymore.
