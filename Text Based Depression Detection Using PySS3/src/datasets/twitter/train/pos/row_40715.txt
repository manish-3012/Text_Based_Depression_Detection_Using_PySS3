Update post: I spoke to my dad about my brotherâ€™s relationship with our step-sister Look at my previous post for context. I spoke to him and he said he would keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Although, he hasnâ€™t seen anything that would raise any alarms. 

Iâ€™m still disgusted by the both of them. I feel so much disgust and anger to them I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever go away even if I wanted it too. 

I used to always look forward to my step-sister visiting or coming to visit so we can hang out but now I just want to block her and his number.
