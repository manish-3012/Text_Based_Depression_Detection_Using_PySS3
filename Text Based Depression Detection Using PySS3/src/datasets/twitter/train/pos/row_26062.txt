Iâ€™m the only one in my family Well Iâ€™m the only person in my family that can carry on my last name. For the last 4 years Iâ€™ve been thinking about this and I realized that if I donâ€™t have children then my last name dies here I feel like Iâ€™m doing something wrong but I also never want to bring a child into this world because itâ€™s a harsh reality for them to live, this has been worrying me for the last 4 years because I donâ€™t know what to do about this. I donâ€™t expect any response from anyone at all. I probably wonâ€™t be replying to people. Thanks for reading
