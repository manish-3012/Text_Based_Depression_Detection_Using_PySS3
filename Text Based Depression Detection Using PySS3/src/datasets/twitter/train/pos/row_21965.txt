My friend (LGBT) assumed my sexuality I was chatting with my friend (I'll be using they/them pronouns as I don't wish to reveal their gender) on Snapchat, and we decided to make a playlist together. 

I jokingly said that the songs they added were made for the gays, as I know my friend is LGBT. And they responded with "yeah, we are ", as in me and them. They also made the cover of the playlist LGBT related. 

First of all, I've never said explicitly that I was part of the LGBT. Secondly I don't think it's OK to assume peoples sexualities. Thirdly, I don't like labels, they confuse me. And lastly, I haven't figured out that part of me yet, and I don't need to rush it either. 

Idk, it was kinda off putting. I have nothing against the LGBT community. I just don't like it when people make assumptions about me and say things about me that I don't want to reveal/figure yet

I consider myself questioning/queer, but I still don't think it's fine to assume. Does anyone else feel the same? 

TL:DR friend assumed my sexuality and it put me off.
