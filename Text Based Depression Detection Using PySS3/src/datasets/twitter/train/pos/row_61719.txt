Omfg Omfg guys please read this, my crush likes me back but my socially awkward ass doesn't know how to confess Ok so I just discovered that my crush likes me back and she even calls me CUTE

OMFG guys it never happened to me idk what to do now.
My serotonin levels are over 9000 and i HAVE to tell her my feelings, but idfk how to do it.
Any advice please? What should I wear and what should I say to her?
I will probably freeze while talking to her so I need to boost my confidence... But how?
