Do you really believe that looks doesn't count? That Its only the personality that counts.  Like i would wanna be the best version of my self i won't make excuses to be unfit or not take care of myself by thinking that *hey my friend's say that i have a good personality*. 

I think that's just a way of people to say you don't look good enough. So don't get fooled, work out, be fit, eat healthy coz in the end when you're at your best you'll be more confident which will affect your mental health.

Like there is nothing wrong being the way you are but would it hurt to make efforts instead of laying in bed, watching porn, eating 5 to 10 bowls of chips, and fapping everyday?

Have a great personality but imo you should have a healthy body to accompany that and be your best self.

It changed my life. Hope it changes yours. Peace.
