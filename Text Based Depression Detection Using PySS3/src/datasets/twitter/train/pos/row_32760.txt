I'm asking out my crush today. It's you guys. You're my crush. Are you going through some shit and want someone who'll listen to your problems? Do you want an e-boy to call your own? Do you want *two* boyfriends?

If you answered "yes" to one or more of the following questions, then congratulations! I am now humbly asking everybody who sees this message to become my boy/girl/them-friend!

With me as your boyfriend, I will;

- Provide for you
- Tell you the worst jokes you could think of
- Struggle to say or do things that don't really require that much effort
- Quote memes
- Talk for hours about things I learned while on the internet at ungodly hour of the night
- Possibly give you something this year that isn't entirely shit

In return, I am allowed to call anyone else who recieve this message my Significant Other as well, amassing myself an army which I will call upon in my time of need. 

If you're still reading this, then thank you for your time, and if you accept this, then thanks, babe!
