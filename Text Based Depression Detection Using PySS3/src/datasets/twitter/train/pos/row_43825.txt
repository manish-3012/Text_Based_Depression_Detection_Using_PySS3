You ever feel like your stress and anxiety is building up and it's about to burst? That's exactly how I feel. I don't have many places to vent, so I hope r/teenagers will welcome me. I've been doing a lot more social interaction these past 2 weeks and all my stress is building up (note, im on antidepressants, so I think my anxiety and stress is being bottled up). Anyway , thanks for reading if you do, I don't expect a lot of people to. Good day fellow gamers:,) If you'd like a little context, I have a post about getting put on antidepressants if you'd like to look at it
