My sister is entitled, my stepmom is making it worse, and I canâ€™t have privacy in my own room. I donâ€™t feel like writing out more examples, so Iâ€™ll use the most recent one.

Last night, my dad old her that she could sleep in our room (I sleep in the same room as my brother) if she was good and got her schoolwork done. She got it done, but was a nightmare the rest of the day. Because of this, we were told that we could decide if she slept in our room or not. Of course, we declined because itâ€™s our room, not hers. Last time we let her she started moving everything in here, calling it her room, and throwing a fit when we told her to get out, or even just put some of her stuff back. Well when we told her no, she started crying, hitting me, and accusing us of never spending time with her. For more background, I spent almost the entire day with her. So we eventually get her to leave, after I promised her that she could sleep here next weekend. She leaves, tells our stepmom (her mom), and she comes in saying we have to let her sleep in here. I told her that I didnâ€™t like that, wasnâ€™t comfortable with it, and what do I get? â€œSuck it up, itâ€™s just one nightâ€. Thatâ€™s what she says every time, and itâ€™s never just one night. It happens repeatedly. So I told her that this is our room, not hers, and she has a room to sleep in, to which I get â€œwell her room is trashed and her bed is covered in toysâ€. Guess who did all that? My sister. Itâ€™s not like it was out of her control. I bring up her hitting me, and itâ€™s brushed off as me making it up. She gets what she wants at our expense, and we have to deal with it. So she ended up sleeping in here, being loud, preventing me from sleeping, and I canâ€™t even make her leave. Iâ€™m not even allowed to lock the door when Iâ€™m changing. Sheâ€™s sleeping right now, and I barely got any. 

TL;DR: My sister threw a fit after being told no, she got my stepmom to let her have her way, and I still have no privacy in my own room.
