Hello. Im at a "Party" and I wanna ask my crush out on a date. Im nervous So this is my first post in this sub. Me and some of my friends have started a "party" (having a couple people over) and one of the girls that came has been my crush for about...3 years now. She has flirted with me before but im not sure if she actually was flirting or if I just took it as flirting. All my friends are saying I should go over and ask her but they havent always been the most reliable. 

Anyway i came here to reddit to ask one question (well 2. Think of it as 1a and 1b). Should I go ask? And if she says no what do I say? I dont wanna ruin are friendship and make it awkward but I really wanna ask her to. Do you guys have any tips or advice?
