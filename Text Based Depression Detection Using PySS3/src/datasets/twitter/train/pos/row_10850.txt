Grandparents are the best: it's like parents but they actually respect you I am sick and tired a parents shouting and always treating their children with lesser respect than an another normal human being.

My gf can't stand the presence of their parents and actually moved with their grandparents for college even if it didn't ease her journey to the campus, just to escape the toxic environment as fast as she could.
From personal experience i usually am in a better mood when i am staying at with my gparents and as a kid i went at their mountain house to do summer homework just for the calmness.
Maybe during college and late highschool years, after such a long time together parents just can't stand us as much as we can't stand them.

I know there are insane grandparents, but i feel like that on average they are less insane than parents.
