Kawaii gf sign up must be same age as me and must have watched all of anime, submit resumes below Now Iâ€™m not a weeb but I have always felt everyone who is and has ever been in love is just faking it for the rest of us for a sick game of Yahtzee, 
Jk Iâ€™ve definitely been in love
And in true fashion of a rant no Segway
Idk I just feel like love has been so exaggerated people donâ€™t know what it is, or disregard what they have in search for something greater but that something just isnâ€™t there, and I understand that Iâ€™m a 15yr old who knows nothing about the world and itâ€™s not that easy to just lower the bar, but I beg you anyone reading to hold onto what you have w anyone and if you like someone donâ€™t be a bitch and say it from the start so your not stuck playing cat and mouse over who likes who. The failures will be worth a success, when it comes. This doesnâ€™t mean shoot your shot at any member of preferred sex(s) you see, but if your ever thinking hey, they are kinda cute, do yourself a favour and say hi. 

TLDR: love is exaggerated and unknown to at least the people Iâ€™ve met, it doesnâ€™t have to be much also shoot your shot u pussy.


Fuck re-reading this it is a shit show I am so sorry

And yes, this is what no pussy does to a man, or very little.
