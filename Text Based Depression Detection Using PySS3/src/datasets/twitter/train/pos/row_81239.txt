I forgot some stuff for school..... Sooo, we've been reading Kite Runner for like almost a month for English class, and I have a test on it tomorrow.  Just thinking now about how I only read the first 10 chapters of like 40.  I  cant really read the rest before then.  Any ideas of things I can do to not **completely** fail?
