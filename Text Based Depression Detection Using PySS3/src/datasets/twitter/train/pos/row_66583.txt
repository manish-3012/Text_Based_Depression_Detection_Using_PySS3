(19m)Just met with a guy. And i'm F**CKING GIGGLING about its awkwardnesss So i met him on grindr. We noticed that we are just 3-5 blocks away. So we decided to meet up. We didn't do much, we just talked for like 5 mins and then he went to jog. Well i couldnt even say it was a talk tho. He could not look at me. We were walking while talking, and so he was always ahead of me. He literally said:
"Im not awkward, its just the way i am". 

Lololollo

It's my first time doing this. So i also didnt know what to do. I'm a person who laughs at awkwardness, and this awkward is something i have never experienced before. So i wanted to share it.

K im done
