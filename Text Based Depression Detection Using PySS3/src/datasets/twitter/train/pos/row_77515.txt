You know what really grinds my gears? Cancel culture, or better yet,

Cancelling of FUCKING CARTOONS

You really think youâ€™re helping something by removing Pepe le Pew, or Speedy Gonzalez, or removing Elmer Fuddâ€™s guns?

You think people are gonna grow up and become r*pists by watching Pepe le pew with Penelope or mass shooters by watching Elmer Fudd shoot his guns? A bunch of latino people love Speedy Gonzalez, even Gabriel Iglesias himself came to his defense. 

Such a fucking toxic and pointless agenda man I swear
