Can't stand this sub anymore, sorry leaving because it constantly reinforces my jealousy of other people having love while I don't, and the seeming unending nature of memes and rhetoric surrounding having a girlfriend. it's selfish, but I just need to stamp these perpetual feelings of loneliness out. I've been around for here a while, I'm turning 19 soon, but I still feel like a useless unwanted sack of shit, and the environment here feels equally as cold as in real life. there's just something wrong with me. anyway, see ya. I'll come back the day before I turn 20. I hope I won't be as miserable as I was then as now. I hope I find a place in this world.
