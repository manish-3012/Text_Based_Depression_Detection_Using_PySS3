Donâ€™t be an immature bitch. Piece of advice for the self-centered people: THE UNIVERSE DOESNâ€™T REVOLVE AROUND YOU, KAREN. No matter what you say you canâ€™t make up for doing or saying something terrible and acting like itâ€™s okay because youâ€™re you. And then thereâ€™s the ones who fake depression and always say stuff like â€œyou know I have depression right?â€ and â€œI think Iâ€™m just going to go cut myself now.â€ MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A JOKE. DONâ€™T TREAT IT LIKE ONE.

Edit: This also includes people who say they didnâ€™t ask.
