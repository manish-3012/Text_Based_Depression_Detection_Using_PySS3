What do y'all think when people say that teens are "reckless" and "think they're invincible"? I really disagreed with these sorts of statements when I was a teen (about 2 years ago). I didn't think I was invincible, and neither did the other teenagers I knew. And I certainly wasn't one to take stupid risks. Maybe it was because we heard all the horror stories about having an invincible mindset (especially those of us who were taking flight lessons). Or maybe the news and social media have been doing a good job lately with showing us how irresponsible adults are and why we shouldn't be like them. Even now, I don't think teens think they're invincible or are as reckless as they used to be (if they ever used to be as reckless as the researchers claim). If anything, we're probably all feeling doomed and just hoping we can make it through this thing called life (ok, I'm exaggerating a bit).

So yeah, those are just some of my thoughts. What do you think?

P.S. Dang, writing this makes me realize that I still feel like I'm 18 even though I'm 21. I wonder when I'll really feel like an adult? :\\
