ok i need advice I like my friends brother. Not only is he a freshman and i'm in seventh grade but i told my friend i liked his brother last year and he didn't talk to me for a week. i told him i didn't like his brother anymore but it's not true. I started to think Caleb (the brother's name is Caleb and the friends name is Spencer btw) liked me around last year. last year we started hanging and texting without Spencer. Even though i told Spencer i was over Caleb my feelings have only grown and i mean a lot. i don't think i'm in love with hi yet but i want him around me ALL the time. 

What do i do?
