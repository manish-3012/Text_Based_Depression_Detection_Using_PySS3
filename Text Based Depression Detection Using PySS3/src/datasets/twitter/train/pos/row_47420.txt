I have written a short story to celebrate 440 Days on Reddit today According to all known laws
of the Internet,

there is no way a Redditor
should be able to have sex.
  
Its social skills are too weak to get
its fat little virgin body up the social ladder.
  
The Redditor, of course, tries anyway

because Redditors don't care
what other humans think is impossible.

The Redditor will try to impress, and simp, and show off internet points

but of course he doesnâ€™t realize they serve little to no purpose in the slightest.

The Redditor, of course, ignores this and continues to rack their points up

while not realizing the best way to impress fellow humans, is to start by saying hi.

**This is just a J O K E. You all will go on to do great things, and just because things donâ€™t work out now, doesnâ€™t mean they wonâ€™t later. **
