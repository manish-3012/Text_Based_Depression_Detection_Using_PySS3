Feeling hella nice....my life is starting to brighten up I came out as Pan/Lesbian a few days ago, cried a shit ton. I made breakfast for myself after 4 months of not preparing anything for myself. I would usually skip breakfast too so ye. Now I feel much nicer, I have a date with a girl from my school and I have never been more excited to meet someone new. She's a badass bitch and I can't wait to hangout. I don't want to be sad anymore.
