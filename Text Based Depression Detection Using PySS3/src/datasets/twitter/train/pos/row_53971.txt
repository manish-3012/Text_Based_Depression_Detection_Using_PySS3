Advice Needed! I hardly talk to my crush &amp; never told her anything but recently out of the blue she removed me on FB &amp; Insta etc before sending a request &amp; deleting it on FB? I can still see her status on WhatsApp O.o

My question is: Does she know? How? Is this a way of rejecting people? I have been rejected F2F before but this is kinda new thing to me :)
