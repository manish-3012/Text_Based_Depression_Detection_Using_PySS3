Self reflection (Attack on titan spoilers ahead. Youâ€™ve been warned) Iâ€™ve been watching Attack On Titan. Iâ€™m currently on Season 4 Episode 3 (no one from the original season has been shown yet. Still on the WW1 / WWII thing with a focus on Zeke and Reiner). While I was working out today I realized that down bad me being in that mindset where Iâ€™m like â€œoh it would be nice to have an SOâ€ or â€œoh damn I canâ€™t even get a girl Iâ€™m such as a failureâ€ is very, very shallow. Instead of focusing on girls, I should be focusing on being productive and improving myself into someone I can be proud of, not other people. AOT made me realize that, while weâ€™re not hunted by 9-15 meter man eating predators who are actually humans themselves, we have a host of other problems a lot more important than finding someone you resonate with. Thatâ€™s what makes us different from other animals: we as humans face many obstacles that test our ability to persevere and prove ourselves in our own unique way. Feeling frustrated about not getting a girl and focusing on finding an SO instead of improving as a person is just downright weak in comparison. I know me making this post about this topic is shallow as well but itâ€™s necessary to seal this once and for all.
