you guys ever read â€œa rose for Emilyâ€? itâ€™s about this old woman who finds out the guy she loves is gay so she poisons him and keeps his dead body

this was fiction written in 1930 and itâ€™s scary how that actually wouldnâ€™t surprise some people now, weâ€™d be like â€œyeah, itâ€™s weirdâ€ then never look at it again
