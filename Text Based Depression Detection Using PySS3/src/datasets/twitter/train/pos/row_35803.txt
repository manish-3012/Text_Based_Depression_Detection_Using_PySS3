I'm tired Hello,Im just trowing my thougths away to calm myself,you could do like if this does not exist.

I'm tired of school,and I know studies are important and I know,I'm planning going to university in the future,but man,I'm tired of hours of studying in subjects that Im going to forget in 1 year,I study for every exam like 4-5 hours,to get a 5 or even less (Im sorry Im not drom the US so I dont know how the marks work there) ,its a lot of frustation having to study to things that are completly useless for my future,and I know that if you have a lot of knowledge its going to be more easy to find a job into the future.

In some assignatures (I dont know if thats how you say it) I simply cannot find any motivation to study, (in the assignatures that I like I get very high marks with almost no effort) ,its so frustrating,I just want this year to finish so I can forget about all of that bs (sorry for the bad word) 

For those of you wondering ,In my country studies go into different "levels" and Im about to pass the last obligatory ,so In the next year I can focus on things that I really like and forget about all of this.

Thats it,bye.And if you read all the way down here,thanks for your time wasted reading my life :).

Sorry if there are some gramatical errors,english is not my first lenguage.
