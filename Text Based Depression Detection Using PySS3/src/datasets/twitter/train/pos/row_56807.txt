I had a dream that predicted the end of the pandemic I had a dream that predicted when the pandemic will end

I had this dream about 2 weeks ago, so some of the details are fuzzy but the important ones are still there. It starts off where Iâ€™m somehow teleported to the future (canâ€™t remember how). I find that I am in a mesh between my school and a mall. It appears that the pandemic has ended and everything went back to normal. I knew that Iâ€™m in the future but not exactly when (my guess was about 1-2 years). So instinctively I wanted to know when the pandemic ended, and started to ask people. No one would give me an exact date, just that it was over. Next thing I know Iâ€™m being chased by an FBI agent in a ninja outfit (I assumed it was for time traveling). After running for a few seconds I jump through a big glass window on the second floor and start zip-lining uphill on a telephone wire. They eventually stopped chasing me, and at the end of the telephone wire was a small secluded book/board game store. I walk into the store and itâ€™s pretty unorganized, and in the back room thereâ€™s a small round table in the back room. Sitting at the table there was an old man (~70) and his grandson (~20). They invite me to sit down with him, after taking a seat I ask them if they know when the pandemic ended. The old man tells me that the pandemic ended on January 1st, but then his grandson chimes in and says â€œbut before that the pandemic got worse on October 19thâ€. They didnâ€™t tell me any other details than that. This is where the important part of the dream ends. If this is some type of premonition, my interpretation of it is that schools will shut down again on October 19th and a vaccine will begin to be distributed on January 1st.
