I just realized that spoiled little bratty kids you see on social media will be part of the upcoming new generation. It's going to be end of humanity. Those kids will grow up and have their own children. Imagine their baby crying for food and the parent shouting: "STOP CRYING YOU STUPID NOOB, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT". I think they will barely abandon their toxic nature while growing up. 

Those grown up toxic people are gonna taunt others in real life, maybe people will develop personal rivalry and will end up murdering each other. Many rivalries, many deaths.

I don't think they are gonna act mature. 

98% of the whole roblox community is toxic 5 year-olds who give death threats to anyone online steal their parents card and ID to play in a digital hell. Imagine them being the next generation.

Earth needs some cleansing.

But there is still hope, because not all kids are dumb and spoiled brats. And they will be the next generation.
