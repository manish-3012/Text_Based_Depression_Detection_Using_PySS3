lol how didn't I realise this Ok so I was sitting with my female friend who is considered the "hottie" of her neighbourhood. Some guys come up to me and ask me if I wanted to play some football(soccer). I declined because I was having fun with her and we kept talking. Then as soon as they left she starts freaking out. She said that they probably wanted to "talk" with me. Lmao nice. She thinks that my voice scared them off because it was pretty dark and they couldn't see my size and probably based me off of my voice and I have a pretty deep voice for my age. Nobody asked for this but I gotta share this right?

edit: If it wasn't for the dark I would have got my ass wooped though
