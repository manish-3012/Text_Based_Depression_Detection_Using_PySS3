Minecraft is a Drug Let me explain. My family is known as a â€œTiger Familyâ€. Since like 1st Grade my Entire Family needed to get straight As or we would be punished. I probably am the one put through the most pressure (Iâ€™m the oldest). I have to get above a 95 or I will have a stern Talking to, Below a 90 Iâ€™ve never know because Iâ€™m too afraid to go near that. My Siblings were taught the same way. Only difference is that my Sister was allowed to get As and Bs since he loved dance (I donâ€™t know man). My brother had all As up until This year. He got a Mac and started to want to be a streamer (Like that Dream or Tommy guy). I kinda helped him thinking it wasnâ€™t gonna last long, but oh boy did it. School started and my Brother was failing, like 20s-40s failing. My sister also was failing but for a different reason. So My Mom limited Minecraft, he kept going. She Banned him from his computer (which I used from time to time) away, he was still failing (not as bad). Now today he didnâ€™t do his work and she said that there will be no more video games or TV until He starts passing. Thing is we share a room. I am grounded for my Brothers grades. I have All As still and have to tutor my Siblings from time to time and I get punished. It isnâ€™t fair, Minecraft caused this technically.
