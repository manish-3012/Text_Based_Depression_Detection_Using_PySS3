To anyone who wants to try to compare the BLM protests to the attempted coup d'etat by the Trump supporters please fuck off and rot in hell Here's a few reasons why they're completely different


1. The BLM movement was to bring attention to the systemic racism in America this was an attempted coup d'etat and an attempt to overturn a complete legal election


2. 93% of all BLM protests were peaceful so shut up and look something up past fox news headlines


3. BLM never broke into a federal building because if they did they would've been shot on site but when white Trump supporters do it the cops move blockades and open doors


4. Most of the violent BLM protests were assholes using the protests as an excuse to be violent and steal


5. BLM were treated like terrorists but these people were treated like a 8th grader tour group for almost the whole thing had the "protesters" if you can call them that been black they would've been shot, arrested, and beaten had they had been muslim we'd be bombing their country
