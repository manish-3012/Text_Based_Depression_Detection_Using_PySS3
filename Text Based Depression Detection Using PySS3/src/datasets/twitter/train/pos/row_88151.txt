Iâ€™m trying my best Iâ€™m literally trying so hard to lose weight but itâ€™s never good enough. I hate it. People judge me on this damn number on a stupid scale and I just want to be done with their constant assumptions. Like what did I do to offend you other than be overweight?

Sorry Iâ€™m just really angry that people feel the need to constantly start shit. Then I start stress eating and the cycle continues ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸
