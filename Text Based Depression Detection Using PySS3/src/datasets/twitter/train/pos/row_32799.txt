People you wished you would have helped if you knew them Hi how is everyone 

I go to high school with a lot of people Iâ€™ve known since middle school. I watched a lot of the people from my middle school go through a lot of things that sucked. I donâ€™t know why but sometimes I feel I could have done something to help them. I wasnâ€™t partially friends with these people but I was on a first name base them. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m the only person to feel that way but Iâ€™d like to hear your thoughts.
