Yo what if I like kill myself right now Is it a good idea because honestly I am tired of myself. Tired of looking in the mirror and being disappointed, tired that I am not what I used to be, or not what I had hoped to grow to be. Thought Iâ€™d be more mature, talented, handsome, happy, sociable, but fuck me, the day I hit puberty I lost all sorts of shit. The ability to sing, the willpower to do things, just what used to be â€˜meâ€™.
