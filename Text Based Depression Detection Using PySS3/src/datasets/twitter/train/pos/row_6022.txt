Freestyle I wrote. Sorry, touchy subject. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m fine right now. What do you think of it? Addicted to these cigarettes.
 
Keep asking, â€œHave I pulled the trigger yet?â€

Not sure, if alcoholism is a bad thing.

Have these marijuana plants gotten bigger yet?

Drugs. Drugs. Consuming thems fine.

Take a couple Advil, wake up around nine. 

Oâ€™clock. Im in shock. Anxiety is frightening me. Has me ticking. Tick tock.

The time is near. One day Iâ€™ll over dose, and my mindâ€˜ll be clear. Free from depression and trauma.

I am a lama. Or is it a goat. Whatever it is Iâ€™m the best at smoke. Smoking. Coping, with my pain, by shoving toxins down my throat. 

My broken young brain. What havenâ€™t I wrote? Life sucks. My life is a joke. Iâ€™m a loser with more problems than cloaks.

To hide myself. My emotions, I croak. 
My pain with jokes. I die of a stroke. 

But that is fine. Because I want to die. Sorry everybody, but just look at my life.

Iâ€™m just going to end it now, have no time for goodbyes. I pull the trigger now. I fall back and I die. Finally at rest from all the shit in my life.
