Minorityâ€™s...? I donâ€™t get how someone whoâ€™s classed as a â€œminorityâ€ can be mean to another â€œminorityâ€
Like I seen this tweet and it said â€œif youâ€™re mad at white parents raising racist kids then also be mad at black parents raising homophobic kidsâ€ wasnâ€™t that exactly but it gets a good point across 

Like i donâ€™t get how people can be racist, sexist and or homophobic, â€œlike oh you like the same gender, ewâ€ like idk lol. I just find it weird and stupid 

Like what do you get out of being an asshole? Exactly nothing 

This probs didnâ€™t make sense but just wanted to share my thoughts
