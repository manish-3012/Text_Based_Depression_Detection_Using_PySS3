something for the guys So this is from a girl to you guys. I have seen so many memes and just plain sad posts on how guys never get compliments. every time I see one, well it makes me feel bad. How much I take for granted. Unfortunately, I can't give an accurate compliment from this side of the screen so I'm not going to try. However I will say this, you will find that someone who will compliment you daily. It might take a little while, it might happen sooner then you think, but it will happen. just keep up hope. it might suck right now, no matter how old you are, but it will get better.
