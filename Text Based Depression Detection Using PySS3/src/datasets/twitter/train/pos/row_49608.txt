sometimes i think i need a therapist but then i remember how i told my last one how great my life was, i love my family, no body issues, iâ€™m just thriving 2 days after i got out of the hospital bc of a suicide attempt at 12âœ¨ no need to mention all the previous ones and ones during the time i was in therapy. 

like itâ€™s weird telling a stranger about all ur problems... i mean yeah iâ€™ll rant to random stranger on the internet but then iâ€™ll ghost them and itâ€™s always anonymous anyway. 

maybe i just need more self medicatingðŸ˜¹
