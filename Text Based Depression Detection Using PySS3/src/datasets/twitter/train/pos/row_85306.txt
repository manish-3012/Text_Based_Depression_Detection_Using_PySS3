My crush asked me if I wanted to study with her I of course, accepted, and we met up at a coffee shop for a few hours. Then, she asked if I wanted to get lunch with her and her dad. Again, I excitedly accepted, blown away by how well this was going. 

Then, as we ate, she excitedly explained to the both of us how much she was looking forward to her date the next day, with a guy she met at work. 

Cue confusion noises from me. 
Anyway, I guess she just really likes hanging out with me, her friend!

(P.S. yâ€™all donâ€™t get black coffee it sucks)
