This is the dumb story of my first Twitter experience. A month ago, I met my first follower on Twitter, Karl. He was pretty nice to me. After about a week, he said that he liked me. I'm straight, so I said we should just be friends. He kept bugging me about it, but I just ignored him. Then, I met Kahoot. She was followed by friends of Karl, but I didn't think much of it. She was pretty nice to me, and immediately said a picture I took was cute. Before long, we were together, which was dumb, but I was dumb. I never got to meet her in real life, because she lived in California. One day, she was being kind of a jerk to me, which ended in us breaking up. I was pretty sad about it, but Karl was supportive. Another friend, Marcus said that he could hack into Kahoot's account, and proved it by sending hand signs. Karl then sent the same hand signs, while the others were still doing it. I was getting pretty suspicious at this point, and finally, Kahoot dmd, Its karl. I told him to stop reading our messages and to get out of the account, or I'd report him for hacking. Then, he said," how is it hacking if it's my account?" And admitted to being Kahoot. He thanked me for sending certain things. I was shocked at how someone could get someone to trust them for a month, only to see that they've been playing with you the entire time. I sent Twitter the entire thing, and it had all of the proof needed to get him banned. Of course, it's not even CLOSE to even, but I really wanted to share that painful story.
