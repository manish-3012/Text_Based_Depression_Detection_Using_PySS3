Questions about dudes and issues with body image (helping girls with their issues but realize I know very little about guys issues because Iâ€™m not one) Curious what issues you all face when dealing with self esteem and body confidence? I guess really anything youâ€™ve experienced relating to fitting in, feeling confident etc. Iâ€™d love to hear all sides of this. Iâ€™m working on a group discussion for girls in a group I have, Iâ€™d like to expand to doing this for guys too. 

Hereâ€™s some of what Iâ€™m curious about: 
- physical issues you face the most (what body issues are most common with guys)
- how do you deal with the way people body shame or joke about each otherâ€™s bodies (good or bad)
- how do you feel you are â€œsupposed to lookâ€?
- what does healthy look like to you? 
- what have you done to try and fit in
