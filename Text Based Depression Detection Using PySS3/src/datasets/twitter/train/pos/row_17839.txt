Gay teens, can you help me with my friend who is coming out? My very close friend needs help on how to come out to her parents because she is worried about how they might react. She lives with her aunt who is all for gay rights but her dad things her aunt is â€œinsaneâ€ which gives her pause.

Î‘ little bit of backstory: Iâ€™m a guy and I was the first she told about her thinking she might be gay Î± few weeks ago. I wholeheartedly supported her and congratulated her on this new chapter in her life but she does not know how to tell her parents and thinks she could get kicked out if she does it the wrong way.
