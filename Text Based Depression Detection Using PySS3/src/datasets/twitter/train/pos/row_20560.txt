What I say in the shower.... Gollum: "What's it saying, my precious, my love? Is SmÃ©agol losing his nerve?" 

SmÃ©agol: "No! Not! Never! SmÃ©agol hates nasty hobbitses! SmÃ©agol wants to see themâ€¦ dead!"

Gollum: "And we will. SmÃ©agol did it once. He can do it again."

SmÃ©agol: "It's ours! Ours! We must get the Precious! We must get It back!"

Gollum: "Patience! Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her."

SmÃ©agol: "We lead them to the winding stairs."

Gollum: "Yes, the stairs. And then?"

SmÃ©agol: "Up, up, up, up the stairs we go. And then we come to the tunnel."

Gollum: "And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs to feed."

Gollum: "She must eat. All she gets is filthy orcses."

SmÃ©agol: "And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?"

Gollum: "No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and empty clothes, then we will find It!"

SmÃ©agol: "And take it for me!"

Gollum (scoldingly): "For us."

SmÃ©agol (afraid): "Yes, we meant, we meant for us."

Gollum: "Gollum! Gollum! The Precious will be ours once the hobbitses are dead."
