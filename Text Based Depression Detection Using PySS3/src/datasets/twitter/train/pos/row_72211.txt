About Yandere Sim and Alex First off, I put it here instead of the official subreddit so it doesnâ€™t get deleted by Alex. Anyway, Iâ€™m thirteen (check my user flair) and yes, this is the REAL target demographic. So when even people my age realize this man is a liar, manipulator, etc. you know that itâ€™s bad. I found out about yandere sim maybe when it was 1 year into development. While I watched more and more updates, I realized heâ€™s adding less crucial mechanics than stupid ones. Itâ€™s been 6 years, and he doesnâ€™t have a save function. We have Corona-Chan, Ebola Chan, and tons of other stupid Easter eggs but no saves. Six years, and no first rival. Iâ€™m sure he is trying hard, but I think one way to get the rivals in is to focus on Osana for most of his development time. His patreon states â€œAnything over $1,000 will cause me to focus 100% of my attention on Yandere Simulator,â€ which is kind of inaccurate, since he has a 3 hour stream of gaming every day. Now thereâ€™s nothing wrong with playing games yourself when developing a game, but donâ€™t have it occupy 3 hours of time. Feel free to add on to this, make fun of it, criticize it, or anything else.
