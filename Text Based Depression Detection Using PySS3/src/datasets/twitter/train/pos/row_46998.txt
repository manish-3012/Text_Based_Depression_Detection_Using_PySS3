Friend advice So I have this friend who turns out to be a female. And she first asked me if I masturbate(since which I do) but I donâ€™t watch porn and masturbate because I feel porn is disrespecting women. Then later she texted me if I like a girlâ€™s boobs. Iâ€™m like no. She then said why do men fantasies about a girlâ€™s boobs. I then said that I like my crushâ€™s boobs(which is not the girl Iâ€™m mentioning here) she then now hates me because Iâ€™m not showing any respect to women(â€˜sheâ€™ is my friend). Iâ€™m like what the fuck. How do i salvage my friendship?? (Moreover she watched porn)
