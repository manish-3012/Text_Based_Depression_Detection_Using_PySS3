My bestfriend's birthday is today and she turned 18 And she lives in my city but is in her native city with her family due to Covid, so I called her at 12:00 am and she picked my call in one ring and let out an excited "hello!" And I went like "merry Christmas!!!".

Best. Day. Ever.

PS: Don't worry I wished her Happy Birthday after that lol
