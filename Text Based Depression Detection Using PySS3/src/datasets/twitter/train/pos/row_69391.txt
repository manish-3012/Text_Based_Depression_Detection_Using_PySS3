Da fuk is wrong with the people who made this song "I love it" by Lil pump and Kanye west.

It's like an 8th grader wrote this song and wrote all the swear words he knew and as many times as possible just to look cool.

The music is catchy tho.

I'm from India I rarely watch Indian music videos, let alone other countries'. But still this one... lol

I came to know about it from flyingkitty's YTP of it.
