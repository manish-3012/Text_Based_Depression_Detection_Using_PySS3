Weird Stuff Man So recently, something weird has been happening. Iâ€™ll think of something nostalgic like a video or a song or something and then later on that day, the song appears somewhere. 

Like last night, I was reminiscing on â€œoldâ€ music, like the parodies I used to listen too because they were hilarious. But I couldnâ€™t remember â€œBart Bakersâ€ name, but just now on reddit, someone made a comment about him and it sparked in my head.

Also Iâ€™ll just be thinking about something in my head and it will appear somehow the next day, like how if you talk about something near your phone and thereâ€™s a â€œyou might wantâ€ on Facebook or something and itâ€™s the thing you were talking about. Well it was like that, but I never mentioned it out loud.

Also something else Iâ€™ve noticed when Iâ€™m driving is people are terrible drivers, Iâ€™ve seen 3 people run stop signs within the past 2 day and it seems very repetitive, also people pull out in front of me and donâ€™t use blinkers occasionally, I know these are things that happen to everyone but recently, theyâ€™ve been happening more often.

But talking about the first 2. Thereâ€™s been multiple occasions where this has happened and I just find it really weird. Something Iâ€™m not used too
