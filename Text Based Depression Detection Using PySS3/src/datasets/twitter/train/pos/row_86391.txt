Idk how Iâ€™m gonna survive after the pandemic and life goes back to normal My social skills are so bad rn. Me and my mom went to Costco a few weekends ago and Iâ€™ve never been in a store with that many people in it. (Ik sad Iâ€™m from a relatively small place tho) and I got so fucking overwhelmed idk Man. Iâ€™m gonna look like such a dumbass when I have to talk to people face to face again
