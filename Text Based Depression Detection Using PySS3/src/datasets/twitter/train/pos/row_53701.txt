Itâ€™s honestly really hard to find a girlfriend or a boyfriend that actually cares about you. A part of it, or at least a I believe is the fact that I go heads over toes on Elder Scrolls and Fallout Lore. The lores interesting to me, but no one really shares that interest. You might be thinking that Iâ€™m narrowing down my expectations a little too much. And thatâ€™s a great point. I do like playing guitar, writing and researching history. Again, a pretty rare commodity to come across. Do they have to like the same things as me? No, absolutely not. My point is that itâ€™s hard finding someone that likes these among other things.

The problem is that I donâ€™t really see anyone truly caring for me. A relationship goes both ways, and yet there are people out there around my age who are just concerned about being clingy and having sex, the list goes on and on. 

When it comes to a partner, I want to be with someone who I enjoy spending time with. A friend, in a sort of way. A person that I care for and in turn, cares about me. I want to share beautiful experiences with that special someone, like decorating a Christmas tree together, or being the little spoon. Experiences like that is what I want.

But alas, my poor charisma wench-self makes it that I canâ€™t find my princess and yatayatayata, you get the point.
