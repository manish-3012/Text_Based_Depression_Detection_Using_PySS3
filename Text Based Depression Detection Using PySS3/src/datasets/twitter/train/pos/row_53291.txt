Vent post the third It's currently 1:57am as I'm writing this and I can't sleep , I've been alone with my thought for too long and i hate it , this happens to be a continuation from my last vent post also so if things dont make sense and you actually care go read that 

I hate jealousy , specifically my own. I hate that thinking about the person i love having fun with anyone but me makes my stomach tie in knots and ruins my mood , as much as I find their laugh adorable I hate it when it's not because of me. I have no rights to them, no reason to be jealous and yet here I am , they're allowed to do whatever they want with whoever that want and I despise it , I just want them to be mine but its outright impossible , I was almost starting to get over them the other day but then they kissed me on the forehead and it ruined it, I dont think I'm going to be able to get over them now but I want to more than anything in the world , I hate having one sided love , they know how jealous I am and why I'm jealous but they still say stuff that makes me feel like shit , knowing full well how much it hurts. I was in a group call with them and a couple other people earlier and they started talking to someone we just added to our friend group and they laughed so hard and one of our new friends jokes and I hated it , I wanted to leave the call so I could throw up and cry, I want to be the one to make them happy like that and nobody else, me , just me. Theres nothing stopping them from going and kissing someone and telling me all about it and it fills me with so much anger and dread that I want to puke because I know that if they were going to get with anyone it isn't going to be me since even before I had feelings I knew that they loved someone else as much as I love them. I just want to keep them with me forever , to hold them in my arms and never let go. Everything in the world could burn down around me and as long as they were okay by the end of it all I'd be fine with it. Earlier on they made a joke about sending one of our friends Lewds and I hated it , outloud I told our friend to deny them or I'd be upset with him but I dont have any right to say that because the person I love doesnt belong to me or to anyone. At this point I think the only way I'm getting over them Is by pretending they dont exist for a while but since they can't handle anyone ignoring them or they shut down I can't do that , I want him to be happy more than I want my pain to stop but I just can't take it anymore , I just wish they were mine and mine alone , nobody else could have them , only me.

The reason I hate my jealousy so much is because I've got no right to be jealous, the person I have feelings for doesnt belong to me just because I love them , I'm not allowed to want them all to myself because that's selfish and I dont own them , but even as toxic and disgusting as it is it's still how I feel and I hate it , I want my skin to shrivel and dry up , it feels like its burning and I want it gone , I need a release somehow but I promised them that I woudln't self harm , I've only got pent up filthy and toxic feelings and no way to expel them so they just manifest and grow and mutate and I can't stand it anymore

I wish they loved me as much as I love them , i wish they realised how much I do love them , i wish they'd stop calling me a simp as a joke because it makes me feel like my love for them even without my indescribable jealousy is fake and superficial , it's not fake , it's how I feel , I dont want to have to forget about the feelings i have but i just dont want to be in pain like this anymore , I want the one I love more than anything to love me back even a little bit in the same way , 

If only I didnt promise not to hurt myself , if only i hadn't fallen in love , if only i didnt have my disgusting jealousy then itd all be okay
