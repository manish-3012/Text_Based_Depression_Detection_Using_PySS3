What to do when you feel like dying I told my best friend I cut myself

She struggles with mental health issues and I feel awful opening up to her 

I feel like shit, itâ€™s 11:10, no one is awake and I need someone to talk to and sheâ€™s the only one  I trust but I feel like even more shit telling her exactly what she got over is what Iâ€™m dealing with now. 

I feel like Iâ€™m vibrating. Not good. 

Telling her that isnâ€™t my problem. I just feel like shit and my cutting used to get me through a couple days but I feel like shit every day and itâ€™s not helping anymore

Before anyone dms me, I appreciate it, but talking online doesnâ€™t really help me. I need like irl physical support
