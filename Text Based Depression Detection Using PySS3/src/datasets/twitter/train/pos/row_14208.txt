At this point, idk i'm not sad, i'm not angry, i'm not depressed, i'm just... here??? i guess???

I don't know why. Why am i still breathing? Is there a reason? Will i have a bright future? Will i achieve goos things? Becouse, at this point, idk anymore.

Everyday looks the same day. I just keep doing the same things, keep learning stupid useless things on school and for what?

If the "other side" is so good and all, why can't i skip to it?

I think quarentine is getting into my head, but is it bad? Is it bad to ask WHY? Why did I had to go thro that shit, why did that happened to me? Why, what is the reason behind that? why? why? why?

I don't have a job, and don't have to worry about much things tbh and i'm still breathing so i think that's cool. But why?

I think i need to find the right person to complete me or maybe i don't. Idk

i'm sorry to anyone who had to read this i just idk
