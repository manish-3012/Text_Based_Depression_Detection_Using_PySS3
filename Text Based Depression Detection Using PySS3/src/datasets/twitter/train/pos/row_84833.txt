How to get a bf/gf Dose it matter what gender i am? Ha! Nope.
Let me tell you something, you may like someone they dont like you. And thats ok, thats life.

Dont try to be someone your not because in the end you want to be someone who loves you for you. We, as humans will fail at this a few times and then we find the right person.

Be yourself :)
Even if your like me and slightly mad!
It dosent matter be who you are, who you want to be
