I've almost stopped trying at school What's the point of trying? The pandemic has taken all my goals from me. We're in the middle of the largest world economic collapse in history. I feel like there's just no point. On top of that, I've lost nearly all my friends. I have no idea what the future holds, but I know I'll have it rough.
