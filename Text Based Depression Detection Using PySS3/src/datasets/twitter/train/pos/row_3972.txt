Weird dreams last night Man I had a weird dream, there was this weird demon thing that kept trying to get into my house

It had a human face, and short orange tentacles it crawled around with. It kept trying to get inside and I had to hold the door shut

And several dreams about this weird other world that happened where people would just be pulled away and usually killed by an identical version of themselves, and if not that the other world would consume them in some way
It was either a phone screen or a window, and there would be yellow film on it that felt sort of like going through thicker water 

I never saw the other world, just the way the people in the dreams interacted with it

The first was a blonde woman, her copy killed her and took her place. 

Another was a couple with a child, when one discovered the other world theyâ€™d spend all their time messing with it. They had just moved into a new home, the other partner became disheartened after the other was spending 90% of their time using the other world. He then realizes the baby was from the other world and then when he goes to their room, both are gone. 

There was one more where two people were testing out the other world in a yellow room similar to the yellow film on the windows and screens, a man says he has second thoughts but both are soon pulled in. 


Any idea what these mean?
