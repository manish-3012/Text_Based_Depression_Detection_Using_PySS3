I had, to date, the weirdest dream of all time Basically it was the end of the world and the sun was about to die out and then me and three of my friends, people iâ€™ve never met before, weâ€™re running a real life strike from Destiny 2 like we were in fucking jumanji except everything was frozen because the earth was freezing over and just as we were about to die I woke up

wtf
