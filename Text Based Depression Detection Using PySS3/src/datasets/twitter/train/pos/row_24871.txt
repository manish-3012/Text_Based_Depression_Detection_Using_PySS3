I can genuinely say Iâ€™m happy right now For the past few days Iâ€™ve kinda been in this slump and count get out. But Iâ€™m genuinely happy rn, like smiling!! I watched a good movie with my mom. My stepdad got his first deer for the season. I got to remove all the hide almost by myself. I EVEN GOT TO BREAK THE HEAD OFF!! Low key pretty satisfying. Now Iâ€™m listening to Emilyâ€™s playlist and fixing a mask I made. Iâ€™ve been needing to do it for awhile lol. And Iâ€™m going to try embroidery again!! Hopefully my left arm will let me lol
