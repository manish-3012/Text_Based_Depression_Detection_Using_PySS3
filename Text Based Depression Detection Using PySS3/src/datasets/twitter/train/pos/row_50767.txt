Iâ€™m trying to reach as much people as I can If youâ€™re Not a kpop stan youâ€™ll probably not understand
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-
So kpop stans, what is your opinion on the s3xual assault scandal, who do you think is involved? As far as I know the idols who have been accused of drugging and s3xually assaulting women are:
Woojin- former Stray kids
Jungwoo, Jaehyun- NCT
Chanyeol- Exo
Seonghwa, Hongjoong- Ateez
Mingyu- Seventeen 

I, myself donâ€™t believe all of them had something to do with that and most of them are just accused by some haters. I donâ€™t have an opinion on the Woojin situation yet.
