Call me a stereotype all you want, but I fucking hate people who have a social life and I would indeed call them â€œnormiesâ€. I have noticed that people who have friends irl only trust others who also have friends. Whenever I seem to do something wrong they just fucking leave me and tell me how horrible I am even though I have no fucking idea how. When I tell them I donâ€™t know how friends work they just say I make excuses and that I have too little â€œsocial skillsâ€. Honestly decided that Iâ€™ll be extremely anti-social and just start getting mad at normies who have social lives. And also Iâ€™m especially sick of people talking about their friends and going to hangout or whatever the fuck it is. Iâ€™m not hearing that cancerous shit anymore Iâ€™m fucking done with you normies who do that.
