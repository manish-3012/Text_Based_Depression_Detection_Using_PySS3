Therapy session... 7 Halo people from today's new, the almost 0 people that comment to this kind of posts, it is that type of the day when I  your therapist.
 First thing first, I am NOT classified in this, but it is better to talk with someone than to suffer in the corner. Or you just can't go to a real therapist or you don't want to talk with your parents due to specificc reasons. I am here to listen to ya all.
Oh, and also, yesterday I said I will do 2 but I did only one, sorry.
And to be sure, I won't always have an answer when you ask becouse I will get more research in that topic if I need so it may take up to 2 days or, the worst case that that didn't happened yet, even 3
Just DM me
