Is it weird as a teenage girl but the people I get along with Best are grown men I am one of the rare girls on Reddit but I am a huge Star Wars fan and I love comic books and avatar and all that sort of thing so it means that I relate best to boys who were teens in the 90s and early 2000s I am a 15-year-old girl and people who I relate to most on between the age of 19 and 25, is that weird?
