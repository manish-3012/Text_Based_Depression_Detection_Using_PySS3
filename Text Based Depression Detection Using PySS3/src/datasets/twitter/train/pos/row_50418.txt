I always forget people can't see my face when I'm wearing a mask So I have this "apologetic smile" that I use when I'm in public. Basically, if I bump into a stranger or we have an awkward moment, I give them this embarrassed-looking smile as a way to say, "sorry" or "it's alright" or "excuse me." 

But that doesn't work anymore, because every time I try to smile in public, I'm wearing a mask and forget that people can't see me smile. So instead of seeing me smile apologetically, complete strangers just see me staring at them after they apologize or I accidentally did something rude. Then by the time I remember they can't see my mouth and try to say something, they've already left or the moment has passed.

Does anyone else have this problem, or is it just me?
