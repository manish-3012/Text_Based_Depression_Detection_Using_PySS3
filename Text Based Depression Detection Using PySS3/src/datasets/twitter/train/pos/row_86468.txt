There's this one girl I like A fee months back I have met a really nice girl while chilling with my friends. And I now have a crush on her. But I'm to insecure to ask because I'm scared that if I would ask her and I would get rejected I would never be brave enough to hang out with her again. This is because it would be so much cringe. And I'm to afraid to ask because I think she will reject me. Any advice?
