Mom is a teenager. anyone else? Mom is a 53 years old, but sheâ€™s been living with her parents till like 47 and then next to them since then. Iâ€™m 17 and end up giving my mom relationship and life advice, where she has given me next to none. My mom has raised me and loved me, for that I am grateful but she hasnâ€™t taught me anything. My mom is so fricking toxic and immature in relationships and sheâ€™s been in 4 in total. My mom believes in soul mates. My mom thought a guy she met online on Facebook was her soulmate after never meeting. Iâ€™m 90% sure the guy was just looking for some fun and my mom thought it was more than it was but she still to this day hasnâ€™t told him what her problem was. BUT Whatâ€™s worse is she after the honeymoon 1st month had issues in the relationship like a lack of commitment on his part, like they donâ€™t message everyday. My mom wanted to talk to the dude everyday like EVERYDAY online. When they didnâ€™t she got sad and worried, where I would have to comfort her after 6 months the dude broke it off.  My mom refuses to be self critical, she was adamant that this dude was her soulmate. This is more of a rant, i donâ€™t hate my mom I just wish she could of been more of a adult or grown up. I just wish at 17 she could of taught what it takes to be an adult, I wish I could of learned anything from her. My mom is a teacher yet canâ€™t teach me anything without tearing me down. Rant over.  Anyone else got some similar stories to share about a parent or parents?

Edit: dad died at 14 was pretty verbally abusive, they got divorced when I was like 3 but Iâ€™ve loss so much trust in my mom, that I can see where my dad was coming from in a lot of ways, he tried to teach me discipline when my mom just didnâ€™t, because of that not trying to blame her but I became it was only at 16 I got out of it without her help. The thing is I know my mom has some deeply rooted problems after a rough go at life so far but I just feel tired and needed to vent.
