um help OK so Iâ€™ve been straight for most of my life 
but last year, my freshman year, I started going to an all girls school, and I started noticing that I was staring at girls
iâ€™ve always known that I found girls attractive but I just thought that was like a girl thing, I find guys very attractive as well, but Iâ€™ve dated more guys but I have kissed more girls
itâ€™s like 60% for the guys and 40% for the girls 
I like first notice freshman year that I was like actually staring at women because when a really pretty girl came up to me and she told me that my hair was super pretty and I looked really cute today it literally blew my mind (itâ€™s happened with guys and iâ€™m used to it with them but thatâ€™s guys itâ€™s different if a girl does it)
so my question is does this make me bi even though I havenâ€™t dated any girls or does it make me bi curious?
