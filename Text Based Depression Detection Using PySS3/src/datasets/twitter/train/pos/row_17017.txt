Been fighting demons recently. Anyone else? My mind is so fucked up from all this stress, I want it to end. I'm not killing myself. Definitely thought about how easy it can be for eveything to just stop but no, i got so much to prove. So much to do. So much potential. I know I'm on top. 

But damn does it sometimes feel like i wont be anything in life even though I get better at something everyday but my brain never thinks it's enough, never wants to give it time. Doesn't understand that you can't be a pro at something in 24 hours.

Anyways, I didnt really plan to write anything, it was supposed to be only the title but I guess I just wanted to rant somewhere.
