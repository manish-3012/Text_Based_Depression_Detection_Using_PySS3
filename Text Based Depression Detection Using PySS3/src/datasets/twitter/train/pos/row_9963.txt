I'm posting it third time because it's ignored everytime. So, feedback on my poem? *Mother Nature*

The more , the merrier

Quite  erroneous for us? 

Presenting nothing , making the demon scarier  

It's time to go back to square one 

To have things done , Since we are one

Quit the parsimoniousness , consider the mother 

Martriach  expelling the class as of half halfwits seems near.  -  Me
