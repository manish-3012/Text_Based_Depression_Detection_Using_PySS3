God I want teenage boys to shut up about â€œoh I girlfriend, never heard of thatâ€ Like, god damn, we get it, your lonely. Youâ€™d probably be less lonely if your only sense of humor surpassed reddit meme quotes and self loathing. If someone says â€œI got a gfâ€ just say congrats or some shit and move on, donâ€™t be all like â€œhur dur get ready to wake upâ€ â€œlmao whatâ€™s thatâ€

Just get over yourself god damn.

Sorry yâ€™all.
