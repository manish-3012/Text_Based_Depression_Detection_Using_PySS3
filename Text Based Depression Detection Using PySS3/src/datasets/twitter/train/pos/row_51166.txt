What to do with your opinions. Recently I posted an idea that had been floating in my head for a long time now on r/changemyviewpoint . (Itâ€™s settled now so I wonâ€™t respond to anything.)

But online discussion is a great way to  work through ideas and opinions, especially when the main goal of the audience is to critique your argument and cite inconsistencies.

And itâ€™s best to get through all of that while hidden and anonymous behind a screen than doing so in front of a person in the physical world.

Just my two cents.
