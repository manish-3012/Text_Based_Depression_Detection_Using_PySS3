i hate having crushes had a crush on a girl for a long time (i knew she didn't like me so i also new it was never turning into a relationship) and this crush was finally over about a month ago. i go on a vacation, hang out with some people, and i think i have a new crush, who I'm also not going to be in a relationship with because I'm probably not seeing her again. i fcking hate having crushes even though it can be nice to think about a girl you like.

thanks for reading my rant
