It's kinda wack how 11 year old me wouldn't hate current me but 12-13 year old me would. I used to be such a mean person that hated people for stupid reasons. There's still traces of that terrible person in how I think and I hate it. I'm on my way to becoming better and I thankfully have, but the first thing I think in response to some things are dumb and hateful thoughts and while those thoughts never last longer than a second I still don't like that they're the first things I think.
