I need a friend so fucking bad Sometimes ppl come up to me and ask me are you alright
And I say yeah Iâ€™m alright.but really I should say Iâ€™m not fine
I mean I live by fear .to scared to go up to the girls on my class and introduce myself
(Most boys are awful friends here where I live) 
But honestly people donâ€™t like me .and I understand 
I mean I wouldnâ€™t wanna be friends with that weird kid at the back wich only speaks every once in a while and always wears dark hoodies 

Some people just think I need space but I donâ€™t and it just makes me burn inside even more
Because they leave me alone and it hurts me . 
This people is the ones that I want to be friends with 

Other people just find me perfect for bullying 
And make fun of me whenever they can 
They are not very annoying bc who cares if they make jokes about me 
I couldnâ€™t care less 

Other people just donâ€™t know I exist 
They live so on their own world that they donâ€™t see me 
I donâ€™t give a fuck about these people neither
Bc they are too â€œhappyâ€ like too unserious 
The classic people who would tell you â€œjust be happyâ€

I know what yâ€™all gonna say in. The comments 
That I should ask them if I can be friends with them 
But I am WAY too scared .  And I mean I know I should get Rid of it but I am too socially awkward and anxious that I just canâ€™t  .Maybe Iâ€™ll just link the post and send it to them 
But I doubt theyâ€™ll read it anyway 
I mean probably most people in this sub wonâ€™t 
And  even if they would 
I doubt they will change
