Anyone else with ADHD find it easier to write on graph paper with one letter in each box rather than lined notebook paper? I mean, itâ€™s the only way I can focus and actually write a paper, but it takes multiple papers due to the extra spacing and teachers hate it because itâ€™s hard for them to read.
