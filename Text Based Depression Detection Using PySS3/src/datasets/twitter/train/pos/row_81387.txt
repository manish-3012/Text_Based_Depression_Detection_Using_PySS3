Is my life a lie? So for a bit of context, i am 15 biological male, and my problem is that i dont know if i identify as trans because. Since i was maybe 12 or so i thought i didnt feel like a male and realized like a couple months later that i was trans and ever since i have been telling my closest friends that i am trans, but the thing is i kind of want to be both but i cant really tell my friends that i identify as both because they'll laugh at me. They're kind of some jokesters. And i've already told my parents. What should i do?
