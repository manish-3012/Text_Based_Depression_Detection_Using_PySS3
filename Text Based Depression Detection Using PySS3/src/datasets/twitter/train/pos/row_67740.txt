How do I get a girls number? (BIG POST WARNING) I (16M) made a promise to myself that I'd figure out how to get into a relationship with a girl. I met a girl in science class on the first day back of Q3. I had quickly developed a massive crush on her. Week 1 and 2 I gathered enough courage to sit down at the table she's at and I've done my best with small talk. She seems to like talking with me and I'm wanting to get her number and possibly hang out with her some time but I don't know how to ask her. If anyone has any tips on when would be either good ways to gauge she has the same feelings I do or how to go about asking for her number I'd really appreciate any help you can give me.
