I'm having a hard time [TW Suicide] I've been struggling with a lot of things here recently... I figured I'd be dead by now. I don't know what to do anymore. I have no plans. No dreams. No aspirations. How am I supposed to know what I want if all I can think about is something happening to me to take my life? I don't want to go out of my way to hurt myself, buti just keep hoping something happens to do it for me. So that I'm not to blame for hurting the people in my life. I'm so afraid of the future. I'm afraid of not having a plan. I just wish I had something to want to keep going for...
