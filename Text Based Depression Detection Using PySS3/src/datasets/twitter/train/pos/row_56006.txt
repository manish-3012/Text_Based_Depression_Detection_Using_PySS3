Fuck life man Covid can go up its ass ngl my crush just invited me to her friend group with the nice kids in school when lockdowns over. How long is that going to be? A month? 6 months? A year? I don't understand all the people loving lockdown. First was amazing but this? No, it's the most horrible experience. I just turned into a teenager. I don't want to waste 'tge best years of my life' stuck inside if my fucking house doing shit online school failing classes left and right. I'm sick of it. If this goes on for much longer people are going to be dropping by like fucking flies. I was so happy before covid. Finally getting a social life. But all of it's gone now because of one measly disease? I don't trust the vaccine, it's too early. I don't want to be 15 getting out of lockdown. Fuck that shit.
