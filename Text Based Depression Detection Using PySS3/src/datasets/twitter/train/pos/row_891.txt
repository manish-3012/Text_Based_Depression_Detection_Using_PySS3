The Last Drop - A Short Story      It was a Friday Afternoon, and the sun began to set.

     I had let my lawn mover and leaf blower begin to fully rest.

     I had tended to my lawn after feeling fully accomplished.

     But little did I know there was a urge my body hadnâ€™t abolished.

     While I thought I was given time to relax...

     My bladder had something, to extract.

     With the sudden urge to release this fluid...

    I ran to the lavatory with no genders excluded.

     After reaching the bathroom, I shut the door behind me.

     I pulled down my pants, all the way past my hiney.

     I relieved myself in a clear-yellowish like stream.

     So comforting and fresh, just like in a midnightâ€™s dream.

     As I finished It all up fashionably.

     I went up, down, left, right, and diagonally.

     I shook it all off with the thought of it to stop.

     But little did I know... it was not the last drop.
