Lets be honest, lalahha's mother Like... posted that their mother died. No long text or anything, just "she was funny". His account is less than a month old and he posted comments ranting about the size of anime girls tits in hentai subreddits -6 days ago (after his mom 'died') Literally complaining that a characters boobs were too small


Who would actually go on rants about something like that after their mother died? He literally said '**** horny boy' to someone in a hentai subreddit. How can you guys keep falling for stuff like this?
