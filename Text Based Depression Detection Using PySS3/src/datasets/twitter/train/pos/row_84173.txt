Do they exist? Hey guys a little background, so I started reddit a few months ago. And from the day I started I've been enlightened by the power of memes. After spending time in reddit now I think my IQ has increased exponentially. However, for the last few days... A question has plagued my mind which I am unable to grasp. I searched through reddit but I was met with only one answer. So I want to give you guys a try too. So, do girls like really exist?















More importantly: If they do, why do they always get a boyfriend that's never you even though you always want them to laugh and sent them funny "small pp" memes *snif* why?! .
