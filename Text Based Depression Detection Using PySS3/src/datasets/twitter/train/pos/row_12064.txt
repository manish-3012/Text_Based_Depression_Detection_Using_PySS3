My parents are nuts. They still expect trump to win the election... Yep, even though Biden has already clearly won. They think trump will still somehow be re-elected despite losing the popular and electoral vote. 

They were saving a candy bar with a trump 2020 wrapper on it for when trump wins and I threw away the trump wrapper because I thought it'd be funny. Now they're mad at me and my mom dug it out of the trash. Fuck my life.
