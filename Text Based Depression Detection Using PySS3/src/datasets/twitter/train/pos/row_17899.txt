No no no no no. I'm going back to school in 5 days or so and I'm not ready about anything. I just want to lay in a corner and cry I didn't realize it was this soon...



Highschool is literally hell on earth



During the quarantaine I couldn't bring myself to work  and I missed a lot of lessons. Some of them will be required for this school year.



During the holiday I couldn't do anything other than laying in my bed being depressed and anxious about school. I tried to work but I just couldn't do it



I wanted to learn japanese during my free time but I just wasted months doing absolutely nothing



I hate highschool so much, I am forced to be "friends" with people that hate me, and that I hate. I don't get along with anyone and on top of that I have social anxiety



All the teachers suck in my school.



And I can't even get "good enough" grades because I have excellent grades, so I will be forced to work to keep them (but I have skipped a lot of classes during quarantine)
