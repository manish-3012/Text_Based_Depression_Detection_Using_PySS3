Success with patience I met this amazing girl online, the only problem is we live across the world. I live in the USA she lives in Argentina. My parents have never liked me hanging out with girls much but they actually like her. The thing is..... we want to meet, like really badly. Like I worked my butt off for 3 months doing odd jobs so I could pay for flights to go there. I have most of the money now and am trying to find ways to make the rest ( I cannot get a job because I am incredibly committed to the sport I play). And to add to all the stress of this, I need someone to take me. My parents wonâ€™t let my 18 year old sister take me and my mom doesnâ€™t want to go. And then my dad would take me but I need to pay for everything (last year((this is going to sound fake itâ€™s not I swear)) my house burned down on my 16 birthday and we are fighting our insurance company bc they arenâ€™t giving us the money we were promised) which would be incredibly difficult for me. Iâ€™m actually in love with this girl and before you say I canâ€™t bc weâ€™ve never met, your wrong.... dead wrong. Weâ€™ve spent almost every single night in quarantine FaceTiming all night. Just wanted to tell my story, needed to vent even tho this will get lost in new.
