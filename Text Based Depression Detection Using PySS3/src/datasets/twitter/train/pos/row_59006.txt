I canâ€™t eat Mac and cheese anymore Yeah it sounds stupid and itâ€™s a very small thing but I canâ€™t eat Mac and cheese anymore.
Without going into much detail, I was played by a girl. It hit me really hard. Currently Iâ€™m at a point where everything I see makes me think of her. One of those things being Mac and cheese. If I see it or eat it, it makes me think of her, I get sad, and I completely lose my appetite. 

I really wish it would go away so I could do the things I used to love to do. Sadly, from prior experience, I realize it wonâ€™t go away until I meet someone new and forget about her.
