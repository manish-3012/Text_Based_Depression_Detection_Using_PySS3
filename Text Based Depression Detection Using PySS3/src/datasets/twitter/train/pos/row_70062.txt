Did ya'll know there were engagement rings for men? I mean I feel stupid cause duh it makes sense for there to be engagement rings for men, but like I found some SUPER COOL ONES. 

I've always imagined that I would be the one to propose in any of my relationships, whether I end up with a guy or a gal. So I was curious and started thinking, well do you think they have some cute rings for guys?

I found these like awesome stone rings, one of my favorites was this black ring with like streams of gold running through it. Like this is so cool!
