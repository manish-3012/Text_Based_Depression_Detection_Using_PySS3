Its my birthday Canâ€™t believe that was a year it felt like a month if that, its so weird. Its 5:30 all my friends noticed i fell asleep on the call (my sleep cycle is fucked) so they stayed up and all said happy birthday. Even if its small im quite happy they did it. Now im going to go watch the office and wait 5 hours for them to wake up. 



Ps its james mays birthday.
