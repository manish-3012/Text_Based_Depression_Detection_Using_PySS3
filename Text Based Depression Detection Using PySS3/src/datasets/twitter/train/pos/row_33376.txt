How would I go about telling my parents that I think I'm depressed? I did some research, and I'm 90% certain I have moderate to severe depression. I would like to get help, but the only real way would be for me to tell my parents about it, and I don't want them to freak out. They freak out about everything, and I wouldn't say I have the best relationship with them. Definitely not the worst, but not the best either. Any advice?
