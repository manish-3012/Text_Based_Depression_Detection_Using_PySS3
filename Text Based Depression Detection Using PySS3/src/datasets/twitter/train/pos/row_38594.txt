iâ€™m really proud of myself !! so i started learning korean in march and then after like a month i kind of lost motivation and my online classes got in the way but in the past 2 months iâ€™ve started studying it more and more and iâ€™ve made so much progress itâ€™s actually unbelievable like iâ€™m so proud of myself. i really want to be fluent in korean and live in south korea when iâ€™m older, so this is my motivation to not give up. 

a lot of people say that korean is really hard and almost impossible to learn, but in my opinion as challenging as it is, itâ€™s quite easy and fun to learn. but that might be because i already know 3 languages so idk. but anyways iâ€™m super proud of myself :)
