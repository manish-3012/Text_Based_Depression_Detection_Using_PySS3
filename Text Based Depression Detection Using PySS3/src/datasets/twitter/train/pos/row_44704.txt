People who threaten to kill themselves over reddit are assholes. We've all seen the 'if my gf doesnt accept my proposal at 15 then im gonna kill myself' type of post. If you post something like that you are sure she will not accept you and are doing it just to pity others. There's no super woman gonna come out the screen and marry you on the spot just because you said 'guyz imma kill myself bye'.
