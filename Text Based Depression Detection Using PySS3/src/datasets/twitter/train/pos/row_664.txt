I think Iâ€™m falling in love for the first time pretty much ever I dont think that this is a highschool delusion too, I think Iâ€™ve legitimately met someone I could spend the rest of my life with. It really sucks that I met her now and not like in college but you never know. Ive known this girl about three weeks now and we have connected so well and talked so much that itâ€™s crazy. But blah blah blah Iâ€™m in love, really hope this works out haha.
