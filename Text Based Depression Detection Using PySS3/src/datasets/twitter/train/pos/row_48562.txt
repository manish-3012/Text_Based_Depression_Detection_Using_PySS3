Quick question Iâ€™m interested in this one girl though Iâ€™m not even sure if sheâ€™s interested. I responded to one of her Insta stories about cartoons by saying â€œCartoons rlly ainâ€™t the same anymore ðŸ˜”â€ with her replying two days later (few minutes ago) with â€œikk ðŸ¥ºâ€  so Iâ€™m wondering if I should try to carry it by asking what cartoons was she into as a kid. I donâ€™t even know rlly like Iâ€™m tempted to but at the same time ion know.
