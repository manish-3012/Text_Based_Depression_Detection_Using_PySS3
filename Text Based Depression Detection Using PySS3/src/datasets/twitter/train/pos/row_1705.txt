I just had the strangest reddit argument so far. So on my alt account I started a discussion about a game, and that one dude wrote an entire essay with Caps Lock and each other word being a swear insulting me. I barely understood it, but managed to make out his actual points and replied without being toxic. It went on, and Im pretty sure he broke his caps lock. Finally, someone backed me up, telling the guy to stop being unnecessarilly toxic. I replied to the nice guy and tagged the toxic one, saying it is good advice, and asking why was he toxic in the first place. He then replied and quoted Sun Tzus "Art of War" about using effifient tactics against enemies.

I'm not sure wether to laugh my ass off or be worried about him not being in aggression therapy.
