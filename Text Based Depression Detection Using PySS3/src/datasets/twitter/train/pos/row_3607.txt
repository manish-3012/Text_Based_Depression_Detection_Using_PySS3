My aunt and uncle's pride and joy just got killed by the storm My aunt Fran and uncle Pete are fantastic cooks. They bought a restaurant a few years ago and spent the past few months renovating it. Friday was supposed to be the grand reopening and they were so excited and although we don't live in the same state as them we were really excited too. Not even an hour ago a building literally FELL on their restaurant cause of the storm. Some gas tanks exploded and they're fine they weren't in the restaurant at the time but now they're jobless and can't do what they love. They're some of the nicest and best people in my family and they have the hardest luck and I wish I could trade mine for theirs. They really don't deserve this, especially in the middle of the virus. I wanna start a gofundme or something to raise money for them to buy out another place but my parents said to wait
