Being the odd friend I am different than my friends. With different I mean I am a year younger and a girl. And I hate it. I often feel left out because of those things I can't change about myself.
I'd personally say the first reason is worse. I just changed school because I got my graduation on my old school but I wanna get a higher graduation.
In every school I went to my friends were a year older than me so the last year of every school I spent alone. It was pretty hurting to see my friends making new experiences while I was stuck in the same place, all by myself. It might be possible that I developed an inferiority complex because of that. 
So I spent a majority of 4th grade and 10th grade crying. I'm scared that it'll be the same in 13th grade.

I know that it's gonna happen and I can't run away from it, I can't change it.
It's still two years until my friends graduate but it already bothers me so much.
Don't get me wrong I'm happy for them, I just don't want to be alone.
