Girls' expectations for boys So, I'm a girl and I see on r/memes a lot about girls wanting boys who are taller than 6 feet, need to be rich, etc. To the girls here - how do you have such high expectations? 

Honestly, I just want a boy who loves Minecraft and is not tall. I'm scared of tall people; I'm really short. And, if the stuff on r/memes is real(and I think it is, there are a lot of things from Twitter and Instagram), then just why? Honestly, why does it matter that you are taller than your boyfriend, or if he is short? And, if you were dating girls, would their height matter? Probably not! I just think girls are really stupid and I am ashamed to be the same gender as these people.

Sorry for the bad formatting and grammar, I failed English class. :D
