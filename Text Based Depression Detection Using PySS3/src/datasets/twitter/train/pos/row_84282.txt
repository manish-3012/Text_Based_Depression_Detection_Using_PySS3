I want to go to St. Maryâ€™s boarding school I have been looking at my chances of getting a decent education where I am in Arizona and Iâ€™ve found that I am seriously screwed here. I was looking at private schools up north and I found St. Maryâ€™s private school In Medford Oregon. I absolutely fell in love with the class choices, main ones being engineering, and aero space. I also love the campus. Now on to my problem. My family is a working class family. My mother just finished her college and is working. My dad is a heavy diesel mechanic. The tuition for this school this year alone is 57,000 dollars. Even with financial aid itâ€™d be 37,000 dollars. I really want to get a better head start for college and my education but after seeing how much it is Iâ€™ve kinda lost hope. I donâ€™t know what to do. I really want this but my family wonâ€™t even consider paying for it at all. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m not capable of being a straight A student itâ€™s that they donâ€™t want to put that type of money into my education. I know they wonâ€™t even pay for my college. Iâ€™d be going into 9th grade by the way. So I need some sort of advice here cause.
