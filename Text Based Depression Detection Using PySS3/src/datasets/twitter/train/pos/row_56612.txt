Need tips for police hearing So I got punched in the face about 6-8 times by a guy in my class, basically unprovoked I might add. The school reported him to the police and now I have to go to a police hearing. I am usually a calm and relaxed guy but this is making me nervous. I need tips on how to act and how to handle the situation.
