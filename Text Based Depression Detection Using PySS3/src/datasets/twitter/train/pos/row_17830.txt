I figured out how to cheat during a French presentation (ONLINE ONLY) If you're supposed to have your hands up while speaking, I have great news for you.

You need an external keyboard. Position said keyboard by your heel and turn on slow keys, then press the spacebar with your heel. It'll be delayed, but your speech sounds more genuine.

Trying this tomorrow. 99.9% sure I won't be caught. Also, make sure the text is on the central upper part of the screen (and turn on present mode). Then you'll be impossible to trace!
