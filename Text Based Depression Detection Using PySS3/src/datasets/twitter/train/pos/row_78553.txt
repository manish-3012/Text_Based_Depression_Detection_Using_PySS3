Recognise the madness within yourself Don't let it be contained so easily. Your imaginary friend, your incoherent babbling of words that have no discernable meaning. To be insane is to be a child, and to not be a child is a lie. Maturity is a rule people put on their selves and others to reject reality, the reality that their mind isn't as all together as they would like.

People look at me strangely, people crease their brows in disgust. I look at them with sadness, for I have my little freedom, the one which they couldn't accept for themselves
