(Buddy) from school said he wanted to go out on a date. Iâ€™m a guy and I ofc he is a guy, we are juniors and I think I met him in 6th grade. He is pretty cool, back then I knew he was gay because he came out to me in 7th grade. I supported him, and ig that made us closer friends, in HS we kinda went to our own factions but still stayed in touch. Yesterday tho we were texting and he called me. I answered and he said that I have been nice to him even when others werenâ€™t and he got all mushy and stuff lol, he asked me to go out with him. I paused because I was shocked. He kept calling my name and I FaceTimed him. I tried to let him down easy telling him I like girls. I am straight. (Donâ€™t get me wrong, for a guy he is a knockout when he goes to college he will definitely get looks) but I just wasnâ€™t attracted to him that way. He said ok. He looked pretty sad. We are friends first so I told him we should get some food at like a Burger King. He said ok but in a happier tone.
