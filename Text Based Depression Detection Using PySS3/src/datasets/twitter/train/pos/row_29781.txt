Ya know when your in class and kinda stop paying attention and then the teacher calls on you to answer something? And you donâ€™t know what the question was do you ask the teacher to repeat it and then they get mad at you for not paying attention?

What if instead of being a cunt and getting mad, they just repeated the question so I can have a shot at it. Its fucking hard to pay attention to boring shit 7 hours a day
