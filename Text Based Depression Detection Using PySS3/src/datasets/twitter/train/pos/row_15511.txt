funny how everyoneâ€™s accepting of ur mental health issues until you talk about it more than once iâ€™ve been feeling really emotionally unstable for the past week now and I hate crying over every minor inconvenience. ive been an over thinker my whole life and if you express your worry to other people more than once they just ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ get tired of it ðŸ˜º like donâ€™t put those shitty mental health positivity things on your story until youâ€™re actually willing to put up with others when their mental health is bad
