Having your parents think youâ€™re dating someone when youâ€™re not actually, even though you wish you were, is such an odd feeling Thereâ€™s this girl I really like who my parents think Iâ€™m dating. I get why they think that but weâ€™re not actually dating. I wish we were and itâ€™s weird when my parents make jokes about it and stuff because I wish we were dating. We met online and then one day her family moved to my city and so weâ€™ve been able to hang out irl. I donâ€™t know if she likes me back or anything but Iâ€™m too nervous to ask her out. Just wanted to share.
