I need help There's this girl in my class. We have hung out a couple of times but only in a group setting. We are not that close btw. She likes to talk about how different she is compared to other girls and even tho it is pretty annoying, I'm not letting it bother me because she isn't hurting anyone. 
The problem is, is that she talks about her depression a lot. I don't want to come off as rude or mean but I don't think she has is because she talks about it ALOT. I know that doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't have it but she's glorifying it and making it look like it's "cute" or "quirky". I wouldn't care if she talked about it or not if it wouldn't be so triggering to my friend and I. My friend told me that she can barely handel talking to her.
Idk what to do because this girl is nice and funny but it really bothers my friend and me. What do I do?
(Also thank you so much for reading all of that and sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes)
