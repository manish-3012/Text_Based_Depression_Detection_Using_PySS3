It should be mandatory for doctors to ask the patient specifically if they want their parents to leave the room I canâ€™t explain how much times I was embarrassed answering questions the doctors asked cause I didnâ€™t wanna tell him to ask my mom to leave the room. And i doubt someone with strict/religious/weird parents would openly admit they rawdogged with someone in-front of said parents. It will give a sense of privacy and more chances to have honest answers if they choose to have the parents away to prevent being pressured to lie to not get in trouble. And it might encourage them to explain their problems in more detail or actually talk about their problem with the doctor if they havenâ€™t already because of the parent in the room and them being scared to tell the doctor to have them leave. They should have a little board or note thingy and have u point to it without the parent seeing so it doesnâ€™t look like the patient wanted them out and more like a procedure. Maybe it can help patients get help they need without getting in trouble or being embarrassed from asking in-front of their parents. The note with 2 options that you point to will actually help with patients being shy to ask in-front of their parent. We need this to be an actual official thing, or maybe a small board on the wall not visible from where the parent is sitting so the patient can point to it discreetly when they have questions or want to explain something to the doctor in private.
