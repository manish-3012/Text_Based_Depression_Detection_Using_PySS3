My krush, again, sorry First, I'm bakk, ya gitz. 

But I went bakk to skhool yesterday after 6 months off. Turns out that I spoke with my krush more than anyone else during that 6 month period. 

Obviously that's a good thing. And maybe it puts me in with a better chanse when I ask her out at some point this month. 

And this time I WILL ask her out. No wussing out, no sidestepping. I WILL do it, and I'll see what happens. 

LONG LIVE THE KING
