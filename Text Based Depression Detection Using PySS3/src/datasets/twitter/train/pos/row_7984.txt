I told my crush how I really feel So yesterday me and my female friend were on a call.  I really like her, and she is the cutest thing to ever exist. Anyways it was really late, like 1 AM and we started getting really deep and spiritual, kind of like we were high but we were really just tired. She then asked if here was anyone in class that I liked. At first I decided to say no, but she asked if I was sure and I decided to shoot my shot.

And she told me that she liked me too! She said that she had liked me for a while, and that she was too shy to say so because she didnt think I liked her back. Anyways I am now the happiest i have ever been!
