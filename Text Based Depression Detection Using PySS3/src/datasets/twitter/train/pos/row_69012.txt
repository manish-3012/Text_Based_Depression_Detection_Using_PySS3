finally got a laptop!!! i finally got a laptop after a year and a half of nagging my dad for one. its not the best, and i sure as hell cant play a lot of games on it, but its still great. it can run CS:GO, but not *suuuuper* well, but i can do all the things i could do on my phone, and more, better. thx dad, for the awesome starter laptop!!!
