Is there is any school which gives you guarantee that you will become billionaire in future if you score A/A+ in all subjects? Ok, letâ€™s forget about billionaire, can they even give you guarantee that you will at least become a millionaire in future. According to me if you want to become a multi-millionaire then your teacher should also be a multi-millionaire. Because only a successful person can teach you how you can become successful in life. Just ask your teacher are they successful / are they financially free or they still wait for paycheque ? There are only 0.0001% of teachers who are really successful. This is the main reason why I think our school system should change. What are your thoughts share in comments.
