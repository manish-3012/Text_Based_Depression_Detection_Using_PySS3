crazy how good &amp; cool i am like i feel bad for people who have never met me or even talked to me theyâ€™re missing out fr. and like being friends with me is already a huge privilege but just think abt the person dating me? theyâ€™re so fucking lucky. they probably wake up everyday being thankful they have me and would never do anything to make me think they donâ€™t care abt me or hurt me. also imagine getting to fuck me? crazy shit tbh
