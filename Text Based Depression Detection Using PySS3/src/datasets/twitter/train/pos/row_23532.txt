I need genuine advice on what to do So basically I've liked a girl for a long time but she lives far, FAR away and doesn't date guys online (or that's what she told me at first) Anyway she told me she likes me back but not long after she started dating another guy and then she says "I date every guy that asks me out" that was a few months ago and she's dated 3 guys since then while telling me "I only have feelings for you" and one of them (the last one) was an online relationship that she claimed she doesn't do anymore. And as soon as she broke up with that guy she started dating another guy from school. 
I'm really inexperienced when it comes to stuff like this because I've liked like 2 girls I my entire life. What should I do? Because I've tried ignoring her but it's hard to just stop talking to her.
