I miss summer I had so much fun during summer. My grandparents and I came down from California and we stayed at my a family members house where weâ€™d always see all our family members and everyday weâ€™d do things. 

Iâ€™d also frequently go visit my parents in the state next to us and stay there half of the summer where my (soon to be step siblings) stayed for a month and weâ€™d hang out also much. It was so fun having sleep over downstairs. Weâ€™d also go drive around and do shit. 

I always cry because now things are different and Iâ€™m off to college 8 hours away and I donâ€™t see them anymore. And my family members returned back home so now everyone is separated again. 

RIP summer of 2020.
