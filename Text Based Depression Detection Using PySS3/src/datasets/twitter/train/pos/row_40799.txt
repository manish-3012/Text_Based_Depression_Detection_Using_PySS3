Yâ€™all I need advice on something So I was just chatting with this girl I met on Reddit a few days ago, she is really nice and sweet, she told me she was 18 and I beleived it. She sent me a video from her tiktok account so naturally I looked it up... turns out shes 20 and not 18 and she has a kid... should I call her out on it or just block her? Iâ€™m so confused lmao
