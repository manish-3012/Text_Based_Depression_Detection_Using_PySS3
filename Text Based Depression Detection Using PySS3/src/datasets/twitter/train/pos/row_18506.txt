im so mad because my dad said the reason i couldnt dye it blue was because " i would be unnatractive and he doesnt want to look at me" like its MY hair, why should he have any control whatsoever with whatt i do with it. Its not even like its going to affect any one so why get all pissy about it. And yes i get it, that "oh its just hair,  if he cares so much then just dont do it". And if he had a bloody legit8mate reason then, yeah, id step down. But NO, blue hair will make me unnatractive. Which btw, i know im fucking unnnatractive already and its just making me hate myself even more.
