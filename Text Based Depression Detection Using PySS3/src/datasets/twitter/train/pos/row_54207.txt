Random Discussion: What do you think of the F-15 Eagle/Strike Eagle? What do you think of the F-15? It's a nice bird with a high TWR which means it's good if not one of the best in BVR. The C version (Single Seat) is in DCS but it's a low fidelity module not to mention it doesn't have a data link nor JHMCS. Currently the F-15E Strike Eagle for DCS is still under development. So far a nice bird if you're askin me. It even killed a Satellite in Low Earth Orbit.   


just sayin
