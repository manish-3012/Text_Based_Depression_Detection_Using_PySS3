Hey I'm bored you wanna chat? Me too Title


Bored and want to try and find some friends since finding some at school seem unsuccessful. I like art, memes, games, aesthetic stuffs, spooky shit and other junk. Some of the music artists I like include Radiohead, GRLwood, pavement, sir chloe ando bratmobile, and many many others.

I'm also bad with social ques sometimes so sorry about that :']
