Why do all the exams have to be together Okay, so last week I had 2 exams had to present a presentation. Today I have 2 exams, history and literature, and then next week I have another 4 exams, one on monday of economy, two on tuesday of math and chemistry, and another history one on thursday. The worst part is that the for good damn history exams I have to study like 3 presentations of like 65 slides each. And I also have to finish 3 proyects, I have to write a TED Talk, yes a fucking TED Talk, I have to do another one of unemployment rate for economy, and another one for economy. And I can't fucking calm down.

And I've Also been doing fucking exams non stop since the good damn start of the month, for a whole fucking month. Why Can't they just space them out more. I'm fucking stressed.

Thank you for listening to my rant, I just has to venta out some steam.
