First "Date" suggestions please Aight so, there's this girl I talked about in my last post.... and I really want to ask her out in the near future, but I don't know what I should go and do with her.  I thought about grabbing coffee or going to dinner with her, but I think that it could turn awkward pretty quick if you don't have anything to talk about for a while. So maybe something with a bit more action????

Looking for suggestions from all of you lovely people, especially the girls :D

We are both around the age of 20 if that helps.
