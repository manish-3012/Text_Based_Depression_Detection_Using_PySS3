Hi, does anyone else have ADHD in this group and can never sleep? Itâ€™s crazy how i have so much energy still. 15m. So i have ADHD and i was wondering, does anyone else have it? Itâ€™s effecting school badly at the min and life in general. Iâ€™m taking Adderall, on the right times and i am never asleepðŸ˜‚. Iâ€™m suprised ADHD lets me have so much energy everyday. Itâ€™s crazy. Like, my eyes feel tired but the rest of me doesnâ€™t and i have constantly got the urge to get up and do something at like 2-3amðŸ˜‚. But itâ€™s also really hard meeting new people in person, or online for that matter if i donâ€™t tell them beforehand. I get sidetracked / distracted by the slightest thing and i forget everything i get told to do or my mind just goes blank or i canâ€™t speak orsomethingðŸ˜‚. But yeah. I guess it was a rant but a question at the same time? I donâ€™t even know. ThanksðŸ‘ðŸ¤˜ðŸ½
