ik its sorta unrelated I made a logo and I worked really hard and people hated on it. It was for this video thing I was working on and now that people are hating on it I am getting really demotivated. Literally I feel like it's unfair that people who I've never seen edit criticize me for something I'm not even doing seriously and something I am just doing for fun. Am I in the wrong here? Idk I feel like I might be in the wrong and I feel like I might be overreacting. I don't like advertising but I have the logo for the video/movie thing I am making on my profile.
