My friend is ditching me! I'm so freaking upset rn.One of my only friends in band is quiting. Our school just got a new band director this year and a lot of the kids are upset because she is more strict than our last one. Last year I had a few friends in this class, but all of them quit including the ones who told me to stay with them in band cuz they didn't want to be alone. So at the start of this year I was pretty much alone in band, but I got lucky when this one guy started talking to me. He's a brass player, so he sits in the back and I sit in the front because I'm a woodwind player. We talked while packing up and texted in class. He was the only person in this class I talked to because all the people who begged me to stay freaking quit. And now he's quiting too and I'm going to have no friends and be alone at pep band, concerts, and this class. I'm so upset about it especially because he doesn't understand why I would be upset. I'm even more pissed off about him not telling me this in advance. And just this week I've been comforting and helping him through his first break up. He had several chances to tell me, but instead he just left me high and dry. I feel so upset with him, but I don't want to get mad at him because he did nothing inherently wrong. Sorry if this bothers you I just needed to rant.
