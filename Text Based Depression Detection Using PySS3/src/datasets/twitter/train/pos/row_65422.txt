Confused about gf Please read!!! My girlfriend started acting weird out of no where and I wanted to see if something like this has happened to anyone of you with your SO. I sent her a Snapchat and she responded with a joke. Then directly under it she said that she has been feeling weird lately and might not text me for a while, her feelings are all weird and she doesnâ€™t wanna mess this up. I asked for details or what was happening and she said it was hard to explain. She said that it didnâ€™t have to do with me she thinks. Sheâ€™s just going to stop talking to people for a second. I said that I didnâ€™t understand what was happening and she said she didnâ€™t either. I then said I would give her as much time as she needs but just wanted to know that when she was ready to talk to me again we would be okay. She did not answer this question and simply stated that itâ€™s okay and that sheâ€™s okay. Then after I asked more questions she simply said I donâ€™t mean to sound mean but stop texting me. I then said Iâ€™m always her for you and stopped texting. Iâ€™m going to give her the space she clearly needs right now but Iâ€™m just scared. I donâ€™t know why this is happening or what I can do to help. Any comments or suggestions will be seriously appreciated. Thank you.
