What happened with tiktok? My fyp mainly consists of anime, lgbt, fuck trump and his stans, and mental health stuff. But I do see the stuff that a lot of people are talking  and complaining about. I donâ€™t get toxic videos, but I get people duetting them telling them how toxic theyâ€™re being. So I still see what everyoneâ€™s talking about but... how did this even happen? How did an app that started off with cosplaying and small dances end up like this.
