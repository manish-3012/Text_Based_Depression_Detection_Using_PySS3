Biggest plot twist in among us. I was playing among us solo. I spend the entire match with purple and throughout the match we find a few bodies.. we cover for each other. last meeting with only three people. I say "purple is innocent so it must be you." and vote Lime. He goes "if you vote me we lose. Purple says "Not for me." screen turns black to black to reveal he's the imposter. Literally shaking rn.
