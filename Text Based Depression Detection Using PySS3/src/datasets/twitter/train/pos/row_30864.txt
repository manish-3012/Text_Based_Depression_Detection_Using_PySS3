People who've been in and out of relationships, any advice on how to get over a past relationship? I've asked a similar question in the past nearly the day of a break up, but I still experience some PTSD-esque symptoms from my last relationship and it's starting to really bother me. Every time I think I'm done with it, just the mention of relationships or something else gets me thinking about it.
