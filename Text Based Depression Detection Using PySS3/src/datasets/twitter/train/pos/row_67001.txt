Are video games multimedia sources? I have to do a school comparative analysis essay on two multimedia or reading sources. I can't remember any books that I have read, and my only other choice, if I'm not convinced that video games are multimedia sources, is probably going to be analyzing two Jim Carrey movies or something else that I can enjoy. I was thinking I would compare two horror games or something with an actual story if that helps, like Outlast or something like that. I'm obviously not going to do something like Call of Duty or Fortnite or something that is multiplayer-based... Any advice or help is appreciated, thanks guys!
