Ignore this cringe post I just wanna scream into the void a bit Do you ever feel like jumping off a bridge ?? Cause I do right now, it feels physically painful to exist and it is so mentally exhausting ??  Idk I just didnâ€™t ask for any of this but here it is and Iâ€™m stuck with it ?? So many people tell me to get help, to go outside and stuff but like.. thatâ€™s not what I want, I really just wanna die. When people ask me what job I want to do in the future I literally cannot project, my life goal is ending it all, itâ€™s all my plans. I wish my mother didnâ€™t love me so I could just kill myself without having to inflict pain on someone else. I just want to go drown myself in my pool right now but Iâ€™m so afraid of not dying and having to go the hospital and stuff, and even if I succeed what will people think of me. My big sister will be the bright child who got everything done perfectly and Iâ€™m just the disaster who killed himself. Gosh Iâ€™m fucked up why am I so anxious, I would literally be dead why would I think of what people would think of me. I donâ€™t deserve anything I have, especially life.
