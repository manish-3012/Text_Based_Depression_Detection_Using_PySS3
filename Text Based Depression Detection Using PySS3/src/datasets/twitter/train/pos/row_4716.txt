Struggles of meeting someone you like for just one night. Few days ago I met a cute girl at a friend's party, but she lives like 30 km from me. We connected well and eventually made out but I think we both had the feeling it was just for one time, since we both wouldn't get the opportunity to see eachother more and... She apparantly cheated on her boyfriend by hooking up with me so I just feel shit ruining some guy's feelings... 
Still I feel somewhat emotionally attached to her and was wondering if others have went through the same thing sometime and what they did... because what better way to share your feelings than through strangers on the internet right??!!
