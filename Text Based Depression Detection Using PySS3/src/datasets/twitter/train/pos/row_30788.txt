Send help my parents are taking away my tech What does it take to tell them that, just maybe, THEREâ€™S A REASON WE USE THESE. Iâ€™ve learned more on my phone than all of middle school science has taught me so far (7th grade was fun and had labs at least). She says â€œBut (insert guy who used to be my friend who is now an acquaintance) has his scooter for a hobby! People who are constantly on tech have no life. Get a hobby outside!â€ Come on, my hobbies are D&amp;D, debate, and Warhammer. Iâ€™m not interested in stiff outside. And some of the most interesting people I know spend most of their lives on the internet. Would you say that Markiplier and Crankganeplays, creators of Unus Annus have no life?
Seriously people!
