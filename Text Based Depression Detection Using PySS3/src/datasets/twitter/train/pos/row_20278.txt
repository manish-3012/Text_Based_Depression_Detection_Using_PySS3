To those of you who have never experienced a migraine before Take a second to realize how lucky you are. This is death. I have experienced so many migraines in my life and my personal high score for throwing up in a day is around 8. I am currently experiencing one. I am going to have to lie down, nauseous, for the next hour after writing this.
Just please, if you've never had a migraine, take a moment to just appreciate that. Because they're one of the worst things ever. ~Jaidenanimations
