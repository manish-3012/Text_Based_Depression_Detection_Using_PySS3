I didnâ€™t think I was this gae. A few months ago I realized I was bi, and I sorta came out to myself. I thought I had a preference for guys, but I think Iâ€™m a bit more on the gae side now. I have some internalized homophobia, so realizing Iâ€™m bi, and figuring out my preference is actually girls, is stressing me out a bit. Anyways, boobs are hot, peace out.
