I have this really cool recipe for chai(Indian tea) that used to belong to my grandmother. Ingredients:

* 3 cardamon pods, crushed
* 1 star anise 
* Fresh, 1/2 inch knob of ginger(if you like tea that's gingery)
* Whole milk(Don't use skim milk it will taste very watery)
* Strong black tea

(it should take less than 6 min to make)

How 2 make the 'ea:

1. Crush cardamom pods if you haven't yet. Fetch your star anise too.
2. In a pot, pour equal parts water and milk and get it nice and bubbly
3. Slice the ginger into thin slices
4. Add everything to the pot except black tea
5. Keep a close watch on the pot, when bubbles start to form on the edges, then you put in 1 1/2 tablespoons of black tea.
6. Mix mixture around a bit. As the temperature of the tea rises, it should turn into an orangeish brown color. When that happens, simmer the tea for 3 minutes
7. Add some sugar to taste and mix. I always add in less than I need because I can always add sugar when the tea is in the cup
8. Strain tea into your vessel of choice(or not if you feel lazy)
9. Drink, tea goes well with a salty snack like a cold-cut sandwich or some biscuits. Don't burn your tongue too!
