I think im going to try it bois ive grown feelings to a girl im really close to.weve known each other since 8th grade (were sophomores now), i walk her home almost everyday, and the only thing we ever do is laugh when on the phone, and off. shes thrown off subtle hints that she likes me, such as saying she was mad at me for leaving her with our other 2 friends when i went to the doctors.What do you guys think? i might rake her to a beach date alone so we can dance and hang out in a few weeks.
