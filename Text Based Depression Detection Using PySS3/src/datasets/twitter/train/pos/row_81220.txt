Well I thought friends don't lie to each other but ig that's out of the window When u promise a friend you'll never do something, dont do the thing 

One "friend" of mine once lied and told people I did something I didnt so I asked my other friend to block them and never talk to them again(they promised they'll do that)and yet they did talk, it's not anything bad but still, I'm just disappointed rn 

Ughhh I'm so upset by this tho 

I kinda feel betrayed idk just like maybe I'm overthinking this or something but I don't like this.

And the ex "friend" ask my friend to send me a message  "the void" idk what that means anyone have any ideas?
