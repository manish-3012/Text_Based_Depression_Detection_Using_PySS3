I just got my FIRST job interview Iâ€™ve had the worst luck with getting a job. Iâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™ve never even been able to land an interview despite applying to jobs weekly and having volunteer experience. But today I got an email from Cheesecake Factory asking me to call them to schedule an interview:))
