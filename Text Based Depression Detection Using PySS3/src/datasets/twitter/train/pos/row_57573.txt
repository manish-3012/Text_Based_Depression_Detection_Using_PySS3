It's ok to eat your poop just don't tell anyone Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kxxdvm/do\_not\_eat\_your\_poop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/kxxdvm/do_not_eat_your_poop/)

So a few days ago I posted something which basically said that you should not eat your poop, I was wrong. I did not feel good after doing it but that doesn't mean that you can't do it ever. After I ate my poop I went to bed and woke up feeling worse then I did before. I decided to go to r/Advice and ask for help BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY DECIDED TO BAN ME!!!! Since I didn't get a good enough answer on r/Advice I decided to go to r/pollgames and ask them if I should go to the hospital. The people on r/pollgames told me to go to the hospital so the next day I went to the hospital. When I went to the hospital and told them what happened, THEY THOUGHT I WAS JOKING!!!! WHY WOULD I BE JOKING ABOUT EATING MY POOP?! Eventually they realized I wasn't joking so they brought me into a room and asked me a bunch of questions. APPARENTLY IT IS TOTALLY FINE TO EAT YOUR OWN POOP YOU WILL JUST GET A LITTLE SICK!!!!!! THESE PEOPLE ON REDDIT KEEP ON TELLING ME THAT I'M GOING TO DIE BUT THOSE DOCTORS SAID THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO KILL ME!!!!! SO BECAUSE OF REDDIT I WAS STUCK IN THIS GODAMN HOSPITAL FOR AN ENTIRE DAY AND I HAVE TO TAKE MEDICATION EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!!
