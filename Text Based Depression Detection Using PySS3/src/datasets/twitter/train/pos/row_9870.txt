How can I convince my friend to leave her extremely toxic boyfriend? So a friend of mine recently told me that one of her friends is being manipulated by her extremely toxic and asshole boyfriend, and we are trying to convince her to leave him, but she is just too stubborn and clinged to the point where she is even defending him! I already lost hopes for her... Do y'all know if there is still a way to help her???
