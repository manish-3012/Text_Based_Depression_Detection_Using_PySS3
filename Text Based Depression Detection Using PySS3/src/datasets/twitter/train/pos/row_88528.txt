im gonna tell all u guys how i skip school whenever i like without any repercussions. iâ€™m in the extension class and get perfect grades so before you say anything ab omG gO to ScHool. pls go away. i literally mentally cannot do this sh1t sometimes.

anyway.

step 1

the only way my Grandparents will know iâ€™m skipping is a single text that the school sends to my Nan when iâ€™m marked absent at the start of the day. 

i tested this out with a friend, when you block a number it â€˜goes throughâ€™ on their end (the schools in this case) but you donâ€™t get the message.

so i blocked the school number on Nannyâ€™s mobile.

step 2 

prepareeee

i set some pillows, food and water in the spare room by my room. Nobody goes in here, ever. because itâ€™s my space. 


step 3

wake up at 6am, itâ€™s time to go to school.

get dressed say goodbye and walk out the door like i normally would for the bus. 

cycle back round to the spare room and go through the window i left open. 

spend the rest of the day with my computer, food and water vibing in the spare room.

4pm comes round, i go back out and come back in the front door like i just finished school.

2 ez.
