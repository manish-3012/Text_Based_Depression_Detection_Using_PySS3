Help, I need a job! I live in a really small town in the midwest, and I'm in need of a job. My parents don't want to help pay for my needs and they seem out of touch with how to get a job, telling me to walk to local businesses and ask if their hiring. It's kind of hard to do that in a town with a population of 3,000, cause well...there are hardly any local businesses. I don't have a car and I need to rely on others for rides. Any advice for a 17 year old looking for their first job in 2020?
