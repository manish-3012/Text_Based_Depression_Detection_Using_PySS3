Just failed my first ICBC knowledge test, I'm in misery :'( With the booking system how it is as well I'm unlikely to get another appointment until April. I'm so embarrassed because all my friends have been telling me all week how easy it is and there's no way I could fail. Even my dad gave me that 'wtf is wrong with you' look. I would like to disappear now. Anyways if you need me I'll be crying in my room while I write a history paper :'(
