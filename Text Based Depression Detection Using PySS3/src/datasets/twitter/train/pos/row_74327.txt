My girlfriend got me something, and I didn't, is this wrong? So I think around a month ago I made a post concerning my crush and the comments told me to confess and I did and now we're together :D. Anywho, she got me a Valentine's gift meanwhile I, did not. She told me  that I shouldn't get her one and I asked her "Are you sure?" 3 times. 

idk if I'm wrong or not I just feel really guilty
