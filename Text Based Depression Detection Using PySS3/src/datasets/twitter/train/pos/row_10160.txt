I really miss this person I was in the talking stage with :/ Iâ€™ve been thinking about it way too often recently I met him from a dating app (yeah... Ik) and at first I was iffy about facetiming him for some reason but then as I called him I started liking him more and more 

And we would constantly send each other texts and FaceTime each other into the night :,) 

He was soooo sweet and he had such a good sense of humor he was such great company itâ€™s insane 

Things kinda fell through when he wouldnâ€™t respond as often, he said it was mainly bc he was having a hard time and needed to take a break from his phone 

Then when he did start talking again I was pretty pessimistic about this whole Covid thing, wasnâ€™t very positive about it bc I knew it wasnâ€™t gonna go away, but he would constantly tell me to be positive then we havenâ€™t talked :(
