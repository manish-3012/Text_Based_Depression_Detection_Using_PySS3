My daughters want opinions from anyone aged preschool to age 17 My daughters and I have been writing a comedy series together using stuffed animals, animation, and some live-action. We have been making videos and scripts together since quarantine and we've never been closer. They wanted to share the first episode with you guys to get your opinion. They especially would like to know what your siblings think. If you have 3 minutes, please watch and comment here or on the video itself. Thank you!  https://youtu.be/9dvoUF_kN6E
