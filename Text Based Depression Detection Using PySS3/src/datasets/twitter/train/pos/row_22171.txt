why lootboxes are rigged (at least for cs:go) people say it a lot, but here's the math

blue gun: 80%

purple gun: 15%

pink gun: 3%

red gun: 1.9%

knife skin: 0.27%

stat trak knife: 0.027%

stat trak flip knife: 0.00135%

stat trak bright water flip knife: 0.00002755102%

stat trak battle scarred right water flip knife: 0.00000459183%, which is roughly 20 million cases you would have to open, with an average of 10 seconds to open it would take 6.3 years, and it would cost you about 50,000,000 dollars. For a 1,700 dollar knife.
