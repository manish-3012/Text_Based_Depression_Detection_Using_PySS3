All this over SHIT???? So I dropped a big one and clogged the toilet because it couldnâ€™t flush. So my dad unclogged the toilet and tells me to shower. Whenever I forget to wipe/flush (I know thatâ€™s gross), he occasionally pulls the â€œyour mom used to do that!â€ card which is really insulting because my mom/his first wife IS DECEASED! So it makes me feel like heâ€™s being a jackass. Iâ€™m kind of pissed
