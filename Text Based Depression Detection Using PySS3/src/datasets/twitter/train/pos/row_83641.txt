I JUST HAD THE GREATES IDEA FOR A YOUTUBE SERIES! Ok, so imagine a person with a mental illness going to a psychiatrist to talk and seek help. The office is dark, and you cant see the doctor's face, only his body. The main character lays on the couch and recalls their day, and any problems they have. While they recall, it's like an animation, but everytime they cant remember, the style changes to show their mental degradation from years of neglect. The patient can recall their day, but the details deviate from what they say, and they show what really happened. The Doctor sits in their chair and talks to the person, but  o face. All you see of them is their hands as they write, their legs cross, and their outfit. It's the same patient every day, but with a new problem, and a new version of their story, which they have no way of knowing which is true anymore. Each "season" has the doctor uncover parts of their patient's past, and uncover the source of their illness, and ultimately help them recover without medication, but instead with therapy and honesty.


I would love to hear any opinions on this story, and if you want to pitch an idea, I would love to hear them.
