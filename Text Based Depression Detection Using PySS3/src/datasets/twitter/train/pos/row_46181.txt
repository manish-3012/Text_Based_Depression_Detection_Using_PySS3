my prom experience .... not the best really.... prom was bad i hated it i hated everyone there i hated the place i hated parties. i now assure you that i am not a guy who does these kinda parties i just am a lame kid and that's okay.

&amp;#x200B;

day starts out with me being late as usual and then i go there at 7 to meet some people from school

&amp;#x200B;

we don't talk at all and i just talk to my friend who is the reason i payed to go there. we talk we take some pics with the suits and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

prom hasn't started yet btw we are just waiting in a hall.

&amp;#x200B;

after a while kids get inside the hall for the prom thingy but i am not allowed inside yet because i am an out comer (it was my school but i was an out comer for reasons too much to explain really) so i had to wait all alone for a while to just see boys with their girlfriends flirting and some kids vaping and smoking whatever in a nonsmoking area

&amp;#x200B;

5 minutes later they let me in and i go to my friend and we just sit there and talk

&amp;#x200B;

music is so loud i can't hear anyone or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

and then it starts. they play happy.... 

&amp;#x200B;

then everyone gets up and up with epic dance moves boys and girls shaking dat ass while i am siting all alone wondering why i came here

&amp;#x200B;

someone from school sees me (not a friend really just a guy... might even call him my highschool bully from pre covid) and invites me to dance with his friends group

&amp;#x200B;

i go and this is where awkwardness starts 

&amp;#x200B;

i am not used to dancing or whatever and the songs they had on were so trash

&amp;#x200B;

i was all alone with a friend trying to fit in so i was 100 just screaming and crying inside

&amp;#x200B;

i just stand there and every now and then i would pop an epic fortnite dance move

&amp;#x200B;

then they play baby shark....

&amp;#x200B;

i just couldn't talk... 

&amp;#x200B;

how????

&amp;#x200B;

anyway we get to eating and i just felt terrible because there was so much food and by the end i learned from one of the people working there that all left over food will be thrown in the trash which made me feel terrible and hate that place even more

&amp;#x200B;

everyone gets their title, except me who was going to get "smartest" but didn't because i was an out comer 

&amp;#x200B;

then back to standing awkwardly around people dancing....

&amp;#x200B;

when a song played that had something to do with money and having too much and spending money came up when it hit me.  


i hate this. i am in everything i hate. and everything i disgrace. i hate spending money on fancy stuff just for the looks. being around boys and girls with fancy suits and dresses really didn't help. even me myself was a part of this. i am wearing a suit costing about 100$ and i payed for a ticket that cost about 50$  just for looks and the pic at the end with all the other kids (whom i hate)  


speakers and lights flickering.. that all costs money for "fun"  


all the food we had and the rest was thrown away... it is all for looks and i hate it i hate that i was a part of this 

&amp;#x200B;

i hate being alive. i hate being a part of this corrupted world. i hate spending money. i hate breaking stuff. i don't like seeing these people just jump around. i am glad they are happy but i hate seeing that this is how people enjoy themselves  


i hate life i hate living i hate everything and everyone.  


i am a lame kid. i always thought that money is the only reason i am not parting 24/7 or just having fun in general.  


i am just not fun at parties as the saying says i am a lame kid who likes being alone i like sleeping and staring at screens  


i like being alone. i always say that i hate how lonely i am but lets be real. i like it  


after all. there is a reason why i don't shave my neck beard or TRY to look good and be charismatic or whatever. it's because i like it

&amp;#x200B;

i hate life. i hate living. i want to kill myself. i have considered starting a school shooting many times. i am waiting for my death instead. bye
