Embarrassing story time about two years ago I tried giving my bf at the time head. Yeah so I had never done anything like this in my life and I didnâ€™t want to. Well we eventually got alone and he decides to try forcing the next move. Me, being a little bean, just started shaking uncontrollably. I started having an anxiety and eventually I passed out. My ex had to carry me out of the bathroom and I was out for a good 10 minutes. Not funny at the time but now whenever I make jokes around my friends about giving head they start shaking and then act like they passed out. Lowkey is pretty funny now. 

Also how shit is it that every time I spawn in minecraft itâ€™s always in a freaking Forrest. Hope you have a good day btw.
