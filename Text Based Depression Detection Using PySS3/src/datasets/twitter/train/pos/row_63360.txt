I did a pretty big oopsie in google chat Hello! So in school there is this girl that I like and you know I have feelings for her but Iâ€™m not sure if she has feelings for me which is fine because Itâ€™s not the main issue that Iâ€™m concerned about.

Anyway so in school we use google chat to communicate or you know update the students about school stuff, and since Iâ€™m the â€œclass clownâ€ (the kid who likes attention in class) I decided to write a sarcastic message about how I really dislike my classmates and that I deserve more respect. I know you have to have pretty big guts to pull off something like this, especially when the teacher can directly see what youâ€™ve written. 

You might wonder, why would you actually do this kind of thing thatâ€™s going to get you in trouble? And you know thatâ€™s right and all but thatâ€™s not really the main issue Iâ€™m worrying about. The issue that Iâ€™m really afraid of is after I published that message I began to overthink, like that my classmates are going to change their view about me, Iâ€™m usually the funny guy that everyone laughs with and for them to see that Iâ€™m writing a message like this is going to change their perspective of me in a negative way.

What should I do? Should I just move on because school starts in 16 days? And what about the girl that I really like. Do you guys think she will dislike me even more because of the message? Thank you for reading and I hope you can help me solve this problem. This is by far the stupidest mistake Iâ€™ve ever done in my entire life. I regret everything.
