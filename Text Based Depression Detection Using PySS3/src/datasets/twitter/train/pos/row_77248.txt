I'm done with life I am done with life. I have considered suicide many times before and even tried it once. It failed and I got scared so didn't do it again. But now I'm done. My teachers never encourage me. They always make fun of me and berate in front of the class. I even get bullied for this. My parents don't believe and just say man up. Tomorrow I'm gonna confess my feelings to the only person who understands me and end my misery. Thank you to all the redditors who shared their memes and posts which definetly extended my life a bit. If by any chances you are reading this Aleksandra, I have liked you for the past year and always will. Thank you for being the only one i could talk to.
