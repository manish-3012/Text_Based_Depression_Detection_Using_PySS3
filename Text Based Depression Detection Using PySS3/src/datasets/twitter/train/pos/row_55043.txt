Who's like me? I just thing I don't belong in this years, I hate almost everything new( except technology and cars), the music, and some brands, I love the music from the 70s and 80s, and also all of the culture of that years, i just wish I was alive in those years, because rn all the fashion and music are really shitty. Back then music wasn't so boring and repetitive, it was fun, it was happy, not the shit we got today.
