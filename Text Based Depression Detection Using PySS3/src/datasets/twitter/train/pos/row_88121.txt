I wanna move out I am done with my step - father. He isn't a bad person, I know he loves me and cares a lot about me but I don't like him. I feel uncomfortable around him. I tense when he touches me, I hate hugging him, I hate his political views and religious nature. I hate how he tries to give me his shitty advice that I never asked for. I don't want to live under the same roof as him. It's not his fault, he has never treated me badly or anything but I failed to create an emotional bond with him and now I feel like I'm living with a stranger. 
 I can't wait to move out, I don't want to see him anymore.
