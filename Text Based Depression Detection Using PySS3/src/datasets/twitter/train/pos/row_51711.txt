Oh god I was so cringe last year. I looked at some of the posts I made last year when I was new and holy fuck that was cringe. I made posts like "Hmu I'm horny" or "I'm bore. Hmu" and "Why does no one wants to be friends with me?" Fucking hell. And here I was thinking I had never made those kinda posts.
