kebab shop I went to manor take away to buy a simple kebab with sauce seeming I hadn't eaten in 3 days. He wasn't paying attention and ended up messing my order up. I leave the shop to find heaps of lettuce, cabbage and whatever else on it. Being the introvert I am I said nothing and had a little vent at home while Calling the fella who made the kebab some not so nice names . My sister ended up eating it .
