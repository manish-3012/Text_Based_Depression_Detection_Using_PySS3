Thank you to a teen (I am not a teen) Hello teens.  

I just got home from parent teacher conference.  
The conference where via phone and I had to call numbers that parent signed up with. 
A young man, 8th grader,  signed himself up because his mom was working.  

I was surprised he answered the phone but I told him about his grades and how well he does in class.  He had some questions about the schools return plan in person and I answered them.  I thanked him for take an interest in his education and advocating for himself.  He made my day.  

Thank you!
