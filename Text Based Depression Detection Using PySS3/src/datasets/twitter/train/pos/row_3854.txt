I FINISHED MY DRAMA PERFORMANCE! First post, on mobile if that makes a difference

So due to global situations my schoolâ€™s Awards Night (where students display artwork and their achievements) was filmed in sections and will be posted online for families to view. The media squad went to different classes to film for the past few weeks.

I was in the senior school drama class and we were given an assignment to be presented during the Awards filming. We had to do a interpretation of the play Hoods. We decided to focus on inter-generational violence and trauma (how it can cycle and repeat).

All through out the week we had been rehearsing whenever we could but on Wednesday we were basically about to give up. We didnâ€™t and we preformed it today after A LOT of stressing. 

Everyone was basically at the end of our ropes (there was 5 of us) and we snapped a few times at each other but we all worked suuuuuuper hard to make it into something we were proud of. We were the last to get filmed, so we had tonnes of practice time and the performance went amazing by my teacherâ€™s opinion.

We only had to do one take of filming (we all thought there would be multiple), we found out later it was because the Media leader thought the first take was good and he was tired from other filming.

It overall we are still riding this adrenaline high and freaking out because we were all so focused on our parts (some of us felt genuine emotions during our scenes like anger &amp; fear) it became a blur. I know we are going to pick apart the performance when we see it on video but our teacher says this was our best performance. Our teacher might be a bit biased but she said â€œit was the best adaptation on Hoods she had seen.â€

I have been smiling since, sorry for slightly bragging but thank you for reading :)

TL:DR - had to preform an adaptation of a play for a filmed school event. We basically were about to give up but weâ€™re encouraged to continue and it went amazing
