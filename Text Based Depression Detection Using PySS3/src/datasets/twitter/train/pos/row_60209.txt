I had my first kiss today... and second... and yea you get the idea My girlfriend and I got together in December, and due to COVID risks in our area, were only able to see each other recently. We were supposed to stay mostly distanced but... um... each of our parents knew that wouldn't be possible, let's say, so they both gave us gum on our way there, and her mom even winked while doing it. It was not what I was expecting (if you've kissed a pet or your mother's cheek before it's nothing like that- much softer) but amazing in every way nonetheless. Holding her in my arms was the most heavenly experience I've ever had in my life, and something I will never forget. For those reading this sad today because it's Valentine's day, alone, just know that I was in your position for such a long time. The struggle will end, and you will all find someone you love. It gets better, I promise.
