my favorite pastime is working out at night thinking itâ€™ll give me a lasting brain boost for hw but instead feeling drained an hour after then scrolling social media while i wait for my fatigue to fade but end up only doing assignments due at midnight and taking a 3 hour nap to finish the rest due in the morning, only to repeat the cycle
