Iâ€™ve officially become the victim of classic Reddit reposting!!! YAY!!!! So if you go to my profile, youâ€™ll see that I made a post yesterday in r/therewasanattempt involving the placement of BLM. Now if you go to r/AccidentalRacism my photo is all over the front page but posted by different people. I think I should be upset but honestly I think itâ€™s too funny that it sparked this much attention.
