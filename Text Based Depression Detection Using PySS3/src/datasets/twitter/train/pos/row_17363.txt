Donâ€™t you hate it when your family talks about you ? This always happens to me when I go to parties,restaurants or even at my own house when guests come in .My grandma always talks about me and my brothers about how we do this and that basically bad stuff about us and I hate it. Does this happens to you guys too ? Or how did you made them stop talking about you in front of people ?
