GET TOXIC PEOPLE OUT OF YOUR LIFE, HON This is a deadly serious piece of advice that needs to be said: if there is anyone toxic in your life that you can kick out, DO IT. Depending on who it is, it may be hard. I've had to get rid of an ex/friend and a best friend because they were making me feel horrible, and believe me, it took forever, because there were still emotions and connections there. But God, am I happy that I don't have to deal with them anymore. I'm not as sensitive, I cry significantly a lot less now and it's given me more freedom to make new friends and connect more with people I actually care about.

So take my advice. Kick those idiots out of your life to let good people in. If you need any more advice, I have, sadly, a lot of experience in this area, and I would be honoured to help anyone who wants to make their life better.

Be happy, stay safe :)
