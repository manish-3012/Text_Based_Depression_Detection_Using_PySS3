I did the impossible I did the impossible

I won an argument against my mom.

My mom was telling me to get a new interest. I already have writing and stop motion animation as my hobbies. They take up quite a lot of my time. I donâ€™t really have a need for more interests or the time for one. That was when my mom walked away and shouted, â€œwhy canâ€™t you be irrational for once!â€ She jokes around. She wasnâ€™t really mad. Although she was actually upset a bit.
