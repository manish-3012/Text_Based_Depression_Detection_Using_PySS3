Whatâ€™s a weird tradition you randomly started but always love doing For me itâ€™s on the last day of school I watch goofy movie. This movie has no reason to be this good. Iâ€™m gonna say it, best Disney movie ever. Great music,story,has character progression,great animation,it has heart. This movie is criminally underrated  itâ€™s sooooo good.
