am I being entitled or what?? I don't got much family, half my family lives in Pakistan all the way across the world, and then my other family lives where I live but I'm only close with my first cousins, with my family here it's all from my dad's side, so like the people I'm close with is my cousins and their parents are my dad's brother y'know so like my dad has 2 other brothers and their families are normal and good, and my family is well dysfunctional, my dad is essentially shunned by them bc my dad's an ass, and because of that I'm not really involved with the family, it's not that they hate me but I just idk it's hard to explain it but my uncle's kids/ my cousins are so close with each other and they see each other every week while I see them maybe like 5-7 times a year, my aunt's don't tell me when they do stuff together and shit, I feel so left out, I feel like a black sheep because my parents are divorced and shit and that my dad is literally psychotic. all I'm tryna say ig is that I just wanna be more involved with my family, I wanna be with em, that's all I want
