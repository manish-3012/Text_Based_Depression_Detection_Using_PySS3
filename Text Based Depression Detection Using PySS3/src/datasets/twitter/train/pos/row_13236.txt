The State Of Discussions On r/teenagers ***Having a different opinion or perspective is a crime.***

At least this is what I've learned from this subreddit. Every single time someone brings up a controversial topic, it gets downvoted and flooded with primitive comments telling them to shut up. That's just sad. If you don't want to bother writing a huge paragraph about why the OP is in the wrong, you can just downvote the post.

I have a lot of standpoints that others might despise me for, and I'm not afraid to express them, but let it be known that I have tried my hardest not to hate on someone with a comment that has less potential than just saying "Your mom fat".  Instead, I try to form a well-made text that takes elements from the previous arguments, voice my opinion on them and then continue to explain why. Finally, I close with a conclusion. This costs me large amounts of time, but I am willing to pay that price for a well-rounded, civilized conversation. 

To those who wish to spark the flame to a heated discussion, to converse with people and exchange opinions and knowledge, choose your words wisely, and you will succeed more often. To those that disagree with my perspective, now's your time to explain why you do so.
