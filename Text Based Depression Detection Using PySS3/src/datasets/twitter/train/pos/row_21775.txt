using 'ðŸ¥°' after your comment or post something irrational does not automatically make you right. Like bro, putting some random ass emoji after you make a dumbass statement that will make anyone with an I.Q above room temperature most likely disagree with you does not make you sound smart, instead trying using facts and logic to support your argument instead of thinking that any opinion you hold is objectively correct and anyone else who disagrees with you is wrong.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
