Day 3 of therapy (3/4) **Still a long post**


This day was... quite eventful. And tiring. And a bit annoying! 
So, morning started with a drawing kind of excersize. We had to draw ourself, and make a crest/arms for ourselves. But, I couldn't finish it, because I was taken away (':
Did some story creating, then picure completion excersize with the dude from yesterday, turned out fine I guess lol.
Went back to do this crest/arms thing after, could manage like 10-15 mins, THEN, our supervisor told us a *therapy horse* is coming to the hospital, and we can go hand out with it! We went one by one to meet &amp; greet the pony, each of us spending about 20 mins with him, and his caretaker, who would ask questions (aka tried being a psychologist as well), but just had a very annoying energy to her. I didn't like the woman, but I liked the pony, he was very cute.
After pon-pon time, I thought I would be good for the day, and that I could finally finish the stuff I started, but literally just as I was about to sit down, they called me, to go, and talk w another someone &gt;:")
There were 3 of us this time, the annoying always Staring Woman, and a psych student I belive (?) who needed me for an interview basically. We did that, Staring Woman was of course... being herself, and staring the whole time.. except when she was scribbling on her notes.

And by the time THIS was done, everyone else completed their work with the arting thing :"")
We got lunch, and did our almost final task, which was putting together various items which symbolized us, friends, family, activities, items etc, and arrange it in a way so it shows how close to/far away from us these things were. We explained it, blah blah blah, and got to the *final* task of the day, which was the same as on day 1. Pick a dixit card that represents your mood of this day. I picked one where  many annoying little thing were surrounding a character, because... because how this day was. 



Tomorrow is the final day.
