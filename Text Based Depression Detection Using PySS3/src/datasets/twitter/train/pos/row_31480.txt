What do i do So like I really like this girl and we used to study at the same place and were in the same class previous year. Almost an year ago a friend of mine told me that she liked me too. I thought about asking her out but then I was afraid that maybe my friend was trolling me and she didn't actually liked me and I'd end up making a fool of myself
