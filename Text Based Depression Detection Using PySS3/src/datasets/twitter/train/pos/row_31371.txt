My country's tv is weird We stopped airing Eurovision (a song contest between European countries) because there were 'people who are not approved to be on tv' (homosexuals)

But we keep airing Loud House, DC Super Hero Girls, and Owl House who all have gay/lesbian characters in them.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We banned a violent tv show on an adult channel because 'kids were affected in a violent way'

But we aired all the Star Wars: Clone Wars episodes on CN without a problem

All snacks commercials were banned on children's to reduce junk food between children (which makes sense)

But there are literally cartoons made in here that tell little children how great junk food is.

Wtf?
