Iâ€™m a murderer I was working in the Garden today and I saw a butterfly bouncing around on the concrete. 

I walked over to it and noticed that itâ€™s wing had been broken off, it would never fly again. 

I started working again and out of the corner of my eye I saw it once more, attempting to fly. 

I could feel his pain and I know I had to do something. I held the butterfly for a moment, it was almost like I was starting into his soul, or He was staring into mine. 

I put him down gently and picked up a brick from the concrete. I dropped it onto the poor thing, killing it instantly. 

I canâ€™t help but wonder if it would of wanted me to do it.
