Am I a psychopath My life has been super fuckin busy the past few weeks and itâ€™s probably gonna stay this way until December but I love this shit. Iâ€™ve been going back to the gym every single day, Iâ€™ve been working as much as I can, my major is killing me so I spend a ton of time studying and working on that shit, and I have almost zero free time but I actually like it. At the end of the day I get into bed and Iâ€™m absolutely wiped out but I enjoy the feeling. I donâ€™t understand.
