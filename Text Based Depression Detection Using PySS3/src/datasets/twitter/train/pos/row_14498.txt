I think i would need some advices. (I hope this is the right place to post this) So im a 17 yo guy and i never had a girlfriend or anything remotely close. Everytime i tried getting close to a girl i became their best friend somehow. At first i was too scared to tell any of them that i had feelings towards them but then i decided that im going to do everything differently with the next one and even confess to her if its not obvious.

Long story short i found a new girl and tried doing everything differently and even confessed to her but she tood me that im not her type (im one of her best friends now too) and i just don't get it.

They all keep saying that i would be a perfect boyfriend but i think they just say that to make me feel better.

Am only good for a friend? Am i just not enough?
Advices are welcome
