Day 4 of my weight loss Day four is here. Yes I know I already posted today but it was a late post and it was technically day 3 since I wrote the post last night. Anyway hereâ€™s the stuff.

Breakfast: One Fried Egg with Toast and Grape Jelly

Lunch: Chicken Caeser Salad with Caeser Dressing and Ranch

Supper: (this is where I messed up today) Fried Chicken Sandwich with Fries. (I feel horrible after it Iâ€™m sick to my stomach I definitely shouldnt have eaten it and I regret it)

Physical Activity: Still canâ€™t leave the yard because of a threat so hereâ€™s what I did workout wise in the house.

10 lunges

20 squats

1 minute plank

10 sit-ups

10 lunges 

I did that two times and was gonna go for a run but my parents said no.

Starting weight: 158lbs

Todayâ€™s weight: 154.8 lbs

Goal weight: 125 lbs

Notes: I regret today. I didnâ€™t do much and was fairly inactive and ate junk food at the end of the day. Gonna try to workout more tomorrow.
