Advice to boys about girls from a boy Girls giving advice about girls is like a fish teaching how to clean one, it doesnt really know, you gotta ask the fisherman how to clean one.

If you want a girl:
- Girls go crazy about riddles. If you give for example a riddle to your crush saying if she solves it she will know who your crush is, she goes crazy. All the mystery makes her mind go crazy she really wants to find out who it is because you act so secret. Everyone loves secrets. Maybe surprise her when she finds out and wants to be your gf?!?
- show attention to her. Be there for her, be active with her.
- be sudden. Surprise her, be unexpected towards girls.
- be slow, dont rush things, patience is the key.

How to treat girl:
- Girls are emotionally weaker than men, thats why men should treat them with respect.
- be nice to her like she's your friend. If in relationship do something more and special, be her sunshine.

Idk anything more, remember no sex before marriage or anything like that.
