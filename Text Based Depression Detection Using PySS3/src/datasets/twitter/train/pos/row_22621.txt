That moment when you and your crush are passing notes Ahhh I almost died that was so cool. 

Then at the end of the day, everyoneâ€™s doing just dance except me. This teacher comes up to me and says â€œyou donâ€™t liek dancing?â€ 

And I said â€œ(awkward laughter) noâ€ then she said â€œoh okay. By the way, what were those notes you were passing to (crushâ€™s name)?â€

I kinda panicked and said â€œuhh nothing interestingâ€
