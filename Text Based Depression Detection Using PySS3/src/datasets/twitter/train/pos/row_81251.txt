advise i guess so there is a girl i know from childhood. we stopped meeting each other for awhile and now we are getting back in touch. i thought i was probably friendzoned by now . we were exchanging no. but i did not save it immediately   after a while i sent her a message saying that i had saved her no. and she replied with 

"So u need to make that person a friend (and a potential ...idk what word to use but if u get it) to save the number,  huh?"

what could this  mean .

side note i was once joking about only saving the no. of friends and imp people
