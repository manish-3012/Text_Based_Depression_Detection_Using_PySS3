Discord support reply Hey!, i know this doesnt really belong on here but i posted the same question on the discordapp subreddit and i didnt get an answer. So recently my discord got suspended, so i sent a plea email around 4 days ago and i still havent recived word back. When should i expect them to get back to me?, cause ive got online classes starting on thursday where we'll be using discord for math, social studies, geography, polish, chemistry and biology and i can probably skip like 3-4 days but after that i'd start falling behind on my studies
