Iâ€™m tired of being called misogynist cause I donâ€™t like to wear pink.. First of all, sex has no color and what not I understand that. Iâ€™ve been called sexist because I do not like wearing pink clothes! I just say I look ridiculous because itâ€™s not my style! Just like I wouldnâ€™t wear lime. Itâ€™s like asking a goth to wear a bright ass color, thatâ€™s ridiculous.
