Yo so the next time someone is arguing with you, take a step back and just look at their face It always makes me laugh , how their nostrils are flaring and how their face has turned with anger lmao. I genuinely burst out laughing, it does make them more mad but hey it's a win for me!

PS: If you gonna try this with your teacher or parents don't blame me, just saying
