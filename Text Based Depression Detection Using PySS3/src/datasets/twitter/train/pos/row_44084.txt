Someone should no cap make a Reddit 2 Like just an app where you can post to a certain board and you have the option to look at stuff in new or trending . Like combine tik tok and Reddit together it would be kinda dope . Like most of the Reddit community is super bad so having a brand new modern and reworked version of Reddit with a different better community would be dope .
