What I like about Socialism as an older teen. One thing that I like about Socialism is that in a socialist society, people who can contribute to society but don't, will not receive anything.

Meaning Deadbeat, Lazy, and parasitical people will never be able to live a good life compared to someone who works hard to give value to the community.

How about you guys? What do you like/hate about socialism and/or capitalism?
