The House of the Haunted Moon (I wrote this fictional short story and wanted to share, itâ€™s not very long)

01_x000D_
Once there was a town and, in this town, lived close to a thousand men. It was a thriving community with the gold rush of 1892. On a hill on the outskirts of the town, was a large wooden manor. And in this manor the people would gather to compare the worth of their gold._x000D_
Well on a fateful day in 1900, with a full moon on the horizon, struck a rumble and a bang. The town was lost for good. Except for the house on the hill which stood strong against the quake. The ghosts of the town still roam there today. It since has rotted and wore but the ghosts there still roam. And it is said that at 10pm on a full moon night, one can visit the place. And they'll be greeted by a horrible sight of the folk still roaming as the dead. And then, all will go quiet again._x000D_
That is the tale of the House of the Haunted Moon._x000D_

Meet Johnny, a 13-year-old boy in 2032.

The tale of the House of the Haunted Moon is one I've heard for years. It's been passed down through generations. My great-great-great grandfather used to be one of the settlers in that town. Of course, in the earthquakes he died. From what Iâ€™ve heard, he always thought something was suspicious of that house. He just never knew what._x000D_
One day, I was curious about this house, I wanted to the truth. The locals scoffed at the idea, saying it was an old myth made to scare the children. It couldn't possibly have stood there for 200 years, could it?_x000D_
When I stepped out from my robo-taxi, I found a strange sight. The house was fine! I looked up to see a huge wooden manor with a stone foundation looking back at me. No one was around, except an old man in a thin jacket with an eyepatch. He stood on the street corner, eyeing me. _x000D_

I reached my hand out to open the door before I was interrupted. _x000D_
"BOY!" he yelled at me._x000D_
I looked over to see he was approaching me. Before I could figure out what to do, I could feel his breath on me, "Boy," he said again. "Boy listen to me. I've been here longer than you've been alive. Standing on that street corner there in this here jacket. I've seen the downfall of this country. I've seen it all. And trust me, I've never, NEVER seen a man come back out of there." He paused._x000D_
"And if you open that door, you'll have the same fate as the other boys like you that went in. Or, you go home and never come back."_x000D_
I considered my options. I wanted to know what was in there so much. I was a bit skeptical of the man, yet intimidated by his lecture. _x000D_
"I'll take my chances," I told him._x000D_
He sighed. "I can't stop you,â€ he whispered._x000D_
My hand reached out to the door handle, made of polished silver. It felt cold in the Arizona heat. I grabbed it firmly, before pulling the heavy door open. There was a flash and a bang and suddenly I wasn't there._x000D_

Meet the old-man, 2035_x000D_

I saw a young woman step out of a robo-taxi. She looked about 15, in her teenage years. After all my years here on the corner by the house of the haunted moon, I'd seen a lot. No one ever took my warning, and I didn't feel she would either. Sure enough, she walked up to the door and was taken by the mysterious forces inside. Just like the last dozen. _x000D_
And it is said, that on a full moon night one can visit the place and be greeted by an awful sight. A cursed mansion with an appetite for your demise. That is the truth to the House of the Haunted Moon. But no one listens._x000D_
