Guess the song from the lyrics (formatting on mobile sucks Iâ€™m sorry) My bitch, she's lifeless with a [?] in light skin, yeah
Pale skin, she's my Vampress mistress, only wakes up in the eclipse
Okay
Black eyes, so soulless, 6-1-6 is when the devil calls okay
Reap what you sow, cuts in the snow, pray that it won't kill us all
Cuts on her skin, gather all the men, women, children that are felling empty, okay
Some are crying and screaming never wanted help because you hate the fucking sympathy yeah
It's because of people that are like this didn't really like the way they made you feel less, no
Lifeless succubus, let the blood drip from your nose onto a canvas, okay
Slit your eyes, peep the bullshit, endure all of it until you can't no more, no more
Feeling so depressed, watch the tears shed from your face and there's blood all on the floor, the floor
Feeling natural [?] you're soulless, you couldn't take no more, no more
Black candles start to light 'em up, watch it all burn down till there is no more, no more
Feeding off of the life forms they're hurting, self-degrading more, oh no
You don't wanna know where I have been, it's a dark place where the sun doesn't shine anymore, yeah, yeah
