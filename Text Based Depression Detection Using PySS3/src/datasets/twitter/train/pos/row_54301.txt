Yah I wanna rant lol, also help me So thereâ€™s this girl I like. When we were in our first years(classmates), we had this mutual understanding. Not long after that we â€œgo separate waysâ€ (I think she used her mom as an excuse). At that time I was one of those kids who thinks being popular was everything, never thought I would turn into this edgy guy who watches anime(not weeb eww) and likes playing games. Yah sure, I go out to play basketball at some private gym with my batch mates every Thursday ( its our Saturday), but itâ€™s still difficult to make friends and make eye contact and stuff. I stayed mad at her from like our 1st and 2nd years. As soon as I lost my douche friends who made me popular, I guess I realized I still like her???? I dunno Iâ€™m too young and dumb. I tried talking to her around 3rd year high school but she keeps avoiding me, itâ€™s hard to get the chance to talk to her personally. And now... everything is online. I canâ€™t get the chance to interact with her, she wonâ€™t even reply to my messages. â€œItâ€™s my choiceâ€ she texted to my friend(the friend resembles Peter Griffin btw but he good). What should I do? We have no physical interaction lol. I only remembered her when I was in the mood to get an Aoba Johsai jacket (look it up). Any idea? Tips? Since yâ€™all teens here with actual experience in these stuff.
