To De: I'm sorry for the way things ended. I hope you know that I'm not the same person I was two years ago. Back then I was broken. I didn't know who I was or who I needed to be. I just knew that I was hurt. You tried to help me but you couldn't. You told me every time you helped I'd make a little bit of progress and then run in the other direction. I needed someone to help me and it felt like you just left me so I blamed you. I can't tell you all this face to face now, because you're just... gone. No instagram, no facebook, I can't even find your s/o. I hope you're okay. And if somehow by the grace of whoever is up there you see this please reach out to me. I want to show you that I'm a better friend, a better person than I was then. 





Sorry for the rant everyone, I just needed to get this out
