Cannot create an Instagram account for my music pageðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ Background: A number of years back, I impersonated my friend on Instagram as a joke (obviously) I was 15. My friend reported me a bunch and as a result I could not login to the Instagram app on my phone.

Seeing as I could still login on safari I didnâ€™t bother contacting Instagram to get it fixed.

As of right now I can login on to the app from any of my family members phones, from our home Wi-Fi. I have gotten a new phone 3 times now and this does not help, it still says my account is disabled. 

I donâ€™t know if Instagram has flagged my phone number or my IP address or something else. (My personal iPad has the same issue)

Instagram will not let me create a new Instagram account from my iPhone it says that my account has been disabled for violating the terms and conditions.

When trying to login to Instagram on my iPhone on the app it gives me the message â€œError Sorry, there was a problem with your requestâ€

After years of being on Instagram on safari I am trying to start a music page and I cannot make one. I do not know who to contact or what to do, any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I cannot login to insta on the app on my iPhone and iPad, I donâ€™t know who to contact

PS FUCK THE ZUC
