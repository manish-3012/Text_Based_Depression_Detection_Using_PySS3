How do I handle being put down and harassed by others? To start off, I'm not a super confident guy. At one point I was always that guy who had been picked last for every game and group activity. Now, over the course of the quarantine, I've been through a lot mentally and have physically grown as well. I'm now focusing on self-improvement and have made decent progress as far as my mental, physical, spiritual, and social health, as well as trying to improve every other aspect of my life. I still have a long ways to go. However, some of my friends have been putting me down as they see me improving. Other guys my age are starting to act hostile towards me as I've made progress. And some of their "girlfriends" have started to notice me. I'm not a super confident or arrogant person, but as this 6-and-a-half foot tall, awkward, "wide-eyed" white guy, I feel I'm an easy target. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the harassment? Why is this happening to me?
