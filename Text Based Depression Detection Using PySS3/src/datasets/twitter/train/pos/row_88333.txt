I thought about it and I really only overthink about what I said earlier if I was talking to someone I genuinely liked I guess thatâ€™s a normal thing to do but yeah I think I come off as way more confident and comfortable with people I donâ€™t like. People I like probably donâ€™t have any idea I even like them just bc of how critical I am about the things I say. I canâ€™t just be â€œcasualâ€ with someone I respect u know. Itâ€™s super easy to talk to people I donâ€™t like and I can just say whatever I want bc I donâ€™t give a fuck about their opinion of me. That sounds sort of bad but when it comes to people I like, I REALLY donâ€™t wanna say the wrong thing so I might even be super quiet around them. Iâ€™m usually only someone who thinks a lot before I speak around people I like. Itâ€™s kind of strange. If I do end up messing up with my words around people I admire then I think about that for a long time afterwards. Like I think about all the different things I could have said and how what I said might have been taken the wrong way. I honestly think my goal is to impress people I like and this sometimes has the opposite effect. People donâ€™t really like people pleasers and I try to be â€œmyselfâ€ around cool people but itâ€™s so hard bc I just want them to like me.
