My teenage years feel cut short because of 2020 and I wish so much time hadn't been wasted *Just a quick warning, I'm just piling out my thoughts and they are depressing to say the least. There might be someone who relates to parts of this, maybe not.* 

Like everyone else, I had plans for this year. I was going to start living my life to the fullest, and things had been going really well in my personal life so it seemed like that was possible. I was almost out of my depressive episode, I had a solid group of friends for the first time in years, and was having successful encounters with my crushes.

Needless to say, the year did not turn out to be what I'd hoped. I became depressed again, fell into old bad habits and made new ones. For weeks - maybe even months - I stayed curled up on the floor in my room staring blankly at my phone or the carpet. Any significant object from pre-quarantine (like a playbill or a dress) became a relic to be worshipped. I didn't/couldn't leave the house for months, and even now I've only been outside around seven times. 

I can't even tell if I've snapped, but my own thoughts scare me now. All my fears worsened. When something good happens, I break down because I know it will be taken away by the misfortune that sits on my shoulders. Some days I don't feel anything, and other days my emotions are on thin ice. 

The worst thing about all this is that I'll never be able to get this time back. I can live a good adult life and live it up, but they won't be able to replace laughing with friends at the beach. Going to the back of the school by the dumpsters to listen to trashy music. Making stupid decisions. Having the largest of your problems being you hiding the F from family you got while you try to fix it. Things that aren't the same when you are an adult, or a child. So thanks 2020 for taking away the best out of "the best and worst years of my life".

Wow that's depressing, but hey I have an art prompt now so that's cool I guess.
