There was protesters outside my school today. I knew it would happen eventually. I live in a very American town, so people aren't afraid to "fight for their rights", even though their rights aren't being stripted away from them. 

The problem with this is that if they get what they want, and the at-school mask mandate is removed, the school can only go to distance learning again, which for anyone who has had that knows that you can barely learn doing it. (The same thing happened with my city's library: people protested against the mask mandate there, so they shut it down.)

I personally have no problem with the masks. I've never been "suffocated" by them; I've never thought that they infringe on my rights. It's better where I live because we don't have a public mask mandate, so we don't have to wear one 24/7 (except if the store or resteraunt has a mandate).

Sometimes people don't realize how good that they have it in comparison to other parts of the world.
