I just realized I just realized I joined Reddit on September 2nd, 2020. My 13th birthday was September 3rd, 2020. That means I was 12 when I joined Reddit.

Guys thatâ€™s illegal Iâ€™m going to jail. I canâ€™t believe this itâ€™s so crazy. To think had done something- so *wrong.* I donâ€™t want to go; it was a mistake, I didnâ€™t mean to. 

Iâ€™m disgusted with myself. Iâ€™m a criminal. I am apart of the law. I am a terrible creature which doesnâ€™t deserve recognition as a teenager. Iâ€™m a liar.

Before the CIA bust open my door, I want to say goodbye. The time I had in this sub was amazing. Thank you all. 

Goodbye, I must now spend my life in prison, like the tick on humanity I am. Farewell great redditors.
