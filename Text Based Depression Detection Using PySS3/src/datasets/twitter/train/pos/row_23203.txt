Youâ€™re great chris After he said â€œif you donâ€™t give me your paper to copy off of, youâ€™re gayâ€ (note: they â€œuse as an insultâ€ but they support) and I respond â€œhow do I give you half the paperâ€ (Iâ€™m bi) and he looked up at me confused and I said â€œIâ€™m half gayâ€ And he was said â€œwait... waaaaaait, noâ€ and I knew what he meant and I said â€œno, I donâ€™t like you that wayâ€ and then someone called me over to help them, when I get back I found out he told the a kid (I had already) I was half gay, and and then I said, â€œIâ€™m half straight toâ€ and looks surprised, fast foward a bit he asked â€œare there any guys you like at this school?â€ And I said â€œnoâ€ Chris responsed â€œare there any girls you likeâ€ and I said â€œyesâ€

After I told him who it was, he asked if I needed advice, cause he had dated her in the past, 

Overall thanks Chris, you good in my heart, and no, I wonâ€™t have a crush on you anytime soon
