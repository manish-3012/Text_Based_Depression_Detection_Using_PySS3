do guys really lose feelings this easily? iâ€™ll delete this post in a bit but 

so i was.. in love with this guy, he was in love with me. We spent so many hours cuddling, watching stars, and him telling me dreams he had about me.. in detail. Hundreds of hours of minecraft together, telling eachother everything... We planned a family and all that corny shit, he was literally perfect 

but one day, we broke up. I wish him nothing but the best, but i literally see him with a new girl every day, and he constantly tells me that he doesnâ€™t care about me anymore, and he doesnâ€™t need a proper love.. and his hoes are enough 

iâ€™m glad that heâ€™s moved on, but it just makes me sad that guys can switch up on you within literally a single day 

do you lot think he could seriously just care about sex more than the year of love we had..? or is he just trying to make me jealous and make it seem like he doesnâ€™t care about me 

i knew that boys can be... trash.. but do they really lose feelings this quick? 

his friend said he always talks about me idk
