Just reminding you to be nice to your teachers! And not just for them, for you too! Being nice to your teachers gets you so far. Theyâ€™ll be more willing to let you submit something late, and excuses will work much more often. Participating in class also has the same affect! If you answer a lot of questions they ask in class, not only will you more understand the homework, theyâ€™ll appreciate you for talking with them and will be much easier on you. Make everyday teacher appreciation day!
