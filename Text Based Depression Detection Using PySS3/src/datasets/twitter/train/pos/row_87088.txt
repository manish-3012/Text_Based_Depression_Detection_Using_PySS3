Anyone wanna be my coding buddy? I want someone to learn coding alongside and to work on projects with. I'm 17 year old girl and I am really good at html, css, know all the basics of JavaScript, and am slightly familiar with python and java. We could use discord and collaborate on projects somehow. Also just someone to chat with that's chill and non judgemental. If interested, comment or dm.
