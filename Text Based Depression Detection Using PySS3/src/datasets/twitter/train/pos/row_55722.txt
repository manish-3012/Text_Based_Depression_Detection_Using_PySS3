My friends are jerks. I am pretty social myself but I have not had a long-term friend for 5 years now. Some days ago I asked if I could go out with a friend and he ignored my message. One and a half hour later, I saw him with a common friend of ours hanging out and having a drink. Fortunately, he didn't see me. 
On a second occasion, I saw the same friend in the supermarket and asked him if I could join him with his friend that I saw him with some days ago. He said yes and told me that he would wait for me until I carried some groceries to home, which is 5 minutes away. When I got back, he didn't answer messages or phone, and they were nowhere close to the supermarket. 
Another 2 friends of mine are total jerks and gossip about everything and everyone in my small city. 
How the hell can I become antisocial? I don't want friends anymore.
