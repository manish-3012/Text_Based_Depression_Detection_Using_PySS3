If you ignore everyone who tries to talk to you and not try to socialize at all don't cry about not having friends I got one friend who always cries about how alone she is and no one ever talks to her yet whenever anyone tries to msg her/talk/arrange something she either ignores them completely or just say no

Then she complains to me that nobody wants to talk to her

Yeah what the fuck do you expect

I tried talking to her but it never goes anywhere
