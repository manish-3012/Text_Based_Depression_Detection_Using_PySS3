Some of us are not in control of our own lives anymore. 5 hours of online classes, 5 hours of homework. That's what our school has been giving out. All during exams. So when does a student have time for other things? It's been 4 months since I've had a gaming session. I can literally feel the weight of my eyelids since the past 2 or 3 weeks and I know I need a break. Aside from Saturdays and Sundays, there have been no holidays, even festivals are overlooked.  The teachers are constantly giving out homework too and as soon as you finish one, a new one is assigned. We can't really do anything about it because while we are trying to stay in this battle, no one else cares. My mental health has gone down and at this point, I'm a total wreck. So are we really in control of our lives anymore or is it grown ups controlling us with constant pressure?
