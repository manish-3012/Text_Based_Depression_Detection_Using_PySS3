Why Steam Support is garbage. **First off the only reason I am writing this is because my Steam account got hacked and stolen.**

Now lets get to the point. Steam Support, Probably the worst support system I have ever used not only because you cant email them or interact with a real person its mainly because of the confusing ways that they try to help.

One of those ways is by giving you different options that rarely ever help with your situation. Like for instance when I was trying to get my account back early today, (still haven't gotten it back) Steam gave me 5 options, one of the options was to send an email to the email address linked to my account. The only problem was that the person that stole my account changed the email. It did give me an option to use a previous email linked to the account except that didn't work and I still couldn't do anything about it.

Also the fact that you can't send them a direct email about your problem (Like a lot of other companies do) really annoys me. You can try your hardest to understand what ever the ***"helpful"*** support messages say but it will still amount to nothing because it will end up getting you nowhere with your situation. 

But seriously Steam fix your shit, and my account if possible. Thanks for coming to my ted talk
