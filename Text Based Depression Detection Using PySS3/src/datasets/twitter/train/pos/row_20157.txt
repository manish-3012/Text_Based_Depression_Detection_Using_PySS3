My school laptop is having major issues and idfk what to do So I've had this loaner computer for over a year now (I think they just forgot my computer broke??). And as is my luck, it's super laggy and buggy. But in the past two weeks, my laptop has had major issues twice. The first time, I was opening up a tab and when I did, my computer completely froze. Nothing at all worked and I couldn't shut it down in any way. I had to drain the battery to shut it down. I had to miss class because of it and now I'm having to contact my teacher because it's marked unexcused, luckily though I have video evidence of what was going on. Today, I was in class as normal. In the last few minutes, I had to get up to do something. When I got back it had froze and was stuck in an audio loop. I had to hold down the power button for over a minute for it to shut off

From day one of online classes my laptop would crash and/or bug out when I turned on my camera

My big concern is that I can only access class through that computer. I've tried on other devices but it doesn't work. So if my laptop decides to stop working altogether, I'm absolutely fucked
