Yoooo I almost got exposed in free period class by everyone   So it was an art class, basically free period. So me and the homies are at the corner of the classroom until something inside me happens. My nose starts bleeding crazy. 

  Thankfully nobody knew except a close friend of mine, cause I told him very discreetly. So I go to the bathroom and my mask from the inside is super red, looks like coughed-up blood. All of a sudden I did a big brain and decided to throw the mask in the classroom bin and went back. 

  5 minutes later someone went to the bun to throw out something and he freaked out, he told a bunch of boys and girls to check it out. It was my mask, I'm screwed. But then I remember my experience in Among Us, how I was always smooth during the emergency meetings, which helped me look innocent and not look like a freak. Nobody ever suspected me and my friend had my back.

Never again will I get a nose bleed, or else I'll be the imposter in class.
