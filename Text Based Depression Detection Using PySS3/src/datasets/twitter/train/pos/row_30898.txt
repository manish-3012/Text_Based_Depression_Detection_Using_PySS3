it's my birthday tomorrow and i feel sad, how do i stop being sad last year the same shit happened, i went out to eat with my parents and i just started crying for no reason and my mom got mad and didn't talk to me for the rest of the day.  I guess i'm just scared of getting older and i always look back and feel like i haven't accomplished anything, i really can't envision a future for myself and i just feel hopeless and like i have nothing to look forward to. Anyone else feel like this?
