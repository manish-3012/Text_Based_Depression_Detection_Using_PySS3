Liberals and conservatives They are both misunderstood. They are both wrong anything they say arenâ€™t facts, there opinions. And trump is pretty smart by knowing the only animals that need rights are pet, and by knowing that eating meat is not causing global warming. Biden is pretty smart for knowing that animals besides pets donâ€™t deserve rights, and itâ€™s not causing global warming. To be honest both of them are pretty stupid.
