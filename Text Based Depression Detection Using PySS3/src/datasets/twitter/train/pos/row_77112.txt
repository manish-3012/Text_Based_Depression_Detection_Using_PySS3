Feel Good Story I just did something and I feel so happy about it. So I bought this monitor a while back, but only used it once. Later I got a different monitor, so I packed this one up. some time flies but I put the monitor up for sale. Someone (we will name him Gary) finds it and asks for it. No negotiation, no nothing. Just the regular price. So we meet up, and I give him the monitor for some Cash. Gary was a young, extremely polite man. He was also a private in the US Air Force (thatâ€™s what he told me). He was so polite and respectful that it blew me away. Usually people here are super disrespectful and annoying, itâ€™s not even funny. So he took the monitor, and I took the money and I left. For some reason, I felt like I didnâ€™t do something right. Something inside me told me to give him his money back and let him keep the monitor for free. So I called him up around 3 minutes after I left to come back and meet up. He did, and then I proceeded to give him his money. He asked why, and I just sat there. I didnâ€™t know why, but something was just clawing at me to give it back. I just told him that the money was just a thanks for serving the country. As soon as I said that, he just turned to tears. It was beautiful. As it turns out, he had just comeback from a tour in the Middle East, and he was setting up his new apartment. He was just overcome with joy it was just, amazing to see. As I left I could still see Gary and his massive smile across his face. I felt like I had done something wonderful, yet I still didnâ€™t know what drove me to give it to him. Gary, I love you man, and to those who serve, thank you for your service!

P.S - My grammar is gonna be garbage I just finished a 2500 word essay Iâ€™m about done with English
