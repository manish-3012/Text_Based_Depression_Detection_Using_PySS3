I don't know whats happening My legs don't seem to work correctly after I walk for more than a couple hours. I can barely walk to my computer desk 10 feet away form my bed. The doctor says there is nonthing wrong with my feet. I don't know why this is happening I'm 17 and I can't run. If I work I can't walk or do anything physical for almost a whole day. I know that I this might be a first world problem or something but it sucks.
