Mental illness Iâ€™m a teen guy with bipolar 1 who is on multiple medications and from my experience I havenâ€™t been treated by people too well because of it.

Most of my friends except for two have actually been there for me, everyone else just tells me to â€œsuck it upâ€ and â€œbe a manâ€ (words by my father).

Only people who are there for me in my family are my brother and my mom.

My ex who is also diagnosed with bipolar was treated, in my opinion, was also treated poorly by other people.

I have had multiple bad episodes that has ended up with me in the hospital.

Itâ€™s hard to be a teenager or just anyone with a mental illness but please hang in there. From my experience there are still a lot of good things in life. One thing that has kept me going is my love for nature and my aspirations to become a teacher to teach a new generation of teenagers when Iâ€™m older. Hang in there and take your meds and eventually it all gets better :)
