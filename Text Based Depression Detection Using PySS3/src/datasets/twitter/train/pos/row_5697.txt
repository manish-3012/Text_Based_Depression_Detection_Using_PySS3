Yâ€™all I just got my first 50% on a math test and I might have a breakdown Before this the worst grade I have ever gotten was a 74% (aka a C) and I just got a 50% on a math class and Iâ€™m feeling really bad. My parents gave me a pass (like I wonâ€™t get in trouble) on this one test, but Iâ€™m scared about what will happen next. I payed attention in my classes, and I donâ€™t know why I got it so wrong. My grade had gone down to a C, and I just donâ€™t know what to do. I just came back from some extra help class, and I feel worse. Before this every grade I got (overall grade) was an A, and I would feel bad because I get a 89 on a single test. Iâ€™m in a magnet school (a school for smart people) for STEM, and with every other class I have an A. Really I just need help
