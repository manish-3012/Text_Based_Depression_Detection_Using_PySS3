Screw the Telekom Ever since that pos company that has been known for extremely bad service installed optic fiber in our neighborhood, the internet only works if the stars align and you conduct a blood sacrifice.

The worst part is, they're not even my ISP! These absolute excuses of an enterprise make me suffer for their mistakes, and since I am not a customer of theirs I'm shit out of luck since I cannot complain. I am at least glad I don't pay their exorbitant prices just to be screwed over.
