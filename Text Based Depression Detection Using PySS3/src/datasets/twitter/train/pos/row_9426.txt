How do I mend the wound? A little background: I dated a girl for a year and neither of us were that good of people, I was considerably worse but we were both manipulative, we both lied and we cared more for ourselves than the other. After we broke up I was destroyed and just felt hallow because even though the relationship was toxic there was still a connection for a while. The breakup cost me all my close friends and I had nobody to rely on so I went about it in unhealthy ways, not eating for days, commenting on her posts in alt accounts, self harming and considering suicide. I eventually got to the point where I could live semi healthily after I apologized to her and we had one final conversation that went well and ended with us both apologizing to each other for what we'd done but it was online and we hadn't seen each other in person for months. She really did take a toll on me even though I knew I was worse than her and I ended up attempting suicide last Monday via overdose and after spending some time in a Psychiatric hospital I was transferred out of the school I was in and into another. The school I am in just so happened to have my ex in it and I will see her every day. I had two panic attacks on my first day and one was because of her, I cant look at her without wanting to kill myself and I really just wanna contact her to say that I don't want either of us to feel awkward, anxious, or angry when we see each other. I don't expect a friendship but I don't want us to hate each other or anything. I just want to be tolerated, not loved. How would I go about doing this for the sake of both of our mental healths?
