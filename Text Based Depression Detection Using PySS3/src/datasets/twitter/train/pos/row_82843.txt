so apparently that was a fucking lie this is probably gonna be a string of incoherent thoughts but idc

i really thought i was getting better

i honestly thought that if the day came, id be able to handle some amount of emotions and deal with them rather than just running away

but apparently not, 16 years old and i cant handle a little sadness

what a fucking bitch huh
