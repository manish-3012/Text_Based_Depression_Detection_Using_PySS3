Dear parents I love you but... Please understand that if i am answering your question, it doesn't mean that i am talking back

also, just because someone is older than me doesn't mean the person should be respected.  respect is something that isn't just given, it's earned.

if the door is locked, it doesn't mean that i am doing something bad. it just means that i need some privacy.  the same goes my phone.
for dear mom and dad, i won't do anything stupid. All I want is some privacy when I am texting or on call with someone.

please trust my life choices so i don't have to lie to you every time i am going out. I feel bad whenever i am lying to you, but deep down i know i won't get the permission if i don't lie it sucks.

if i am having a boyfriend or a girlfriend, it doesn't automatically make me a bad kid. it sucks that all the kids of my generation have to hide something as simple as this, most of the time.

my phone isn't the root of all evil, and taking away the phone doesn't really solve anything.  it just makes me feel more restless.  i am laughing at my phone, it doesn't mean i am flirting with someone.  i assure you, 9 out of 10 times, it's just a meme.


please stop comparing us to other kids.  it hurts whenever you do that.
