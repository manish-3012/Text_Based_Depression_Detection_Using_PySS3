Ladies and gentlemen, I need some advice. A few days ago, my boyfriend told me about how he was contemplating suicide. I've stepped in since then, and we're getting him the help he needs, but now he's saying the thoughts have come back. What's the best thing I can do for him right now? We play Minecraft as often as we can so he has something to focus on and we text practically nonstop most days. I can tell it helps, but our opportunities are pretty limited and we're both worried it'll come back while I can't do much for him. I want to know how to help him in between. Anything helps!
