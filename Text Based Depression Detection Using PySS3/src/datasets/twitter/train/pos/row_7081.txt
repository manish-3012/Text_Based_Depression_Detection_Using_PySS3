I can finally rest now... No, I'm not dying. It's just that The PS5 and the New Xbox series x and s has brought something I never thought. When the PS5 launched, Xbox Said Congrats on the New Console. And when Series X and S launched Playstation sent a gif showing friendship. It's over boys, the console war has ended in peace. We can rest now defending Which one was good and which one was bad, The Next Generation.
 of humans Will live in a world where The console wars doesn't exist. As a Xbox Fan I Might try out The Playstation 5. And You Playstation Fans Might want to try out Halo infinite, It's gonna be good. Their making it 100% the best, And the soundtrack rocks. 

As A New Generation of Console are Born, The War Stopped and Everything was good, Everything was great. Now all gamers shall be united Like it should of been. We now have 2 things connecting us together,  Knowing both consoles are great in their own ways, and That We have All an X button, Even the ones on the ads. (Still Mobile gamers don't exist, Unless you played like minecraft pe you get counted as a Player.)

Goodnight y'all, We shall rest and listen to the birds chirp a song tomorrow.
