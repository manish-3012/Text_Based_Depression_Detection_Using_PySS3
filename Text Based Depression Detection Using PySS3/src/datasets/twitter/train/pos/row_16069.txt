Should I stop talkikng to her? It was 1 year ago when I met a girl online, troughout the course of the year i started to kind of fall in love with her, I have had crushes before and its nothing like this, but she lives far away, she's 2 years older than me, and she is incredibly out of my league.

I have started to spiral into deep feelings of sadness and dread, and started having suicidal thoughts after seeing her constantly going from boyfriend to boyfriend, forgetting about me for a couple days, ignoring me, etc. I know this is natural stuff for a girl to do, but she means so much to me and I love her so much that it really does break my heart.

I dont have many friends with whom I can fully discuss this, but one I do have adviced me to cut ties with her and stop talking to her, which may be a good idea?? Maybe?? 

I am really not sure, as even though she hurts me she also makes me happy every once in a while, and I would feel so lonely without the stupid hope that we might end up together that's always in the back of my mind.

I really dont know what to do, also, she does care a bit about me, as a friend at least, so I would have to explain the situation to her, it would hurt her if i just stopped talking suddenly, that would be a huge asshole move.

I am asking my fellow teenagers, what should I do????
