Anyone else feeling like a burden for not having a job? I was accepted into my dream education in university this year. I absolutely can't wait to go.
However, because I am so young, they decided to let me start in february, instead of this september with the rest.

This was unexpected, and I'm now sitting with 5 more months on my hands. It's been around 19 days since I received my acceptance letter.

I am of course actively searching for a job. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, so there isn't a whole lot. But I'm trying. I'm also making sure to be productive around the house. 
However, I still feel like my parents think I'm being lazy, and a burden to them for not having a job yet. They keep asking if 'this' and 'this' place as replied back, and 'when I will get a job already?'. My dad's girlfriend keeps giving me the stink eye. It's kind of unnerving.
I just hope I find something soon.

Anyone else feel like this?
