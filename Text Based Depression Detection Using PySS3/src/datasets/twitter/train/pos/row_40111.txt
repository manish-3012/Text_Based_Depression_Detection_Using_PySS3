I need help. I'm going trought some hard times I recently changed school, and have no friends. I fell in love with a girl and after getting the courage to talk to her she ignored it and talked about other stuff. I wan't to do some sports because i can't stop crying at home about what happened during day because i have nothing to keep myself busy. My tests go wrong because i can't study in this condition. Also i'm thinking in going to a psychlogist because i'm literally being eaten from the inside every second of my days. And btw i've always been strong and good at almost everything i did, i just don't know what happaned to my old me.
