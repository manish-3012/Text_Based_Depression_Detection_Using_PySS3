I like one of my brothers friend and I dont know how to get close to him. Any advice? Yes, like in the title I have known my brothers friend (we will call him Max) since I was little. And somehow I've always seemed to sometimes tag along in their group. But now I've had a crush on Max for a year and I want to get closer to him. We havent specified if we are friends. He says aquantences, but i want to be more than just aquantences. How can I get closer to him?
