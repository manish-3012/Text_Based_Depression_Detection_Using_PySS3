The u.s. army ad kills me First of all it seems mighty convenient that there is an ad for the u.s. army ad in a social group full of teenagers getting out of high school. Second, I keep thinking that it's a new cod game but I keep getting disappointed. All in all I hate the army recruitment ads on here.
