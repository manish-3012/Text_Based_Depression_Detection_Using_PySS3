I find it funny seeing people complain about not being able to get a PS5 because they sold out Like lmao, just wait a month or two, and anyways if you want to complain at someone donâ€™t complain at the folks buying them in bulk, complain at PlayStation for having this (apparently quite good) business strategy of not selling enough initially.
