Me and my gf of 9 months broke up This isnâ€™t one of those â€œall women are hoesâ€ or â€œwomen ainâ€™t shitâ€. We broke up cause we werenâ€™t right for each other. It started from a close friendship and we are both on good terms with each other so we might stay friends just not dating. Iâ€™m actually comforted knowing well still be friends with each other.
