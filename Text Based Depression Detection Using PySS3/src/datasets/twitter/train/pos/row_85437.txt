This world robs us of our conscious awareness by:  making us take things way to seriously, being stuck in the past, being ruled by our emotions and the fear of being criticized.

If you don't already know our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life. Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe.

Did he just say infinite?
Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state.

Did he just say cosmic energy!?
Yes I did, and on the energetic side you can observe this cosmic energy inside of you when you get goosebumps from watching inspiring movies, listening to moving or exciting music, feeling eager, thinking about someone you love and more.

I've found many names for this energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, PitÄ«, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps and many more.

If you want to learn how to really tap into this energy here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ds9BKmuT_7I) for you.

On a less deeper side, you can open yourself up to it by:
Letting go of all the baggages from your past, 
Not taking everything so seriously,
Stop letting yourself be ruled by your Emotions (mind over matter)
And by not blocking yourself from living life because of the fear of criticism from others.

One or all of these things combined will take away all of your power that you have from the now, your present.
