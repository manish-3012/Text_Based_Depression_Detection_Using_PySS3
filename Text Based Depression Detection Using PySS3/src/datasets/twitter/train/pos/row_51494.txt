An assignment that i need to make tomorrow I did not make all the assignment on all the second semesters english lessons because i don't want to go to school and get covid and i want to play games all day, this was online school and now that schools are open. All that day is that the monkey is behind on my brains wheels, so now that the panic monsters coming in and the monkey goes into his hiding spot, well some of it is still on the wheel. So, what should i do to encourage my self to do all the assignment?
