My parents just pulled the good ole â€œbecause I birthed you do what I sayâ€ on me So I was starting to build my pc (which I sold a 5 year old paddle board that they bought on eBay) and I was building it and talking with my friends then my dad comes home and I was building it in my room. Then when he asked what I was doing I told I was building it in my room. Then he says no to it I ask why and he says that my mother will never allow it I ask him why he says just no. I was a bit upset so I gave him some attitude and I now realize thatâ€™s a first world problem mentality of â€œIâ€™m so mad that I canâ€™t have my pc in my roomâ€ but at the moment I was pissed off. So later he tells me that he doesnâ€™t want me giving attitude and tell me that I should be happy I should have it because I sold their 5 year old paddle board (they gave me full permission to sell it donâ€™t worry) and that they could take it away if they wanted to. Then I said â€œthatâ€™s like u just saying because I birthed obey meâ€ and he said thatâ€™s exactly what this is and then told to stop giving him attitude with my look. When I asked if he wanted me to smile he said yes and I reminded him lasted time I pretended to be happy and smile at he he yelled at me to â€œwipe that shit eating grin off my face. Sorry for this being so long I just really want to rant about this.
