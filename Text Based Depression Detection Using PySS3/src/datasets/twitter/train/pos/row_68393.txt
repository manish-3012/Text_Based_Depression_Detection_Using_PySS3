Ok so according to my studies, the ultimate gf would be a giant furry otter gf Because she:

- Can and will cuddle you
- Has soft fur
- Floats in water and can help you in the improbable case you'd drown
- Cuddles
- Cuddles but when sleeping. Also could use her as a very soft bed.
- Cuddles once again but this time floating on water.
- Otter noises.
- Did I already say cuddles?
