Please donate to ZEvent2020! So what is ZEvent? I'm glad you ask! It's a French caritative event on Twitch hosted by Zerator. It reunites all the biggest French speaking streamers for 50 hours strait to collect as much donations as possible for an organisation. Last year they collected more that 3.5Mâ‚¬ to the Pasteur Institute and the fight against cancer, making it the biggest caritative stream on the history of Twitch. This year, they are collecting for Amnesty International. Please donate at least 1â‚¬ (or $ or whatever your local currency is), it really helps a lot. Also, please spread the word to your friends, the more people there is, the best it is obviously. Anyway, we finally have some good stuff happening in this shitty year, I really hope it will matter a lot, it means a lot to me.
