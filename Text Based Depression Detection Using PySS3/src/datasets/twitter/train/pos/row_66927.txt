I am confusion My crush knows I like her, and she wants to date me, amazing right! Wrong, we only get to talk over text and school and she thinks that that's not enough time for a proper relation ship(which I kinda agree with) because her parents are very strict and don't let her out, so, we agreed that if we still like each other by the time she's allowed out that we'll d8, also, it gave me an ego boost kinda.
