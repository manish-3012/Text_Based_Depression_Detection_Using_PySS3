I shouldâ€™ve never told my best friend I liked her I didnâ€™t even want to. I always do stupid shit without thinking of the consequences. I did it in the worst way and I knew she didnâ€™t like me or hardly even girls. She was the first person in a while I was close with, she never made me feel bad about my flaws and I was so comfortable with her. She was so kind to me. We hung out all the time and I know I made a mistake- I apologized and all about anything that couldâ€™ve made her feel bad but she just ignored me. She ignored me while I was crying right in front of her and yeah it makes me kind of mad that she said it didnâ€™t matter and that she wouldnâ€™t hurt me and then did that. She showed no emotion and didnâ€™t even respond just texted a friend. But I still miss her. I miss her so much. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to lose this person but it feels like I already have. I was getting over her and just wanted to be friends and blew it. Everything reminds me of when we were together and I canâ€™t get over it. I just want to somehow fix things and I canâ€™t move on. She lives right next door too- I just I feel like I ruined something that couldâ€™ve been great and god I hate it. It canâ€™t be fair why does one mistake make something disappear just like that??? Why canâ€™t I go back or anything? I donâ€™t know if I should talk to her again but I feel like itâ€™s really over. I donâ€™t wanna be a pest or bother her. I dont want to be weird. I just canâ€™t let her go for some reason and I canâ€™t even bear the thought of it. I just wish I got closure even if she didnâ€™t want me around anymore.
