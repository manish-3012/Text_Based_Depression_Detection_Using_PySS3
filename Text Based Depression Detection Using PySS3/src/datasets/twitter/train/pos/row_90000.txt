Haha hey guys it would be so funny if the leftist mob bullied a black woman off of twitter Right? I mean its not like thats what they do every day. Letitia wright got bullied off Twitter because she was wondering about a chemical in the covid vaccine and was immediately labeled an anti-vaxxer. Im not even anti vax. Or that time when BLM burned down a black business owners restaurant in portland after he criticized the "peaceful" protests and when twitter and everyone said nothing about it. But i guess they can't be racist can they. Yeah why would i be upset at the leftist mob when all they are is good, not like its a giant extremist cesspool that constantly wants to make me puke at every turn.
