Started crying while sitting alone at lunch and got made fun of Ever since school started iâ€™ve been sitting alone at lunch. Just like last year. As I was eating an overwhelming amount of memories and emotion came over me and I just felt so alone. Even though hundreds were around me.
Being lonely around lots of people is worse than being alone by yourself. I excused myself to the bathroom and everyone was staring at me and laughing and I just stayed in the bathroom until lunch was over and intentionally skipped a part of class and cried more.
