Screw hookups and sex! I want a friend group where we can laugh with each other, I want midnight cravings and go to the convenient store late at night while gazing at the neon signs filling the dark sky and purchase some cheap ramen, I want cuddles with my boyfriend, I want to go on a walk while listening to my music playlist while the sun is slowly setting â˜¹ï¸ itâ€™s totally okay if youâ€™re not a virgin but treating it as a flex/seeing a person weird for being a virgin is just wrong
