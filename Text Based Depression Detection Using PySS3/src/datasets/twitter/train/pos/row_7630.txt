What's the craziest shit that happened in your school? Mine was 3 years ago, when I was a lil Grade 7. Two students who are in the same grade level as me had a fight on the overpass outside the school. It ended with one getting stabbed with a pocket knife. Worse, I was able to see the victim being carried by our security guard, with a noticeable blood splotch on his uniform, while we were eating out lunch right next to the clinic. Since we (me and my friends) were boy scouts before, we were ordered to form a line to prevent anyone from the crowd going too far into the clinic. Shit was crazy back then.

The reason as to how it ended up in a bloody and gruesome brawl was the fact that the aggressor (the guy with the knife) was bullied constantly by the other dude. One day, they had an altercation, and the other dude challenged him to fight on a location, which is the overpass that traverses over a main road. My friend got an ominous hint from the aggressor before shit went down, repeating the words in an angry tone "Naa koy special weapon bai", which means in English "I have a special weapon dude".
