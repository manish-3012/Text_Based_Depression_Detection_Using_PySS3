I don't feel like I've felt happiness So as the title says, I don't feel like I feel true happiness. Now, this isn't all the story, what I mean by this is that I only feel happy doing one thing, spending time with my best friend. Every other thing almost seems meaningless, for example, I laugh if I hear a good joke or have a good time if I play a good game. But all of this doesn't feel like I'm feeling joy or something I just feel temporarily happy.  Also, last week was the first time in a long time I felt really happy.

I don't feel like I am depressed but sometimes it feels like that is why I feel this way and I don't know what to think. Also, I am just becoming an adolescent too so I don't know if this is just why or what.
