You guys all sound like the same person but with 2,000,000 alt accounts Seriously, everyone of you here are talk and act the same, itâ€™s like youâ€™re all just robots trying to mimic humans. You all use the same memes, you all use the same comebacks, you all try so hard to get clout on Reddit, you all are incapable of being funny or humorous, you are all the same person but cloned 2,000,000 times. Seriously, why canâ€™t you just be original on this sub? Not hard is it?
