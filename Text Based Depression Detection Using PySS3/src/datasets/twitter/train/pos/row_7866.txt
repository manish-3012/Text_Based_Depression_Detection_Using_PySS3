How good is animal crossing new horizons? I'm currently on a budget, so earning 60$ and spending it to a game that i will do not like sucks

I played wild world on the DS. I see people saying that new horizons is the worst AC by far and has the less features. I would've bought this game a year ago or last month. But because of the reviews like this. I am still skeptical. 


But I want to see the players who actually played the game..so is it good? How enjoyable is it to someone who has played wild world / New Leaf?
