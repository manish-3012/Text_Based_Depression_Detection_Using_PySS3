Did anyone else have work due during spring break? I'm doing online school so sometimes assignments due dates get messed up which I understand for the most part but last Friday was the start of spring break for me and I was told that I wouldn't be having any work due during spring break. I went about my spring break without checking any of my classes.

Today my mom got on my ass about overdue work which confused me because from my understanding I wouldn't have any. I checked and to my surprise, I was very behind in all of my classes except for Algebra (Thank God). I'm now behind on all of my classes by at least 3 assignments each and since it's Monday assignments are going to continue to come out.

My initial idea for this post was a question, not a rant, so did this happen to anyone else besides me?
