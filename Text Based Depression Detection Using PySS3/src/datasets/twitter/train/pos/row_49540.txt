Deaths that I didn't cry to What you're going to see now is a list of sad deaths (fictional and non-fictional) that I didn't cry to.

Oh, and MAJOR SPOILER ALERT FOR LOTS OF THINGS IN HERE. Also there are a lot of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JJBA) deaths here. I don't sort stuff, I just go with what comes first in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Prince/Prophet (Dragonhearted)
* The Prince/Prophet's Tutor (Take Back The Night)
* Caesar Zeppeli (JJBA: BT)
* Iggy (JJBA: SC)
* Jotaro Kujo (JJBA: SO)
* Narancia Ghirga (JJBA: VA)
* Jonathan Joestar (JJBA: PB)
* Ryohei Higashikata/Josuke's Grandfather (JJBA: DiU)
* Baron Zeppeli (JJBA: PB)
* George Joestar II (JJBA: Pre-BT)
* Bruno Bucciarati (JJBA: VA)
* Peter Parker (Infinity War)
* Tony Stark (Endgame)

These are all the people I could come up with.
