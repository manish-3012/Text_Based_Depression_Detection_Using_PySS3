Why I u/Alvin_Whee should be president over r/teenagers: Hello I am the first candidate to be president over r/teenagers, here is why you should vote on me:

1. I will make sure your depression is cured by saying "dont be sad" on your sad reddit post.

2. I will make sure you will open up reddit instead of joining your online class. I will do this by banning Zoom and Microsoft teams.

3. I don't know anything about politics. 

4. I will reveal the krabby patty formula. 

5. We all will be monke.
