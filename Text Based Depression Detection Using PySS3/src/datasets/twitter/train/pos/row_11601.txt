Need some help.... I've been talking with my crush lately and he's sending me mixed signals like one day he says "go to sleep early I'll wake up soon tomorrow so that we can talk", and another day he says things like "this girl is cute but I have 0 chance with her depressed life" like what is that supposed to mean? but either way we talk all day long but idk if he likes me or not.
