(Question) Teenagers, how do you cope with your depression? Many teens, (including me), have faced or are facing depression at some point in their lives. I (and many other redditors, I am sure) am fairly interested to see how these teens have dealt with or are dealing with their depression. If you are currently in a situation related to depression in any way, remember, it gets better! You aren't alone!
