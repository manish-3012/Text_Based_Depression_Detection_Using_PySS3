i need advice one of my "friends" used to sell stuff to me. he owes me $100+. he's been saying he'll pay me back for the longest time and now im fed up. i asked him respectfully and he replied "i dont owe you shit, thats your mamas money broke bitch." that pisses me off and im about to beat tf out of that kid. he's older than me but i'm bigger and way stronger than him. only problem is, he's my neighbor and in our neighborhood, there's a lot of gossip and if he calls the cops im fucked. nothing verbal is gonna make him give me my money so im not sure what to do. anybody got advice?
