Maybe my first car I'm riding around in a 2008 Subaru Outback right now. Its been sitting in a backyard for a year. Dirty, dog hairs and the driver's seat has a tear in it. Other than that, it's looking good. They're asking for 4.000. Why am I telling you? Idk. Should you care? Probaly not, but I am excited
