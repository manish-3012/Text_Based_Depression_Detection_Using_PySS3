It really pisses me off how someone actually has the audacity to do shit like this. 2020 totally could never be better. ðŸ¥°ðŸ™„ðŸ˜’ Sooo, my dad works out of town/state and rents out motel rooms. Yesterday he went back to his motel in some city he was working in and his truck was broken into. 

They broke his window, stole all his tools that in total were worth $500-$700 (it may not seem like a lot but he still has to replace all that stuff now, but I guess it was his fault for having his stuff there and to be fair he had a huge lock on his toolbox.ðŸ˜•)  and also slashed his tires so, yeah. 

That person really thought they were doing smthn. ðŸ¤—-ðŸ™„ðŸ–•ðŸ¼

But it like really amazes me how disgusting people are at this point. Imagine slashing someoneâ€™s tires because you just felt like it. I could never. ðŸ¤¢
