A guy i know suddenly stopped interacting with us and is ghosting us and iâ€™ve no clue how to approach this. I started frequently playing online with two others as a trip ever since COVID.

 We had our issues and one of them had some real problems but recently things have been going great with him. Recently we bought a game and shit and played for 2 nights and he seemed more upbeat than ever. Tuesday we scheduled a time, he said nothing but from our experiences that usually means ok or that he has no objections.

Later at night we waited 2 hours for him in VC and he was not there. We asked him a few times if heâ€™ll hop on or not but we got no reply.
We know his brother and asked him if anything is wrong but his Brother said everything is fine and heâ€™s still as upbeat as ever.

Now itâ€™s been like this for a few days he sees our messages but doesnâ€™t reply whatsoever. We donâ€™t know what we did cause we all stopped roasting and teasing him months ago.

This guy has had a few meltdowns in the past but back then i knew why and it was mostly our fault but this time we did abso-fucking-lutely nothing.

Do i just leave it be? Or try to reach out again?
Also we might just be superstitious but he has been going offline even when we accidentally open our laptops and go online.
