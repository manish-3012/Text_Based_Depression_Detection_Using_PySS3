I donâ€™t want to take this class anymoreeeee I got accepted into a Culinary arts class which was kinda difficult to get into because you had to sign up early in order to make sure you get a spot in the class. Well, ever since school started I was first put into Theater class and I ended up really enjoying it and I think Iâ€™ll really grow from a shy introverted kid to a more outgoing introvert lol. I donâ€™t wanna be in the culinary class anymore especially since itâ€™s all gonna be online for the rest of the year (only that class) and ehhh Iâ€™m just not feeling it. Should I tell my counselor about it? I feel nervous though
