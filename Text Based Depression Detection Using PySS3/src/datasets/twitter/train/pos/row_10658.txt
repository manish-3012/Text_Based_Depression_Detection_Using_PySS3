I think I just got sexually harassed on roblox.  All I did was ask some girls to stop talking about their "bussy" constantly because it was revolting, and this is roblox where there is most likely more children. Then they proceeded to make remarks on mine. I might be overreacting, but I feel like vomiting. I feel so sick. I hate these kind of people, they have no regard for others. I wish I could shove graters into their mouths. Fricking disgusting worthless pieces of trash, someone should wrap rubber bands on their fingers until they shrivel up and fall off, then they wont be able to use a keyboard ever again.
