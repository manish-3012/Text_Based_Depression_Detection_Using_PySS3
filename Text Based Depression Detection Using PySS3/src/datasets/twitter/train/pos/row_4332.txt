I always knew the fortnite player base was cringey as hell but GODDAMN I was at my dads friends house and their kid was playing that game on the couch next to me and I could actually hear the voice chat screams through this kids headset, idk if the volume was just loud or if it was just the kids on the other end but Iâ€™m not quite sure how people can listen to that and actually enjoy a game ;-;
