Hard to title. Thatâ€™s the name of the poem. We had an assignment to make a poem about â€œdigital zombiesâ€ in all honesty itâ€™s sad but true. Here was mine. I know kinda boomer af:
Stuck to screens, our necks forward lean
Leaving pain outside unseen
Not only physical but mentally too
Our whirring brains left to stew
Thoughts of what they think of us
Millions of faces we fill with trust
This trust is something possibly untrue
As we have no real contact, just the screen and you
The part that hurts me the worst 
Is that millions of other burst
With trust that is true and real 
But we never understand the big deal
See those others are people who stand tall
They walk and talk and socialize with all
They understand the pain inside
But you just push them to the side
Because youâ€™re too busy to look away
And see the light of a shining day
You lose opportunity of love and acceptance
Just because you are gaining credits
The beauty of everything around and outside
Can help heal the pain all on the inside
You see the heart of the Earth herself
When you find and meet somebody else
Somebody who is true and dear
Somebody who is actually near
They are someone who put down the screen
And went to discover their world unseen
You met them because you gave a chance
To the possibility of another stance
This will never happen if you donâ€™t look up
Instead you would just feel stuck
Inside your mind with none to confide
Because they are fake and they said they needed a break
A break from what, Itâ€™s sadly true
But they never really cared for you,
Maybe they did but they regret 
They canâ€™t see you for who they met
They might miss someone theyâ€™ve never known
And from that their knowledge has grown
That people hurt and keep it inside
So that they donâ€™t have to realize
They are wasting away in a world untrue
They are wasting away because they met you
They dedicate their life to someone they donâ€™t know 
Someone who is loved by all who know
They think that if they gain enough followers
They can live up to you through gaining hundreds of dollars
 Just to be fake a mask with a smile
Just to be fake for only a little while
But this adds up again and again they are not themselves
They let the screen win.
