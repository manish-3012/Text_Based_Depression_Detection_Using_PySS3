Guys I need some advice on my feelings So Iâ€™m in college and at the top of my game. Iâ€™ve worked out, I got excellent grades for once last semester, I should be happy. But ngl I feel really alone. Over break I got to spend time with my family and old high school buddies it was awesome.

At college Iâ€™ve got one good friend and heâ€™s staying home for a while. I got back, and I saw everyone with their friends and my heart sank. All those good feelings and confidence gone. Yeah, if I ask them, theyâ€™d hang with me. But they never ask me. Who cares if Iâ€™m doing well, Iâ€™m still just a loser socially. I know itâ€™s not true but I canâ€™t help feeling that way sometimes
