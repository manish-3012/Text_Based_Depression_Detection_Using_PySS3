I went out with the girl i like :) We both walk our dogs and she's liked me since we met last december (i have too lol) and we haven't seen each other since because lockdown and taking dogs out at different times. Well 3 days ago she found my insta (her friend is in my german and they both saw me and she kinda hooked us up in a way lol) . Anyway we went out with her dog because we're not allowed to meet because of my town rules. Anyway we kissed and it was amazing and then today after work i took her dinner because she'd had a stressful day at work :)) im super happy and im walking her home from college everyday next week
