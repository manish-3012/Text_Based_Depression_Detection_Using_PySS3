Why is English literature required in our school curriculums? Like actually wtf??? â€œNow what do you think the author meant by â€œthe wind blows gently in the night sky against the trees and grassâ€?â€

EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT JOB THAT IS USEFUL FOR!

I donâ€™t want to read about some cross dresser from 1600 and analyze what his literary devices were.

I can understand writing essays and reading but all this other useless crap? At least make it selective and not required ffs. I PLAN TO BE A BIOLOGIST OR ELECTRICIAN
