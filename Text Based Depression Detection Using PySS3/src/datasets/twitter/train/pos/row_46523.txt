I feel like shit Ik this is gonna be a kinda long boring thing no one reads but i need to rant. 

I feel like shit and i hate things rn. I don't have it as bad as some others but still. Im getting shitty marks in school, my only friend group is fighting with me, im chasing a girl who clearly doesnt like me and is way out of my league, and this one girl litterally just talked to me (after being told to by the teacher) and now i like her cause its weird a girl talked to me. Im not trynna sound like all feel bad for me or anything i just wanan vent cause if feel shitty and cant say any of this to people i acctually know. 

Tl dr life sucks rn
