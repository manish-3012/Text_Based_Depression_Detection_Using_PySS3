COVID - my worst nightmare So since Covid February when Covid spread like wildfire ,we have all  locked down -and masked up ( for the most part ) . Why ? Covid spreads by water particles getting into the body from talking , eating , breathing , kissing etc etc etc 

Iâ€™m 16 , was 15y/o at the time of first lockdown - I should be in my prime .. right ? Iâ€™m sure I can relate to a lot of teens here and say this year was supposed to be a year to enjoy . In reality ; not so much.

Whatâ€™s got me the worst is that I planned to have a serious relationship and maybe even s*x this year. I had worked very hard for this the year before so I could slack this year (2020) ( thatâ€™s how my countryâ€™s school works ) . It made me super depressed, caused self harm - all in the hope I could have a good next year . I havenâ€™t kissed someone in nearly a year now , havenâ€™t met friends in 3 months . I havenâ€™t wanted fun more than ever before . 

Will it get better ? Will i still have a fun teenage years ? Do you think itâ€™s safe to meet up with friends and girls despite Covid ?
