is being over affectionate annoying like ever since I was little I continuously give hugs and kisses to my mom lul and I'm genuinely wondering if you think that'd be annoying. my mom seems fine with it but I don't wanna annoy a (possible) future s/o with kisses every 0.4secs. ik it depends on the person but I wanna get a general idea hahah :p
