Here's something that kind of annoys me I hate it when I'm on a call with one of my friends and one of my family members will just walk in like "who are your talking to?" And when I say a friend they go on with "what friend?" So I tell them the name of that friend just for them to get mad at me and say shit like "you say that like I'm supposed to know who they are" like broski you just fucking asked me what friend I was talking to it's not my fault you don't wanna pay attention to my life unless it's a chance to get me in trouble.
