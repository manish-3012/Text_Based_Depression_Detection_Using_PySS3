Just found yet another insecurity Basically I was checking myself out in the mirror, been feeling great since I met my gf right, well I just came to the realisation that I have terrible cheekbones. Like they don't stick out at all and they're like way behind my nose if I go to feel there.

I have an okay jawline but I have pathetic cheekbones. Plus I'm overweight so that definitely doesn't help.

Now is there anything I can do about this? I've heard of mewing but I don't know if that's real or worth it. Would this get better as I grow up? I'm 14
