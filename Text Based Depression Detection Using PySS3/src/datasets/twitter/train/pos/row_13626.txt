I always feel out of place Yes, sorry for the rant. I know itâ€™s the new year but I just want to get this off myself. 

I never feel that I belong in a group of friends. But bot in a I-donâ€™t-belong-not-like-other-people-from-a-young-adult-book kind of I donâ€™t belong. I do want to be in. I donâ€™t think that I am uncool with my peers or Iâ€™m shy, because I am not. Very not. Although the thing is I donâ€™t really have any friend, like a close friend that I can confide with. 

It gotten even worse now that everything is online. I donâ€™t have any online friends really. Maybe some but I rarely talk to them because somehow Iâ€™m worse online that irl. My life feels empty honestly at this point. I just wanna be in a group. 

TL;DR: Iâ€™m ranting about how I donâ€™t belong in any group of friend when Iâ€™m not even that shy. Now, that everythingâ€™s online, itâ€™s worse because Iâ€™m shy online. My life feels empty and I donâ€™t have a point in posting this to the world.
