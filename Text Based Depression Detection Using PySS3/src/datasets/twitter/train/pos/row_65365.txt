Iâ€™m so sick of feeling like Iâ€™m not actually liked and that the people who say they like me are eventually going to hate me SMALL THINGS LITERALLY THE SMALLEST OF THINGS will make me think â€œoh welp proof they hate meâ€ 

I hate myself so much and I canâ€™t stand this constant anxiousness around my relationships with others. I feel like such a bother to everyone around me

I have plenty of friends and even a boyfriend. I shouldnâ€™t feel this way when people are genuinely lonely without anyone

Does anyone else feel this way? I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and Iâ€™m so tired
