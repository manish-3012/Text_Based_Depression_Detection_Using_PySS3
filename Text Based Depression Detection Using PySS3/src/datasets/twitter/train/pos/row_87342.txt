Hereâ€™s how to stop apps like Spotify,Steam,discord, etc from opening when you just turned on your computer! (This is for Microsoft computers) 1. Go to setting and click Apps

2. On the sidebar youâ€™ll see the option â€œStartupâ€

3. Click on â€œStartupâ€

3. Click on the apps you donâ€™t want starting up automatically when you turn on your PC.

P.S. I donâ€™t know if people already knew this buts itâ€™s been a meme for awhile so I assumed a lot of you out there donâ€™t. I hope this helped!
