We just got banned from a subreddit and it was the highlight of our year You can look at our post history to see what we were posting.

Basically, someone said they shipped a 12 year old and a character who is minimum 15, so the Twitter fandom started ratioing the subreddit. Weâ€™re not part of the Twitter fandom, but a lot of our moots are, so we joined in. It was such a good time, shame it canâ€™t go on any longer.

Anyway, donâ€™t ship 12 year olds with 15 year olds.
