Hey, you. Nobody cares that you hate TikTok.  I really don't give a shit about getting downvoted, I just need a place to rant.

 As a platform, I think that TikTok is an acquired taste, but it's not for me. Imo it's gotten so big that its mainstream has turned itself into what I could describe as "America's Funniest Home Videos". The days of the Hit or Miss, or the old furry wars on the app were cycled through the wash so many times that content on the platform became bland. What seemed like a novel idea and great source for memes in late 2018 into 2019 started to fizzle out, and for that I can't get too mad. That's just what happens when something goes mainstream. The dancing and the (in my opinion) blander skits, and videos that I would've called vine memes 5 years ago, are kind of cringe, but whatever. 

 What pisses me off is the people that have this *"I hate TikTok, hehe yes we aren't normies"* mentality that has swarmed YouTube comments, and Instagram pages, and even here. I can't believe how many times I've seen the same *"UsE mE aS a 'NoT fRoM tiKToK' bUtToN"* in the comments for a song that's just a bop that happened to be used on TeekTeek. Because people who actually come from TikTok are posting __"who's here from TikTok June 2020 plz like ok bye :)"__ are being snuffed by the people who are saying __"who's not here from TikTok look we're elitists we are cultured because we watched a rather popular anime series and like the OP please like owo"__ , to the point where there is little to no conversation about the ACTUAL FUCKING SONG. Its as thought-provoking as saying "2020 anyone?" It seems absurd to me that the same dudes who complain about people from TorkTop riddle the places that aren't TinTin with news about TifTobs. And this is just the most apparent example of a growing "us vs. them" mentality that's going on in our *Society* today, but I'm not going to bore you with that shit. Ok I'm done.

Please turn this into a copypasta.
