So my life has taken a great turn for the better So like some may remember my posts a while ago about my abusive parents and that whole fun adventure, but a couple of months ago I finally got out of that house and I no longer have to deal with my dad and step mom and I actually get to do things for once and lifeâ€™s been good I got back with one of my exâ€™s a couple weeks ago and yea itâ€™s been great I love her and the family members who got custody of me

Thanks for listening to my life story but very much shortened
