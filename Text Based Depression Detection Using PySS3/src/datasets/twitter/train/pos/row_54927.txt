Why my life sucks So I have this friend who I was really good friends with. She was one of my closest friends last year, and even though we had a few issues in the beginning I really cared about her. About 2 weeks before COVID and quarantine I started to have feelings for her, and I asked her out. She the proceeded to say â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€ and â€œI need timeâ€ for a month and a half. During that time our friendship became strained and awkward, and I straight up hit on her at times which made her uncomfortable. And eventually she finally said straight up no. After leading me on for a month and a half. After that there was a while where we didnâ€™t really talk to each other, but at the beginning of the school year this year we started taking again. Then like two months ago she started avoiding me and not answering my texts. I confronted her about it and we fought for awhile and we told each other how the we had each hurt each other and we apologized and agreed to give each other a month of space before resuming our friendship. I assumed we were all good now. I gave her the month, then I texted her, â€œhey itâ€™s been a month. are we ok now?â€ She read my text and didnâ€™t answer. So I gave her a few more days. She still wouldnâ€™t talk to me. I texted her again only this time she had blocked me. I tried to talk to her and she kept avoiding me. I finally asked one of our mutual friends to tell her to talk to me and she told my friend, â€œew effff noâ€. And now Iâ€™m deeply hurt because one of my best friends just abandoned me because I liked her and she dragged it out and made me think I had a chance with her.
