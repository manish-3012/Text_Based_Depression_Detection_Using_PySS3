Me a 3:03 am exactly... Me: ugh I should go to bed I've been on reddit for like 2 hours...

Me: lays down for 3 minutes 

My brain: BUT WAIT!!!! I JUST THOUGHT OF THIS EXACT POST

Me: gets up and makes this post... it's now 3:08 am

Me: gets lost in reddit cuz there was one message in inbox from some guy in Australia I can only talk to at night.
