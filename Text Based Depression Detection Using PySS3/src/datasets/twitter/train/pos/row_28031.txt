Had plans to chill with gf tonight and i got a pimple under my nose, i have a ton of homework and my pancakes were cold this morning How are your guysâ€™ day?

(Like obviously thatâ€™s not a big deal in comparison to everything going on but like it still makes me disappointed and all)

I kinda considered school to be optional for past 2 months and now Iâ€™m getting bit in the ass for it. My grades suck ass this year and in my Junior year itâ€™s *kinda* important. My social life and everything is doing very well Iâ€™m pretty happy but my grades suck ass and I get stressed about the future and homework and djhsjswjsj ya know?
