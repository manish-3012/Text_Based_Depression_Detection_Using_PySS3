Dose anyone know what im doin wrong? ( school work problem) its one of those 1= 15 2=20 whats 3= sort of things but I have to write an equation. the problem gives me 1=13 2=17.5 I came up with the equation d=n\*4+9 n being 1 or 2 and d being 13 or 17.5 the problem is that if I put .5 after the four it puts a .5 after 13 and makes 17 into 18 and it continues on that trend, how do I get the correct equation or what am I doing wrong.
