Rare aesthetics, do you know them? Usually on instagram rare aesthetics have popped in and have reminded me to few moments, can you relate to some?

â€¢ Waking up before the sun comes out to a road trip or going to the airport.

â€¢ The corridors of an hotel and coming in an hotel for the first time.

â€¢ Staying in your classroom because thereâ€™s an storm outside.

â€¢ Being at the pool around 6-7pm where the sun is already going out.

â€¢ Food buffets, either in hotels or locals.

â€¢ Going to buy notebooks for school.

â€¢ Staying up late 10pm~11pm ish playing with your console on a late summer night.

â€¢ Waking up early before anyone else and preparing yourself some cereal for breakfast.

â€¢ Saturday mornings watching cartoons.

I guess most of these are â€˜Americanâ€™ and so on since I tried to remember back to when I used to visit, anyhow love trips down memory lane.
