Business idea. Be a paparazzi agency that famous people can hire to follow around other paparazzi who piss them off. Then print a magazine where the other paparazzi are talked about as if they are famous, like "so and so ate a bagel today" just so actors/singers can show others what it's like to not have any privacy.
