My college is opening soon. It was a fun time around here. After a long break for 5 months, finally my med
school is opening. These holidays would be
missed. I am already missing my time on Reddit
because its gonna get real busy after they open
up the tests, terms, assignments everything's gonna pile up. But would see ya guys
around the weekends if i didn't slack off tye working days ;(.
