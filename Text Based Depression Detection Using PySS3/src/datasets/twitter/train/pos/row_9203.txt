I think I hit a ghost deer So I'm driving to my dad's house at about 6am this morning and im on this older road that goes into the county my dad lives in. I've driven on this road with my mom (I'm on a driver's permit) many times and I would say I'm decent at driving for my age because I drove illegally since I was 13. I'm driving on this road, which is parallel to a deer infested forest and a deer jumped out in front of me and I knew I was going to hit it but I braked anyway. I felt it hit the car and I'm surprised the airbags didnt go off, and my mom and sister who were both in the car also felt me hit it. We pulled over to assess the damage and there was nothing, no scratches, no dents, nothing. and deers will mess up your car right? I was driving a 4 ton Volvo but still there would be damage right? We looked for the deer but we also couldn't find it. there was no blood or guts or anything either. We looked in the ditches and my mom got a gun incase we need to put it out of its misery but  there was nothing there. Is there an explanation for this? I know there are people here that are smarter than me and I would like to hear some sort of explanation because personally, I dont want to think it was a ghost deer or something.
