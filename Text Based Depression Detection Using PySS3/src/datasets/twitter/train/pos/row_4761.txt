I felt mocked today by some classmates and idk what to do/what they meant We had a free period and the topic of relationships came up, I said I had one (very short term) and that's about it, and honestly, I've never seen so many shocked faces at the same time. And some straight up started saying "YOU?????" Like... I know I'm not conventionally attractive but that's just unwarranted. And that's exactly what I told them, in which I got the response "it's not that, it's just that you're... Well... You know..." like?????? Boi I obviously don't?! What do you mean?! I never got a straight response ffs this is so annoying
