I need help. So I'm 15 Yrs old and I'm planning on confessing to a girl very soon that I like her, this is my ultimate crush so I need to nail this confession, the paragraph I've currently got is below and some suggestions on any changes or additions will be very much appreciated.

Hey (censored), Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for a while and I know your probably sleeping right now, but Iâ€™m not and I canâ€™t seem to fall asleep with you on my mind, I think itâ€™s time I tell you. I really like you, and I thought you should know. I understand if you donâ€™t feel the same way about me and I still wanna be friends because I really enjoy just being around you. And itâ€™s not just your really beautiful eyes or your amazing hair but itâ€™s also your personality that I really admire, just being around you itâ€™s immediately noticeable. From being placed in the same class as you and then being sat next to you in our random seating swap every week in English and HASS, it was a dream come true for me to now hanging out some weekends Iâ€™m actually so overly happy I get to have the experience to do that. Todays one of the most special days for me as I believe I'm speaking my heart out and release all this built-up pressure, believe me it took quite alot of courage doing this, I'm sorry for not telling you this in-person but whilst it may make me uncomfortable it may also make you uncomfortable, being that you may feel you have to make a decision then and there. That is why I am messaging you this so you have time to think this over. Yes, I would appreciate it if you keep this information to yourself as I don't want my private feelings to be at the centre of attention or of the laughing matter. I donâ€™t want to let this ruin our friendship, and I understand if you need some space for a while. Just know that whatever you decide I will fully understand and wonâ€™t take personally. Youâ€™re a really great person and deserve to fully choose without feeling uncomfortable. Thanks
