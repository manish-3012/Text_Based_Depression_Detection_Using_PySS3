Time For Some Intimidating ðŸ™ƒ Gals, Dudes, NBs and everyone else on the spectrum

My best friend officially has her first boyfriend and I'll be meeting him in a few weeks. Unfortunately the dude goes to the one university(and high school) where I don't know people, so finding out if he has anything my friend should be made aware is turning out to be more difficult than I thought.

Anyways, I still want to put the fear of god(or well... me ) in him :)  Now I know some of you are gonna say, 'she's 18, if she gets hurt thats on her because she is an adult'. But I love her to bits and a little fear doesn't hurt anyone.

Any ideas how I can do that? Talking points, actions or anything to make sure he knows what he's getting into. 

Thanks!
