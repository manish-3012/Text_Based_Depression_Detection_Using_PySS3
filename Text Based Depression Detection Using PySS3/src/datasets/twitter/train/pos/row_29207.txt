Whats with all those girls that cut their bangs, have a chocket, wear thrasher shirts and striped sleeves called? I'm probs out of the loop. I think they are called egirls, former vsco girls mostly? There seems to be nothing but a sea of these people. They all listen to Lil peep and Billie eilish. I mean some of them are cool but it feels like I'm in a sea of clones.
