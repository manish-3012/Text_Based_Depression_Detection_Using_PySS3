A kid I was kind of friends with died yesterday  We weren't super close, and I hadn't seem him in over a year, but it doesn't feel right, he's the first person under 50 that I've personally known who has died, and shits sad. He was shot while selling shoes to raise money so he could go to college or something. I hope the POS who did it goes to jail and gets ass raped people are so fucked up. Anyway nobody has to reply or anything, I just felt like writing this down and all
