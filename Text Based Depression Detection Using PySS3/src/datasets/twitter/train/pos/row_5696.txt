I have a question please answer So I was wondering what this would be called, basically I was at football practice right and my head started to feel heavy, like I couldn't keep my head up. Then i was kinda dizzy, and then I was struggling to balance and not fall and everything got extremely bright and very blurry, for example, like i was seeing everything in 144p. And what would happen was this blurry vision would pulsate sort of, like it would go and i could feel it, and itd slowly stop and go again. This was months ago in 95 Fahrenheit weather, american football.
