I'm looking for a date idea I'm 17 my gf is 16 and I'm looking for a date idea. Neither of us have a whole lot of money cause we don't have jobs. I like to do almost anything so that's not a factor, but she likes art hiking movies and with covid I just can think of new date ideas. Could y'all help me out.
