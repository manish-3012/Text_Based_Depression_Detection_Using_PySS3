It's everyone's favorite time, sad boi hours That moment when reddit is just about the only thing you feel comfortable talking to besides 1 other person. I've been getting really sad lately, I feel like shit, and I don't know what I'm going to amount to in the near future. I never take initiative, I'm 16 (the legal age to be able to get your drivers license where I live) and I've only driven twice because it scares me. I'm just about the worst at existing and it kinda sucks. So yeah
