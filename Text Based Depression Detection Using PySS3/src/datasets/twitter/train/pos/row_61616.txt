How should i ask my parents if i could download and play games on pc? I'm a 14 year old male and i have never played any games that need downloading on any pc or laptop. I also never played on console and most of all, my parents don't let me play any videogames at home. I only play mobile games and i am tired of only being able to play my phone. I really wanna play some minecraft and rainbow 6 seige on the family laptop, but i am too scared to ask my parents if i can buy games and play on our laptop. How should i approach my parents on this matter? I really wanna play some hxpixel with my friends in this pandemic.
