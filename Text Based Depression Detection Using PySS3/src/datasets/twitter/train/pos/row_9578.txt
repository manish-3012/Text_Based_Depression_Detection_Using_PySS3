My school just did an Among Us livestream for pink shirt day... So during lunch the science teacher turned on this stream of the staff playing Among Us... it was the most poorly run thing Iâ€™ve ever seen and I got secondhand cringe after. Honestly though, I applaud the effort. But theyâ€™re a couple of months late to the Among Us party...

Because the code was on the screen, I managed to join and lasted 30 seconds before being kicked. My name was Stalin and I kept putting in the chat â€œthe CCCP did nothing wrong.â€ The entire school saw...

Pretty good day otherwise.
