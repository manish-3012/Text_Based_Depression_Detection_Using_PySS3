Is Adventure Bay an adult care center? SO I have a theory.
It started with a question: WHY do these grown adults constantly call a ten year old (who lives alone with a bunch of dogs) to solve their every problem?
BECAUSE Ryder is not a ten year old boy at all. He is a young orderly at an adult care center for differently abled adults with a team of THERAPY dogs and all the episodes of the show are the imagined adventures of one of the patients.
Chickaleta? A stuffed chicken the "Mayor" Goodway uses to excuse all of the things she messes up.
Alex? A duck. Mr. Porters grandson died and it drive him over the edge so now he imagines this duck is his grandson and talks to it.
Humdinger? Also a patient, but in the criminal ward so he escapes constantly to try and mess with the other residents. As the only resident in that part of the ward he has given himself the title of mayor. Cares for all the stray cats around the town as the dogs don't like him.
Alternative theory on Humdinger- he's from a similar facility for the criminally insane across the road and constantly escapes to come mess with his cousin Mayor Goodway. (Grandpa Grover is clearly a Humdinger ancestor....)
Katie? ALSO an orderly / employee of the center who helps care for the various animals.
Jake? A former pro who has a severe traumatic brain injury and needs round the clock care - also why he eventually gets his OWN therapy dog, Everest.
Captain Turbot? A sea captain who lost his crew in a storm. Wally was his best mate on the crew and wally is an imagined creature on the campus. Saying Wally isn't real will cause Captn Turbot to throw you in the water.
