I was complimented today for the first time We were in class and for the first time we had to turn our cameras on

And my friend texted me "You hair looks amazing, I adore it" and I fucking blushed on camera 

And then a guy in chat said "Oooooo [Name] you're so sexyyy" (this was a joke tho)

But I got complimented on my hair, which feels nice.

I will remember it for the next 10 or more years
