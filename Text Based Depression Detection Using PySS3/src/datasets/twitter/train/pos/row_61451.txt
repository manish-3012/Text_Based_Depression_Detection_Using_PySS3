should i drop my college class? highschool senior/grade 12 here. this is my first year taking a college class while still being in highschool. itâ€™s been a challenge for sure but also nice i guess. iâ€™m taking an english class, because i figured i need to know how to write papers before taking other classes which will require them... however, i already know how to write papers and weâ€™re not really learning how to write papers or much of anything. we do handouts and whatnot in class but itâ€™s mostly lectures and i feel like iâ€™m not taking in that much, or that itâ€™s not benefitting me as much as itâ€™s a problem for me. iâ€™ll admit that iâ€™m lazy, donâ€™t want to do the work, and have horrible procrastination, but like i said, i already have most of the stuff down and it feels more negative than positive.

another big reason i want to drop the class is because i donâ€™t want to go to college, so why am i â€œlearning how to write papers for other college classesâ€ if iâ€™m not even going to be taking them you know?

i feel like iâ€™m just being lazy and giving into it but i literally donâ€™t want to do the work and the other reasons iâ€™ve mentioned. my parents and teachers probably wonâ€™t like me deciding to withdraw but iâ€™m not sure yet. i also feel bad because i have these opportunities and am just wasting them, and also because some people are taking two classes and are actually good students... i know everyone has their own journey and i shouldnâ€™t compare myself but itâ€™s honestly embarrassing.
