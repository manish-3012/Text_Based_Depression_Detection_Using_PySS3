IG threatened to delete my account So today I shared a spicy meme(Mehmed: LOL, my son blew up better than yours; Mohhamad:* pic of an angry Arabian guy*) and the story got deleted and I got a black screen where Instagram told me they might delete my profile. Also, a few of my friends shared the same post and nothing happend to their story. I even shared mine in close friend, while they shared it as a standard story. The original post hasn't been deleted. Could it be that someone reported my story? What should I do?
