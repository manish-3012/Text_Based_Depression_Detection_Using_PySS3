So my best friend told me that she thought about killing herself Idek how to start this but I guess starting with our backstory:

So we met on social media more than a year ago and started texting a lot. Since we live like 10 hours apart we never met irl but I still would say she's my best friend. She told me about not wanting to live anymore a while ago (around November last year I'd say). She also told me that she had been self harming herself for a while now. Because of that I told her that she needs help and encouraged her to see a psychologist. She actually went to see a psychologist because of me but she told me that she doesn't like to talk to him and that it doesn't help her.

So that topic didn't come up for a while but two days ago she told me that she thought about killing herself and that she self harmed again. We had some realtalk and she seem to be okay...for now. I'm sure that topic will sadly come up again sometimes.

I just wanted to ask for some advice on how I can help her although I can't really meet her irl. Is there any way for me to really help/change her?

Thanks for reading all the way and thanks in advance for helping me
