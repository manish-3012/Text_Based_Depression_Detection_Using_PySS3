I fucking hate kids I was doing my weekly dose of sport (literally just walking a lot) and a kid started whispering about me, i didnt looked at him, just got closer. I heard him say i had woman hair (yes, im a boy) and thst i looked really stupid. This sounds really dumb but it hurt a lot since i feel confident with long hair. Its not even that long, the point is i want you guys to remind me that im not ugly please
