The site cleaner at my school This cleaner at my school will walk around the younger year's area with her mask under her nose and then come walk into the sixth form area, not sanitize her hands and continue to not wear her mask properly, recently year 10 got sent home because one person was tested positive for coronavirus and he had made contact with alot of his year so everyone in year 10 was sent home, this fucking bitch of a cleaner cleans the year 10/11/sixth form area and still wont wear her fucking mask properly or sanitize her fucking hands I'm livid I can't believe she still has a job its insanity. Thank you for reading my rant about the cleaner at my school. 

Just to be clear she walks around during the break and lunch time and will get way too close for comfort with us students.
I'm thinking about reporting her for staff misconduct as she is endangering the lives of us students especially me as I'm immunocompromised due to type 1 diabetes.
