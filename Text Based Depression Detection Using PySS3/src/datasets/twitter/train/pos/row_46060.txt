Computer and tech enthusiasts: what ideas might u have for projects involving a 2009 netbook So, the netbook in question is a Dell Latitude 2110. I've got it set to dual boot windows and linux mint so u can just choose which is to use and it has both. Usually use linux since it's faster tho. But it's still pretty slow and old and I was wondering what kind of projects or things I could do with it to get some use out of it so that it isnt wasting away doing nothing. I'm not super tech savvy so the project shouldn't be anything too complex but I'm willing to try and learn basic things so if it's something the average person can learn and do, go ahead and suggest it ig 

Be as creative as u want, what ideas do u have?
