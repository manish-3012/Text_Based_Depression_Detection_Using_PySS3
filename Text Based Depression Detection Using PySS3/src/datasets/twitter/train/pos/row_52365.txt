TW rant ( I want to kms Iâ€™m really just feeling down. well I mean more than down. but for the past year or two my depression has gotten so bad. 

Iâ€™ve also developed an eating disorder and anxiety and self esteem problems. Things are hard. Like going outside or talking is a struggle. 
anyways, schools coming up. the biggest time of the year where my depression and anxiety gets triggered. why? I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m a person who loves attention, not sure why). But sadly I never really got it. Unlike other girls in my grade, they did. I guess that really triggered me. And still does. I always feel like a lone wolf. Lol 
anyways rejection is a huge trigger for me. and has brought me to a very low sense of self esteem. most times I liked a guy Iâ€™d be rejected. (I wish that would change, I wanna be liked). Anyways, Iâ€™d always get rejected, and no guys really ever liked me. And when Iâ€™d try to talk to them. Theyâ€™d be rude.
But when the popular pretty girls would talk to them, they werenâ€™t rude. and the guys definitely wouldnâ€™t reject them. I always desired to be that popular girl, the kind that every guy loves. And every girl wants to be. and Iâ€™m not sure how to attain that. Iâ€™m really tired of being treated like trash
It just really upsets me that guys donâ€™t even wanna talk as being a friend unless you have something to offer. 
the popular girls in my school talk to so many guys. they have so many guy friends. But yet, when I try to make some they treat me like some trash 

anyways this was based on my previous school years, and Iâ€™m praying that this school year is different. Hopefully I will be mentally happier, physically happier, and finally be noticed.
