Question about when I move out. Im currently 14 and my parents are weird and im not here to get into that. I save a small portion of the money I make at a job I work (like 30 percent) for when I move out. Like a apartment and etc. Ive told my parents if they don't stop with there antics im gonna move out and never talk to them again when available. My mom says that thats illegal even if im 18 and to get married i have to have my parents there. They have to approve legally and shit. Im scared that this is true but dont believe it entirely.
