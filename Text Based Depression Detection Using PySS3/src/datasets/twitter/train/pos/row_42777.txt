ive made my "first"friend!!! rant/advice omg so i was on omegel and i met this kid so we started talking and we were so in sync with eachother. after talking for a bit we exchanged
d discords and continued talking everyday for a couple hours eachtime we talked. im starting to thibk of this kid as a friend and maybe a but more. our conversations r always funny and talking to him always seems so natural and i dont feel embarassed typing somthing i would normally find embarasing. this is like the o ly person i talk to besides my sister,mom,dad,and grandma because i dont have many friends. i just wanted to rant about it on here and maybe somone knows what i should do next? and also if u could tell me the difrence between a crush and a friend bc ive always had trouble finding rhe difrence. tysm Ily:Dâ¤â¤â¤â¤â¤
