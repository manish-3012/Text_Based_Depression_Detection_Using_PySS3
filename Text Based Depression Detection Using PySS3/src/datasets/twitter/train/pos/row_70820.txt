Every parent should be like my stepdad Parents should either beat or yell at their children when they're upset. Soft parents raise ignorant kids. Ignorance is bliss. Any parent that ISN'T trained to be a hardcore parental figure like my stepdad should be prosecuted for 10 years. People spreading diseases everywhere raising screwed-up-in-the-mind snowflakes is why we still have the pandemic. Assholes not wearing gloves to the SUPERMARKET or while throwing out the trash should have their hands stepped on by crocodiles!

I want to make ALL parents on this ðŸŒ to be strict/tough/great again. My stepdad is the best example of what a parent should be. Bring back the death penalty for misdemeanors and felonies. Any parent who doesn't raise their kids with manners should lose their parenting license and be on the watchlist for 50 years!!!

IGNORANCE/LAZINESS/WEAKNESS WILL NOT BE CURED UNLESS ALL JUNK FOOD AND CARB DRINKS ARE OUTLAWED FROM SALE TO MINORS
