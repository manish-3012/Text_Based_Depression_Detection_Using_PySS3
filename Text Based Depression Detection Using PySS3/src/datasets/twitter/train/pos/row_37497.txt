For anyone living in a dysfunctional family... You're not alone, I live in a family of 7, I'm one of 4 sons, and the youngest child, tied with my twin sister, I have seen, still and will see abuse, from my father to my mother, my brothers to my sister, and me against my brothers even, I can only hope to who or whatever is up there that this stops eventually, you know how when you're around someone you know well, you don't feel awkward sitting around them ? Well, that's been kind of fucked up for me and my family, everytime we sit with each other, someone says something stupid, without thought, or even just completely wrong, another one calls them out, an argument starts, then one raises their voice and calls the other names, a fight starts, everybody is left with a bad taste in their mouth, and this has happened countless times, and it never gets better, every damn time one of us is near the other, I just feel like my heart is going to explode from stress and anxiety, and while I won't say I got used to it, I'm starting to feel like I can handle it more and more as I grow up, because I have hope, happiness, love and determination, and one day, I will find true freedom and peace of mind, and I hope you turn out fine and find your purpose in life.
