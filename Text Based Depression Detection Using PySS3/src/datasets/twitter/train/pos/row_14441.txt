Males !!!âš ï¸ Iâ€™ve a question for yous!!! âš ï¸ Right so sis is in a pickle rn â˜¹ï¸

Basically I had a guy friend that I met online and I ended up liking him,  he liked me too but his feelings faded and when I told him I still liked him two and a half months ago we just didnâ€™t speak after that conversation...

...so my question is:

Would it be too weird to message him â€œhey we havenâ€™t spoken in a while, how are you?â€ ?
