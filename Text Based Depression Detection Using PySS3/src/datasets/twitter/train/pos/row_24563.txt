Parasitic-RA (PRA) - Report from Badua Oikaso PRA is a type of parasite that target any type of hostâ€™s, specifically humans

It was first located in Florida during 2031 in which it hijacked peopleâ€™s brains to perform acts of cannibalism on young humans, presumably those under the age of 11 due to it being a perfect food source for it to hijack the hostâ€™s mind

If left for around 13 days, itâ€™ll give them anxiety, teeth decay, or muteness

Once it finishes hijacking the host, itâ€™ll make the host play dead, this is so that crows, specifically the African Skybomber will eat the human, thus letting the PRA multiply by releasing the cells of the human into the crowâ€™s immune system, quickly confusing the crowâ€™s immune system due to the similarity, soon leading into the crowâ€™s cells attacking each other, soon leading into blood loss which the PRA dies expect the original
