So apparently iâ€™m not allowed to get crunchyroll to watch anime legally. But my parents are cool with me pirating it. (Not related to title) this rule of needing a minimum character count to post to stop spam is so fucking stupid before people would say random shit that popped into their head bow i need to meet a character count.  FUCKING BULLSHIT
