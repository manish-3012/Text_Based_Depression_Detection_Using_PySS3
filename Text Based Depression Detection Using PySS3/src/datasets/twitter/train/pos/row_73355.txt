Worried that I'm wasting my teenage years? I'm 15 and in Year 9. I haven't been to a party, I haven't had a girlfriend, I haven't had my first kiss etc.

I'm worried that I'm wasting my teenage years.

My goal this year was to get a girlfriend, which was hard enough because I've never had one and COVID made it even more impossible. 

There's hardly even a girl at my school that I like. There is either the popular girls who think they're celebrities and will leave me on delivered on snap or there's girls i'm not really into. I've never even had my first kiss.

I'm not super popular and I've never been to a party.

Over quarantine I've been working on myself by losing weight and working out and changing my hairstyle and things like that.

Getting a girlfriend is the one I want so badly. I wanna be like those relationship goals videos you see on TikTok. I want to cuddle up in bed and have someone that I love and who loves me back. I feel like if I don't get a girlfriend at all in high school then it's going to be a waste of time and that i'll be way behind and missed out on so many good opportunities that come with having a girlfriend in highschool.. You might say "oh you don't need a gf". Well you don't NEED anything except for food and water. But i really really want a special girl, a girl that I can have a REAL relationship with in highschool. I don't want to be some loser who doesn't get his first girlfriend till he's finished high school.

I really hope next year is the year where I can be more of a "proper" teen and go to parties, have a girlfriend and stuff like that.

Just wanted to vent
