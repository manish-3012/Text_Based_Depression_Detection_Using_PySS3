I did something bad like really bad Well so basically the other night I was outside drinking water and uhh well i started whistling (because that attracts skinwalkers and shit) and I screamed at the top of my lungs I'm so sorry but I screamed BITCH YOU DUMBASS SKINWALKER COME GET MY ASS...i dont know why I did it and now I'm really scared because that night I had heard noises coming from the left and right of my bed so I contacted my friend about it and she told me to draw a sigil on my hand and put a thing of water(it catches bad spirits)under my bed and go to sleep( all I had was a dasani water bottle) and I wake up I feel like I had a nightmare but I forgot what it was and I grabbed the water and put it in my bathroom(my stomach kept hurting really badly that day)and later that day when I get home from school I drank the dasani water I put under my bed....the one that probably captured a fucking demon or bad spirit so far all that has happened is I keep hearing weird noises outside I keep sweating and my friend (the one that told me to draw a sigil and stuff) texted me that someone might of broken into her house and I cant sleep oh and my stomachs hurting again like I'm going to throw up
