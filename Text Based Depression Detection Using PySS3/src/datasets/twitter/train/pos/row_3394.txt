I hate Animojiâ€™s they donâ€™t work for me They think my eyes are half way close yeah my eyes are small (not like an Asian) and they canâ€™t get it right, also it looked like Iâ€™m sad :( and my face is like :| my Animoji looks sad and high, they clearly only tested them on white people, when my black friend tried them it looked like his mouth was open even tho it was close and i donâ€™t have Asian friend but if I had to guess the eyes in he Animoji would be closed
