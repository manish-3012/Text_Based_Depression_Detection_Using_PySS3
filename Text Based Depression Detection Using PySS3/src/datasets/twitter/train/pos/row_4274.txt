Has anyone taken AP Art and would be willing to answer some questions? My school didnâ€™t allow me to take AP Art this year due to scheduling conflicts so Iâ€™ve decided to sign up for the exam myself and complete the portfolio without in-class assistance. Iâ€™ve figured out most of it but I still have a couple questions regarding concentration and the selected works. Is anyone currently taking AP Art or has already taken and would be willing to DM and answer a few questions for me? Thanks!
