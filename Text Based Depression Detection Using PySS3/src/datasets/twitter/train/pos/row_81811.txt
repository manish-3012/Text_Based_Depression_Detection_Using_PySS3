I need help on how to turn my life around. I feel like I am piling up missings and I just bombed a test because I was distracted on YouTube and couldnâ€™t finish it. I want a future in a professional sport but I just am not motivated I canâ€™t get myself to work out or do anything. I try my best in school but still canâ€™t do anything it just feels like I would rather just lay down and die. I never have time to hang out with friends outside of sports and school because this takes up all my time. I procrastinate so much. I need help with doing better in school, Getting motivated and becoming a better athlete, any social life tips or anything about living. I feel like Iâ€™m about to snap and I would like some help I want to turn my whole life in a 180 and get a fresh start and I need help on how to do that.
