GUESS WHO GOT 420 KARMA It was me all laughs funny number aside I am really happy because I joined reddit in June and I love the community and have never felt more social during lockdown. I donâ€™t feel that I have any mental health issues but sometimes I just feel sad or frustrated for no reason, so having reddit really made me feel better when I needed it the most.
