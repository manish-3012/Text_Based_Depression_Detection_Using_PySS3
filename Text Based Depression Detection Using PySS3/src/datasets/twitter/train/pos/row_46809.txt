I Fucked Up Um Y'all. I have a Friend. Whom I Know Personally from school and We're Good Friends. And we Have Some WhatsApp stickers. They are Usually Memes and Vulgar Cusres lol. I accidentally Chose a Wrong Sticker and He was Pissed af, and He even Blocked me.

I kinda have a Bad feeling about this. What should i do?
