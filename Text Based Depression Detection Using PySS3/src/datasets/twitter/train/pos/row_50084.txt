I'm shocked and quite apalled. I was feeling productive so I got my dog on a leash, grabbed my phone, and went on a walk. We went down the usual path and I was expecting the usual quiet chatter around the patios, birds chirping and leaves rustling, when I spotted an African man smoking next to his car. He seemed good natured and waved at me with a smile, so I returned the greeting and passed him, a few feet away when a policeman came out of nowhere and started talking to him heatedly. I recognized the policeman who patrols around the area, so I stopped, curious, and heard much of the conversation. The policeman was talking about how cigarettes were bad and that it was polluting the air, and snatched it out of the man's hand only to crush it beneath his boot. I was confused, as he had never objected with any other person smoking in this area. The man apologized and told the officer that he wouldn't ever smoke again in this area, but the policeman shook his head and *told him he needed to pay a fine.* At this point I wish I did something. Smoking is pretty common around this area and this man should not be fined for something everyone does. But I just gripped my dog's leash tighter, and I didn't do anything. 

The man apologized again and asked for a chance, saying that he had seen no warning of the "non-smoking area". The policeman started to threaten the man of arresting him and even tried to grab his wrists and pull hard so he was jerked forward. I'm shameful to say that at this point I just bowed my head and walked away quickly. 

I'm so disappointed at myself for not speaking out. I may have just misunderstood the situation or something but I highly doubt that. It's shocking to see, and I honestly don't know why he suddenly went up against cigarettes right when he allowed it before, but I think today was not a good day for the African American man I passed by.
