Alright lads. Going into my HL IB Chem finalâ€™s now!! Of course they happen at the worst of times, with me being kicked out of my dads house for something I didnâ€™t do and my friend getting Covid but boy howdy I just reviewed 8 hours of video lessons in under an hour by speeding them up and somehow understood all of it and have 2 cups of coffee and 3 ice tea in me so Iâ€™m wide awake.  These next 4 hours are going to be hell but itâ€™s Christmas break after that so thatâ€™s epic. Wish me luck
