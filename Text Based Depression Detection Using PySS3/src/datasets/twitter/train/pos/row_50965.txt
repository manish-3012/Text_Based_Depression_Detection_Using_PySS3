2 hours into babysitting my cousins they tell me my aunt might have corona sheâ€™s in the other room doing work and sheâ€™s come through 2 times already with no mask and not sanitizing after. iâ€™m not sure what to do because i donâ€™t know if i should quarantine. my mom knew that she could have it but apparently no one wanted to tell me beforehand. iâ€™m kind of frustrated because i canâ€™t go to practice today without worrying that iâ€™m going to infect someone. not sure what to do but i know that if i tell my mom that sheâ€™ll be angry with me.
