How to deal with breakup This isnâ€™t for me but for my best friend. Her bf broke up with her and I want advice on how to make her feel better. Iâ€™m not really sure how to help her since my options are limited and I canâ€™t even see her irl cause of quarantine. I just wanna let her know Iâ€™m there for her. But Iâ€™m not good with words and Iâ€™m not sure what to say exactly. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship so Iâ€™ve never been through a breakup. I donâ€™t have experience when it comes to relationship stuff. If anyone has been through a breakup or just has good advice in general, please comment. This is pretty urgent. I just found out now. I love her to death. I see her as my sister already. I know if I was going through the same thing, she would be there for me too. So help?
