How the hell do you look for colleges? I'm a junior this year and I'm starting to look for colleges. What am I supposed to do? We use naviance so I've been able to find a few colleges I like and save them on my account, but most of them I just find ugly and boring seeming. I can't go on tours bc of covid so I'm just looking at the websites. Do I give the colleges I'm interested in my contact info now or should I wait? Are there good websites for honest reviews of colleges?
