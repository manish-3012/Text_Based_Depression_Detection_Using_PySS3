Iâ€™m going to be mute Voluntarily mute that is.

I got in a fight at school yesterday and I got fucked up. And it all could have been avoided if i would have just shut my trap. So my solution is to become mute. No talking, no nothing. I already am a quite person but my mouth runs faster than my brain and I donâ€™t think about that I say. It only causes me trouble. I donâ€™t have any friends or anything of that sort so nobody would care. I can talk to my family and shit like that but only people that I trust, and I have some bad trust issues anyway. Iâ€™ll probably make everyoneâ€™s lives easier if I just shut up, everyone hates me to begin with. This is my proposal, and I see no problems with it so far. Thank you for reading, now leave

I will also carry a knife with me
