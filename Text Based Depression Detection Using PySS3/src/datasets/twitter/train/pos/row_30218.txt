did i do a bad or good? i wanna start by saying my A key is broken and doesnt recognise half the time. so excuses if i fuck up a word

so im a 15 year old guy, and one of my older friends introduced me to his friend, a girl that just turned 18.

so we started talking and we really hit it off, and then we started flirting, and im scared that our age difference will do more harm, and im scared people will think we're weird

did i do a good by perhaps getting a gf or bad because shes 3 years older?
