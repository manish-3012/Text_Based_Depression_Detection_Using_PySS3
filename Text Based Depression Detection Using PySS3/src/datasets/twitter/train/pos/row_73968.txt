Hey guys what car do you think I should get? My dad's Golf R, the most powerful, the newest ,the fastest, and has AWD

An '88 pontiac fiero GT with a swapped engine to put out a little more power

Or late 60s early 70s mustang or camaro

They're all really cool cars but for very different reasons

Also my parents (or at least my dad) are onboard with all of the options
