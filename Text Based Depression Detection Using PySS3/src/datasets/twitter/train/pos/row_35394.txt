I have the worst class (school maybe) possible When I started going to the secondary school I didn't know anyone in my class (there's 10 of us). We rarely talk; there's 1 friend with whom I hang out every week (let's call him K). Besides, other kids (younger or older) who go to a different program hate me since I belong to a minority. Lately, I've heard from K that some of them (whole class except K) didn't invite me to the birthday party/parties, to be worse than this I was the only one who was not invited. They never call me to hang out with them, they will never help my with homework etc. What's the biggest problem is they are all very fickle. They won't curse me, tease me to a big extent, but some of them called me psychopath - that alone sums up their nature. They are all a bunch of cowards, they wont say anything directly to my face, they will try to be nice. Also, with whom I've spoken about this they'd all say just don't look at them, pretend that u don't see them bla, bla, bla. I'd do that, yet it's really hard to do that especially when we see 5 times a week for a whole year.  

TL;DR: My classmates are the most toxic people I've ever seen in my whole life and I despise them.
