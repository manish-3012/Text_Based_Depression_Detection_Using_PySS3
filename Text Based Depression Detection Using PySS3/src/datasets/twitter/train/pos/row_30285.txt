Can someone please suggest me a hobby? Iâ€™ve found myself getting irritated and angry over the last few weeks due to my boredom, and even though where I live in Australia went out of lockdown 3 months ago I havenâ€™t gone back to sport because truthfully my heart just wasnâ€™t in it, but Iâ€™m going mad and I need something to do with my life. Please help
