I lost a bet to my friend and now my school reputation is down the drain, nyah. https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/m0t8k6/beat_my_record_on_chihuahua_spin_i_dare_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf. Nyah

Is the source of how the bet started and the punish of the bet was to wear cat ears to school and say â€˜nyahâ€™ and â€˜uwuâ€™ after every sentence for a day, uwu. Iâ€™m planning on trying not to speak but if a teacher calls on me and I canâ€™t just not answer, nyah. So what do I do to save myself from this eternal pain and suffering? uwu.
