I think I friend-zoned myself with every girl Ik So yeah... I really want a gf and would be happy to have a majority of girls at my school as my gf (itâ€™s really small so Iâ€™m only talking about like 6 or 7 out of 20 girls in my grade). But the girls in my grade are in two clicks and Iâ€™m good friends with both clicks. I went for a girl openly in both clicks (Iâ€™m a junior rn and the first one was early freshman year and the second one was late last year) but got rejected by both. My strat was to be good friends with them for a bit just to connect and then ask them out but it didnâ€™t work. I took wayyy more time with the second girl bc I went after the first one after like 3 weeks bc I was super confident she was into me but ig I was wrong. Anyway Idk y I get rejected all the time but I read a post about dating advice and now I think I kinda screwed myself by being good friends will all the girls to see who I liked. Now that Iâ€™m close with all of them I think they will just see my as â€œone of those guysâ€ (who is basically one of the girls but a guy) which sucks bc Iâ€™m a guy. I like girls and I want a gf to hang out with and ... other stuff teenagers do, but I feel like it isnâ€™t going to happen now. Any guys who got gfs or girls who have advice feel free to drop it down below.
