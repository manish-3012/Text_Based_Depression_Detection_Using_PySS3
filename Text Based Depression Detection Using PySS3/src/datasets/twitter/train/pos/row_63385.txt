Is this a good idea? Iâ€™ve liked this girl since last year and didnâ€™t get to talk to her at all after COVID hit, and I finally got her snap, which I was elated about. Unfortunately though, she hasnâ€™t added me back yet. Itâ€™s been a while. So I was thinking about telling one of her best friends (and my acquaintance) my situation so that she could help. Any suggestions?
