Hey kiddos Hi. Iâ€™m almost 30 but I just wanna say the person you are as a teenager is really different from the person you are just 10 years later. Iâ€™ve learned and experienced so much that has opened my eyes. So I encourage everyone to always be open to new experiences and perspectives. There is so much possible that comes as a result of that. That is all. Goodnight
