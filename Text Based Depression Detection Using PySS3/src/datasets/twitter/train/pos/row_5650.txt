Is it bad to date someone right out of a relationship 17 y/o guy, this girl (16) ive known for like a year just got out of a year and a half long realtionship. We just started seeing eachother a few days after they broke up, and she still wants to be good friends with him. My question is it morally wrong because im also friends with her ex too
