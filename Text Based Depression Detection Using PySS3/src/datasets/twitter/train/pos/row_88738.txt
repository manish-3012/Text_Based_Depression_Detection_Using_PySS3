How do you guys deal with excessive daydreaming? I woke up today with the intention of working on an assignment but ended up wasting my morning by daydreaming a whole frickin novel starring myself. I looked it up and google said it might be me trying to run away from unpleasant realities, which might be true, the escape is fun coming back isn't and idk how to avoid it or if I even should - is there a way to time the daydreams?
