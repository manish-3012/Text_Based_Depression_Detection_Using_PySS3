Hey there, I need to share something with u guys I feel like I'm in a middle of an existential crisis I guess, may be vulnerable to depression bcoz my entrance exam is approaching &amp; I feel quite afraid to do this time, I mean I can't stop procrastinating about my past failures, &amp; it seems like my parents don't really acknowledge my small successes. Some of my teachers have been really mean to me &amp; predict that I might just fail in it. Things have been a bit tough for me for the past 2 years not able to perform according to my parent's expectations but I think talking to a community of similar age group might lighten up my heavy heart &amp; give me a head start towards my destination.

Anyways,

This community has encouraged me to get up from a downfall.

Thank u guyz.
