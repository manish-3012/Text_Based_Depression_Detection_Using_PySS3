This is an appreciation post for the guy i just told you, u/ParkerDap 

ParkerDap is a really, really great person. 'But why? Why is he so great that you made an entire post based on this random person?' you may ask well, listen here guys. ParkerDap is probably the most coolest, raddest person i've ever met on this platform he is super chill, he is very funny, extremely smart, cool, and everything good mixed in one. 

ParkerDap also has a very cool music choices, not only that, he even made a compilation of lyrics/lines of his favourite song you should check it on his account/profile. 

ParkerDap is also very polite. He is careful of his choice of words. Hes a role model dare i say, i mean look at him he got the look, brain, and attitude. Please give him an applause guys. The thing that never cease to amaze me is how patient he is towards me. For the most of our time talking, i rarely replied on time because of the timezone and all but, to this day, ParkerDap still talks to me and is very supportive. Usually, some people wouldnt even care to continue the conversation at all, but he, the og homie ParkerDap, he manages to bear it. Again, give him an applaud please. 

Anyways, what im saying is that, u/ParkerDap deserves some applause and love man... He is super uber duper mega turbo rad. Ilysm homie god bless you, long live the king ParkerDap :]
