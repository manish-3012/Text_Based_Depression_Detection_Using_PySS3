New to the USA, any tips for making friends (boo covid) Just moved here a few weeks ago, school started and all, but people don't seem too sociable or approachable from online classes. Should I just start asking them for their discords and try to get into games with them ( I'll be finalizing my computer build soon). I still have a lot of friends from back home to whom I talk a lot, but the 7 hour difference is kinda weird.

I'm a sophomore btw.
