I love little kids (not in bad way lol) I don't rly understand ppl hating them. 

Whatever they do they are sooo cute. I even love babies crying in movie theaters. They are so cute (obviously, smiling babies are cuter but I never find them annoying or loud)

I love little kids, I love looking litrle kids running around, I like seeinf them smile. 

But im just 16 and have never took care of a little kid myself so idk but so far I love little kids

This sounds like pedophile but trust me its not that.
