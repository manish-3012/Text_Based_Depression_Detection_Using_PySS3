My realistic teacher Basically, he teaches modern u.s. history. On the first day, he told us this: math and history are alike. You're never gonna use it past the basic stuff, but history wont lie to you. He explained that no. You're never realistically gonna use this. But, they are stories. Just like the ones you and I are experiencing right now, and that makes them cool. Also, he said that if you just do your in-class work, you wont have homework. It honestly blew me away with his honesty. He also talked about the true part of working, they are looking for people who can work with anyone, talk with anyone, are creative and problem solvers. Which by the way, schools crush creativity out of students. Some teachers get mad if you dont solve things their way. BAD. But no. He says that so long as the problem is solved without creating another, thats good.
