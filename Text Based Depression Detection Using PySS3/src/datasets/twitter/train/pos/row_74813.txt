Feeling high, but Iâ€™m just sleep deprived. I didnâ€™t sleep last night, and now I feel high or something. Itâ€™s all spinning, but not really. I feel like my eyes are wobbly haha. Tip: donâ€™t play CS:GO if you havenâ€™t slept, youâ€™ll end up staring up into the sky (in CS). I kinda wanna get high for real, and not just get the sleep deprivation high. Cuz I like this feeling, and I feel like weed or shrooms would be even better. But of course drugzz arenâ€™t legal where I live :( and Iâ€™m only 15, and theyâ€™re â€œbadâ€.
