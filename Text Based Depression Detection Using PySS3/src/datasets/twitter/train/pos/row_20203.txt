Getting a little disappointed with the new AOT season Something about it is making disapointed cause there will only be 10 more episodes. I know its a lot but I feel like a lot more could have happened in the first six. pretty much all new characters are forgettable and uno (I think thats his name) and zofia were literally only in the series to die. I dunno, itll probably be better further on
