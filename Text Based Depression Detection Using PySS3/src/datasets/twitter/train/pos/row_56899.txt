Pls never flush a full toilet Itâ€™s 5am and I had to pee super bad so I went to the bathroom and for context, my brother had already peed and pooped in the toilet but it seemed like it didnâ€™t flush well. So I peed on top of it and flushed and as a result, the toilet water rose all the way up to the top. Obviously I tried using the plunger but that did nothing and for some reason I thought that it would work if I flushed it again. Deadass such a big mistake bc the fucking water just spilled over the toilet and I ended up having to clean a mixture of my brother and iâ€™s pee at 5am in the morning. Sorry for the tmi I just had to let it out
