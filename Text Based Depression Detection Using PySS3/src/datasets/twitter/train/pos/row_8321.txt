â€œYou can listen to music, I donâ€™t have a problem with that! Go right ahead, I just need you to be able to hear meâ€ - My teacher And no, heâ€™s no talking about hearing him when he gives lessons, heâ€™s talking about when we have work periods :|

This makes no sense, teacher, I cannot hear you when I have music in my ears. And if I could hear you, there would be no point of listening to music.
