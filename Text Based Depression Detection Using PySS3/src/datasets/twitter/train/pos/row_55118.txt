So i did a thing so on Saturday, i was bored as hell and making random conversation on the group chat as you do. Then one of the boys on the chat sent some star wars meme after i failed to speak english and weather he realised or not he called me intelligent, me being me said thanks for calling me intelligent... he responded with sure and nothing had been said on the group chat. thing is and i dont know if this is just me, it sounds a bit like he was shit didnt mean do that..... his girlfriend is also on this chat and im a single girl. whoops have a good day (this is a random anecdote that no one needed to hear about my life have a good day)
