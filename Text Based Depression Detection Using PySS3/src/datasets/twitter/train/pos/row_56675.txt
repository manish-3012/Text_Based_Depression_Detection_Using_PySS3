you guys are talking about crushes but I guess I just found a new friend i met her in a groupchat my other friend made, and it just feels like we can read each other's minds and it's so cool I've never thought I'd meet a person like this. I know friends are not always supposed to have the exact same personality as you, but this time we're really really similar. she laughs at my jokes in caps and our other friend talks about how we should get married and I'm so happy I have a new friend lol feels nice
