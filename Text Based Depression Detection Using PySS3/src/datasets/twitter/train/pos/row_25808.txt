Probably the easiest way to make new friends. Message me if you want an invite to an active teen discord server where I made most of my friends. We have a decent amount of active members, server events including art and stuff but you donâ€™t need to take part, we have fairly active voice chats and itâ€™s open for anyone of any sex/gender/frying pan to join as long as youâ€™re a teenager.
