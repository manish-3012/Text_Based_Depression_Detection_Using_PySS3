[Water is not wet. Water makes things wet. To say that water is wet is to then deem all things wet because of the possibility of things being wet, therefore deeming the usage of the word wet useless. The statement \\"water is wet\\" must be referring to it as a constant state, otherwise the premise itself is redundant. Therefore, to say water is wet, you would need sufficient logic proving water can never not be wet. If wet is defined by coming in direct contact with water, than there must logically be a minimum amount of water that can be considered water without being in contact with water. It would be impossible for the minimum amount of water to also be in contact with said minimum amount of water.](https://preview.redd.it/p2f1ybo0bss51.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0d5ee7097eb4cdba4b1aac6950575c42d05eac7)
