Im really glad me and my friend are still fine Cause she figured out I liked her last week and we never really talked about it and then I had to get my friend to talk to her and she said that she was uncomfortable and so i was worried it would be weird between the two of us. But no, I've had 2 school days since with her for 3 classes each and it's all fine, we're cool. I'm just happy about it
