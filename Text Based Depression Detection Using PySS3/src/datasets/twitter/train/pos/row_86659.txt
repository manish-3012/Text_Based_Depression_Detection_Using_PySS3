Relationships With Parents Iâ€™m not too sure about you guys but for me, I donâ€™t feel very comfortable talking to my parents about everything (being an open book) and I have donâ€™t even feel like talking about my hobbies or going on walks with them.

To the teens of reddit who are open with the parents, how do you manage to do it? Itâ€™s not like I feel insecure or anything, it just feels weird.
