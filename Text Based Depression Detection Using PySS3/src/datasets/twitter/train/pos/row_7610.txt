i can bet none of you had as many near death experiences in your lives, anyways lets see who does, shall we? ok so...

when i was 2 isreal invaded my country and did air raids about a mile away from my house at the time, a bomb once dropped on the building that was like right next to us, and shock wave broke our windows, i was 2 and i dint die obviously.

after that i moved to Canada for a few years, moved back in 2018, to Lebanon, AH the feeling of peace, thankfully i'm moving back in summer 2021.

either way, after that September 2019, wildfires erupted in the south of lebanon, my home town isin the south and we were there for a visit, out house burned down, but thankfully we werent home because the fires were happening.

now october 2019, i was going with my dad to downtown beirut, and little did we know, people were just shooting everywhere over there protesting the government, my grandma called us telling us to go home, we were like 200m away from downtown, so we sped back home.

now comes a few months of relative peace, a few shots fired here and there, but we got used to that.

and then there was august fourth, the infamous beirut blast, the windows in my roon SHATTERED BIG TIME one hit me, i got a huge cut on my leg, after that i went to the hospital i was fine.

now comes 5 days ago, in the same location of the beirut explosion, a fire happens, in a warehouse allegedly storring oil and some explosives, i was very near then, but i ran back home before anything really bad happened. 

so who has almost died more than me?
