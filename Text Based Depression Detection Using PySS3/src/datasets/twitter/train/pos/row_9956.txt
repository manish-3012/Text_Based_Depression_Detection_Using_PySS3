Day 30 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. â™ƒ: What do you think I'm mad about? 

â™€: You're not mad.

â™ƒ: What am I then?

â™€: I don't know...

â™ƒ: You're lying.

â™€: I thought you said you were getting annoyed because I kept talking about it?

â™ƒ: Ahaha. That's so right.

â™ƒ: What about you, then?

â™€: I'm mad about a lot of things I guess.

â™ƒ: Liar.

â™ƒ: You're not mad.

â™ƒ: You're jealous.

â™ƒ: Why are you so jealous.

â™ƒ: It's flattering. But it's weird.

â™€: I don't know.

â™ƒ: We're so mean though. We're mean to YOU.

â™€: You aren't at all. And Neptune isn't...

â™ƒ: I wish I could be meaner. I wish I could be so much meaner.

â™€: When you are mean though, it doesn't feel mean.

â™€: Like you said, we're friends, right?

â™ƒ: Yeah.

â™ƒ: You know, you could be a LITTLE mean, and we wouldn't care.

â™€: I don't want to, though.

â™ƒ: Sometimes you're still mean, without meaning to be.

â™€: I know. I hate it.

â™€: I'd rather get made fun of than be mean.

â™ƒ: Hmm.

â™ƒ: You shouldn't say things like that.

â™€: Why not? I don't want to. I just don't.

â™€: I know I'm bad at getting anyone to like me and I'm weird and everyone else can deal even though I can't, but I can't.

â™€: I'm just going to be like this. I'm not going to be any different.

â™ƒ: You're asking to get beat up.

â™€: I don't care.

â™ƒ: But for real.

â™€: I said I'm fine.

â™ƒ: You're frustrating.
