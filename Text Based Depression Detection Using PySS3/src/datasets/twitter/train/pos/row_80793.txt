What do you think of Scars? What do you think of scars? My friends think they are disgusting but my girlfriend thinks they are cool. However I think my girlfriend is biased. I have a massive scar on my arm and another even bigger scar on my back then just goes from the right to left and is about and inch wide. Iâ€™m curious if you guys think they are weird or scary or idk? I am of the mindset that scars tell a story and doesnâ€™t mean anything bad or good.
