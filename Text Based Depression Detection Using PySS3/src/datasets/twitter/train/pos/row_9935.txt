Need some help with buying glasses I need help buying glasses. I don't really have a problem with my vision per say, I used to wear glasses. I am buying them more for fashion. On this site where they are cheapest, it says I can buy frame only. Does it really mean JUST the frame? or will it come with some kind of glass in it?

Also I'm asking here bc askreddit is a pile of poop when it comes to me posting on there
