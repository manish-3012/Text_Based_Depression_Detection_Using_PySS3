Iâ€™m crying and it feels good Not because Iâ€™m sad or depressed. Iâ€™m crying because  tomorrow Iâ€™m heading back to college and it made me realize something. 

Just how much fun Iâ€™ve had this summer. Between my family all being together, spending summer nights and weekends with my step sister as we bonded more than ever before, and realizing just how fast time passed by this year. 

There is so much more context and details and things we did but I donâ€™t want to bore you. 

And now here I am... tomorrow morning taking the bus back off to college in NYC while my family went back to their states, my step sister going back to her dads until December, and knowing how much I appreciate everyone in my life.
