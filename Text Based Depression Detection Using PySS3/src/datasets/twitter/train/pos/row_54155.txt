Tik Tok: Is it really that big? In recent news, the US banned Tik Tok (for an explanation on the ban: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFkR1CitWM0)). It seems as though regardless of the potential security concerns, teens are still using it. I have a few questions as a whole:

Do you still use it? 

Has Instagram Reels taken you or your peers from Tik Tok? 

What would have to happen/come out for you to delete Tik Tok?

I know that when I was a teenager, I also would have told the government to stick it too.  Is it just the absence of another app like it?
