Need help with French homework! Hi, if you are French/understand it then could you please help me? 

IÂ´ve got a map of the metro system in Paris and we have to find where we start and finnish. 

The thing is I have to listen to audio in French and I don't understand a thing (except for trois, that's the only thing I figured out.

If you can and want to help, then I would appreciate it very much ( and my friend, we're really bad at French)

DM me if you can help. 

Thanks!
