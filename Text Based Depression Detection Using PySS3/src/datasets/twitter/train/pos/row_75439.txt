i have a frog dissection today. if you had seen my post on friday abt it, you would know, iâ€™m not excited. Basically, we had to watch a preview of it and i ended up crying &amp; passing out. i am really sensitive with animals and everyone knows that. iâ€™ve asked if i can just not do it, for my safety, but she said no. what i feel is going to happen is, iâ€™m going to cry, feel lightheaded, panic attack, pass out. panic attacks happen often to me so i wouldnâ€™t be surprised. iâ€™m really scared.
