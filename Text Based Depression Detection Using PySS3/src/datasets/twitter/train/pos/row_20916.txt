when you have a fat crush on your best friend but you guys are the closest people ever and reddit is the one social media site that she's not on and you say 'i love you' to each other like every hour and it's driving you crazy because you're SO GONE for her and you can't even rant about it on tumblr/twitter/insta because SHE'S ON THERE and she probably wouldn't think it would be about her because her self-doubt is crippling and for once in your life you're grateful for her naivety because you're sure it's so obvious since you've been obsessed with her for ages now.  that's it, no advice needed, i'm just filled to the brim with how much i care about her.
