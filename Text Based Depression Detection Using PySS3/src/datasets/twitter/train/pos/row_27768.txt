Shit day I had 3 tests and they were all fucking solid and when I got home my I found out my mam got scammed for a load of money and if the bank doesn't do anything about it I'm not really going to have a Christmas so fuckinhell, all I wanted to do was go to football training today as well but I couldn't cos my mam was on the phone all day.
