hereâ€™s the plan for my life alright so Iâ€™m going to try and get into the medical field. do something with cancer research or go into nursing but thereâ€™s to many opportunities so I could end up doing something different. then hopefully the job pays decent and I can go into retirement. maybe if Iâ€™m in good health open up a cute pumpkin patch and have a Australian Shepard as a farm dog. if that doesnâ€™t happen then I wanna open a skate shop because theyâ€™re arenâ€™t any in my area. and then whatever happens in between then might adopt two kids or something. probably a husband in there too. idk whatâ€™s your dream life plans?
