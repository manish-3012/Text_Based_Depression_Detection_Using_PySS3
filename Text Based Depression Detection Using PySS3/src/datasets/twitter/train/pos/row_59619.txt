Am I sexist for being scared of women? Okay it's not like a phobia or anything, but I'm a little scared of people and in general more scared of women. I've been bullied by both genders, here's some experiences: the boys who bullied me hit me. It wasn't rare for them to make me bleed and they made me bleed since kindergarten. But I was manipulated, betrayed, used, ect. by women. Of course I understand not all women are like that, but I'm more scared of getting bullied by women. I can fight back if hit but women are more likely to be passive aggressive. Of course, I know that not all women and not all men are like this. But in general if a woman was bad she'd be more likely to insult you and a man would be more likely to hit you, and I'd rather be hit to be honest because I see pain as a learning experience (I do not see others pain as a learning experience and I do not think it's okay when they're bullied.) and it hurts a lot more when my self esteem gets ruined. I myself am non binary (Assigned female at birth), and I do not think women are all bad or men are all bad. But as I'm more afraid of people in general, I'm scared of getting bullied again and more scared of getting bullied by women (I'm not saying women are more likely to be bullies.) I don't think all women are bad or all men are bad, but I would rather be bullied by the average man then the average woman. Does this make me sexist?
