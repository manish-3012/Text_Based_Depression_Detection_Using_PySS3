My depression has gotten way better over this last year. And Reddit has helped me loads! Please take time out of your day to read my story! Thank youâ¤ï¸ Iâ€™m happy to say that after using this app for 1 year today, my life has changed. Iâ€™ve made really good friends whom I cherish and love. Iâ€™ve been welcomed into communityâ€™s and felt part of something. And also been given direct content consumption that is hard to find anywhere else, taking my mind of some of my real life traumas. During this past year Reddit has helped me find out about myself, ask for advice on certain things - which led me to speaking to a doctor and now I take anti depressants which has helped my depression so much. I was in such a dark spot a year ago today, and Reddit has helped me out of that hole. If your suffering. Things get better. My DMs are open if anyone wants to talk or just need a friend. Hereâ€™s to many more Years on Reddit!
