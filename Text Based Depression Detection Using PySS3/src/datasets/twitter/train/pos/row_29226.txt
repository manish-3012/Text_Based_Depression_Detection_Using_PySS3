I think that people are too sensitive I just feel that people of my generation are way more sensitive then older people, like i could make a joke and that person who i told the joke to could end up hating me for a lonh peiod of time, and if i told that joke to a older person ( say like 18 or older ) they can just laugh it off or just ignore it. Also ive noticed some kids my age or older are making desitions that they shouldent really be worrying about until their older and they get criticized for it and get angrey or sad about it.

And look i know if someone is in a bad position at that time lets say their perants got divorced or a close relative passed, i get it their going to be more sensitive to jokes over a certin time. But if their not going through a ruff patch and just living happily i think they should be able to handle criticism 

I understand if you dissagree with me and my opions
