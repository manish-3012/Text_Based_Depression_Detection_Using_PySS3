Any ideas as to which laptop I should get I want a laptop at Christmas, and I'm not sure of my budget, but I want one I can game on, and one I can do schoolwork on. Is there any laptops that meet my requirements or do I have to go for one or the other? Honestly I'm not going to play many games, just probably fortnite and minecraft. Maybe some among us, so any ideas?
