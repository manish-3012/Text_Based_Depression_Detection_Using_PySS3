I've won two awards with this joke, I hope you like it Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson decide to go on a camping trip. After dinner and a bottle of wine, they lay down for the night, and go to sleep.

Some hours later, Holmes awoke and nudged his faithful friend.

"Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."

Watson replied, "I see millions of stars."

"What does that tell you?"

Watson pondered for a minute.

"Astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets."  
"Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo."  
"Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three."  
"Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are small and insignificant."  
"Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow."  
"What does it tell you, Holmes?"

Holmes was silent for a minute, then spoke: "Watson, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!"
