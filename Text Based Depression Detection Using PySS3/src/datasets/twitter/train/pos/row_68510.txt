Well. (Add on to last post) I already posted my speil for the day about how I feel. I did that an hour and a half ago. And I was feeling really good. Now my mind is starting to run and I can feel my energy picking up. I have the sudden need to contact one of my "therapy" buddies but I know they are both asleep. Im scared. I dont like this part of me. Im breathing really heavily and I keep looking around. Someone just tell me to stop.
