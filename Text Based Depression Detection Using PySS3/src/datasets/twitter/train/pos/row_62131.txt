DAE get really depressed looking for products to help you look better? like im looking for some skincare products and its so complicated to me. i understand it but my brain doesn't even want to go through the trouble of doing any of it, and it doesn't help that there 5 family members in the house and we have 1 bathroom. i just get really depressed to really groom myself, i dont the basic stuff: showering, brushing teeth, shaving but i have no desire to do skincare. it's really just my chin that has pimples and it makes me insecure cause i dont want to do anything about it. and a other problem is my super straight pin hair, i currently have no hairstyle n and just leave it as is. it is a pain to deal with and i dont feel like buying special products... i guess i just hate being me.
