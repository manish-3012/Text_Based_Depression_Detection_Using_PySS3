Is it weird to ask for a girls Snapchat over Instagram DMâ€™s I follow this girl who goes to another school and we are in the same grade but I have never talked to her before. Would it be weird to ask her straight up for her Snapchat or should I try to start a convo up over Insta then lead into it? Also is it a waste of time to try and get involved with liking someone rn because of COVID?
