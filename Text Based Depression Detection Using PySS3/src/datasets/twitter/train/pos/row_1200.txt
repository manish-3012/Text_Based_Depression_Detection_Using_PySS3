My fish died. Draco (a betta fish) lived with us for almost 2 years and lived for a total of almost three. He never liked to play with toys like most betta fish, he only liked other fish, we had him alone for a long time, and then we got him snails. He seemed to swim more and play more after the snails moved in, then after the snails died he lived alone for about half a year until last month when we got a catfish. He seemed to get along with the catfish but it wasnâ€™t until the catfish died and we got 2 frogs, 5 shrimp, and a platy, that he really started to be truly happy again. He would swim and play with the frogs, and even move aside to let them eat food. He was also friends with the platy, they would sleep on a leaf hammock together. Upon finding Draco dead this morning we saw that the frogs were swimming near him and looking at him trying to play with him. RIP little buddy. You will be missed.
