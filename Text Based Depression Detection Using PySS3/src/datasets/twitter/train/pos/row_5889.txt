How do you ask someone out?!?!? So I have this crush on this boy and I have been wanting to ask him out but every time I don't know what to say and chicken out. What do you say? Should I do it in person or text?  When do I do it? 

I'm also 'one of the boys' so we joke flirt all the time so I do I get my message across without it sounding like a joke.
