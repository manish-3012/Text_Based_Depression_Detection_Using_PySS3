I saw a really haunting video on 9/11 the other day. Our teacher showed it to us in class and it had peoples last phone calls, actual footage of the plane crashing into the tower. One of the phone calls was like "babe, I'm on a plane and I think it's been hijacked, I love you, tell the kids I love them". 

It really made me realise how bad that event was. 

If anyone you know or cared about died in that event (or any other place or time), then just know that I'm sending prayers for you and your family. You all deserve to be happy, and I am so, so sorry if you've had anyone close to you die.
