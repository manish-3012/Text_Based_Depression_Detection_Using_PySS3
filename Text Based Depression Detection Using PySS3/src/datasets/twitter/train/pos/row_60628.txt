I canâ€™t wait to move out So a few years ago I bought a Cow Mug at a garage sale for like $4. I loved that mug so much. Itâ€™s probably the best thing Iâ€™ve ever boughten. Well a year later my mom puts it in the microwave and it broke. I glued it back together but I canâ€™t use it anymore so itâ€™s just been sitting on a shelf in my room. Iâ€™ve been looking everywhere trying to find a replacement but I havenâ€™t been able to and it makes me so sad. Well tonight I found 2 cow mugs for $23. I just got my first job a couple weeks ago so I have enough money to pay for it myself, but my parents wonâ€™t let me buy it, because they say itâ€™s a waste of money. And theyâ€™re probably right but still. I want to be able to make my own choices about what I buy. It not like I buy things all the time. I barely ever do. And this one time I want to replace something that I didnâ€™t even break, and they wonâ€™t let me. I know this is probably a really stupid thing to get upset about but my parents just donâ€™t ever seem to care.
