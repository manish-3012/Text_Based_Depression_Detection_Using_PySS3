In need of some good advice Thai whole problem involves two friends, and itâ€™s rather simple, just not for me, but getting straight to the point, one of these two friends I have is LGBT, and for me that is obviously fine, but my other friend seems to be somewhat like, not nice towards him, an example is that he always denies going on calls on discord if he is there, and he constantly makes bad remarks and jokes about the LGBT community, I am straight but even with that, Iâ€™d like to help my friend, could anyone tell me how I can do to know if he is actually homophobic or if he is just joking? Any help is appreciated.
