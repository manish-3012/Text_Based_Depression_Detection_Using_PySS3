Whenever I'm up late, my mum comes into my room to wake me up early as a punishment. It's midnight atm and I was trying to find a song for a vid I'm making when she comes in and says "I'm gonna be waking you up 9am". I'm 16 and there is nothing happening tommorow. Anything (realistic) that a could do to convince her to stop?
