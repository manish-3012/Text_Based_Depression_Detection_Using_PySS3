Anybody else have the stupidest inside jokes? So basically someone in the group chat asked how to say worm in Spanish, someone said el wormo and someone said el gusano. Now itâ€™s a war. Someone bought gummy worms just to cut them with scissors and say thatâ€™s what should happen to el wormo. I asked my Spanish teacher the question too, she was extremely confused but she answered (and said it was el gusano) but some of my I d I o t friends think itâ€™s still el wormo despite mounting evidence.
