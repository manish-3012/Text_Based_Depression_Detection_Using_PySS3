I realised that most people here does understand sarcasm and probably a robot or an hivemind. Like jeez man, can't you take a joke? Do you ever had a sense of humour? Do you really think we are serious if we said "oooooooo aaaaaaaaa monke me want banana"? Like, how does it offend you? How you did even think we were serious if we said "monke"? And why you trying to attack us??
