Judging Albums that I've listened too multiple times before (for if you want any new albums to listen too) [10,000 days](https://open.spotify.com/album/1fvWYcbjuycyHpzNPH1Vfk?si=pFH077hHTXeLlDnvILCEGw)

This album is one of my all time favorites. This album is dedicated to the lead singers mom. Two of my favorite songs "Wings for Marie (Pt. 1)" and "10,000 days (wings of. 2) come from this album

[Curtain Call: the hits](https://open.spotify.com/album/1zUY4PAFrNUOCeaEBrEHzh?si=9xwmOViOThyOtZNsVUNXAQ)

I mean this has most of eminem's good songs and one bad song. The songs Stan, The Way I Am, Sing For The Moment, and Cleaning out my closet are some of my all time favorite Eminem songs

6/10

[Lateralus](https://open.spotify.com/album/5l5m1hnH4punS1GQXgEi3T?si=W1a95vZWSYCNEYYXdd2QPA)

This album is one of TOOLs greatest albums. The songs Parabol + Parabola are a excellent 2 part songs. Lateralus is a song based around the Fibonacci Sequence and its honestly a good song to give too. 

8/10

[Ã†nimea](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yWMN087PgSimbcVmHLEwG?si=yTRDEU3NQlSFc4Mv3JJMWQ)

Just above Lateralus this album is another all time favorite. No matter what website you look on this album is almost always at first. This album is tribute to Bill Hicks and it also has some songs from Maynard childhood and his mom. I think this album was Pre-Alex Grey so it doesn't have all the phycadelic art. Songs I reccomend are Ã†nema, Stinkfist, Eulogy, Third eye, Jimmy, Forty Six &amp; 2, and H.

9/10

[Recovery](https://open.spotify.com/album/47BiFcV59TQi2s9SkBo2pb?si=goN4UQCvSL22_hUFhiCo9A)

This is by far one of my favorite Eminem albums. Not Afraid is my all time favorite, Love the way you lie is always a straight up bop.
