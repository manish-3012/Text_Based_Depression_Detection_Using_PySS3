i hate being a boy i hate being told to man up when i am afraid, i hate being called weak, i hate being looked down on because im not a macho man who objectifyâ€™s women, i hate struggling to find friends because guys are all douches and girls always think your hitting on them, i hate trying to find a girlfriend that is genuine, i hate girls can pick from 15 different guys that are hitting on them while ive never been asked out in my life, i hate being told im not allowed to cry because im a boy, i hate being expected to make every decision because im a boy, i hate being told to man up, i hate being expected to sit there and take everybodyâ€™s shit, i hate being treated like a child and expected to act like an adult, i hate being told i cant like things because they arent manly, i hate being told i cant have hair longer than 2 inches, i hate having to take my shirt off at the pool or else im afraid, i hate being called a beta male because im sensitive.I hate when girls act like we have it easy when society nowadays ponders to them, I hate knowing that if my future wife and I divorce theres a 80% chance she will get my children. I hate having nobody to cry to. I hate knowing that 79% of suicides are men. I hate that society doesnt care about men
