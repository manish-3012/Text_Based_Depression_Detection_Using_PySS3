I hate it so much when someone says you are supposed to do something just because you are a boy or a girl I get this multiple times a day. I'm a boy and when the subject about cars comes up and I say I'm not that interested everyone hits me with the "you are a boy you are supposed to like cars". Everytime someone says that to me I lose my mind. This doesn't only happen when talking about cars. Other popular subjects are football, fixing things, drinking and others. Am I the only one that feels like this?
