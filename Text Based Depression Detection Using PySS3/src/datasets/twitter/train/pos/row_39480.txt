Hi yes I canâ€™t sleep Itâ€™s well past midnight, Iâ€™m tired, yet I canâ€™t sleep. I keep going from trying to sleep and then giving up and going on my phone then rinse repeat. This isnâ€™t often but I close my eyes and get scared over... nothing.  Just scared. Also itâ€™s REALLY hot but bc Iâ€™m â€œscaredâ€ I canâ€™t take my blanket off. Please help
