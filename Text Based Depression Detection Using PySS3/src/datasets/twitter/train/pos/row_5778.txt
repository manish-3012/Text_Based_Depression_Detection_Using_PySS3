looking for gaming buddies hey guys, I'm looking for some fellow gamers that would like to join my gaming clan. this isnt a serious clan, it's just for fun and for having people to play with.
we mainly play destiny 2, but we also play minecraft, sea of thieves, apex, warzone, and r6, and we can add other games to the roster upon request. we currently have 8 members, but we do want to grow decently.

requirements:
mic 
discord
good vibes
15 years old or older
speak English 

we dont tolerate any toxic behavior, so you'll be given a warning and kicked if it continues. you'll have a test run period before you're actually confirmed. DM me your discord for an invite
