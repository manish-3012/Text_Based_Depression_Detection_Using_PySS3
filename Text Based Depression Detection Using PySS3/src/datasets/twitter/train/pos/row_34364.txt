I just got scammed by my theology teacher ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'm not religious but at the start of the semester, the theology teacher said anyone who partakes in his class basically gets a free A for the semester regardless of religion.

Well today he was telling us the grades and when he got to me he asked:

"OP, you get an A, are you catholic btw?"

and I was like no, I'm an atheist, and he's like well I can only grade Catholics the rest are counted are as a freely attended course. So I basically got scammed to participate in theology when I didn't even get a grade. The worst part is, I can't lease the course until next year smh
