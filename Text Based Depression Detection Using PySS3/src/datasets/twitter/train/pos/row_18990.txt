I got a gf!! So i met her online, and we live in different states, so we couldn't meet in person, but after abt 1 month of hanging out and msging late at night, she asked me if i liked her, and i said yes. Then she said she did too.  After this we agreed to keep it casual, and that we wouldn't say we were dating, but instead that were just slightly more than friends.  But a couple days ago she added ily to the end when she said gn, and i said it back.  Now today, we agreed that we should date, so now i have a gf, pog.
