Ask an unknown girl for her number for the first time I always found it weird to ask a girl you don't know for her number, I am very bad at guessing ages and I can easily think a girl is my age but she 5 years younger or 10 years older. In conclusion, I never ask a girl i didn't know out and the very few female friends I did asked out weren't interested.

I was on the bus, told to my self "she is cute and my age (i could know for sure), if for some reason we leave the bus at the same station I will ask for her number"

We did leave the bus at the same station and i asked for her number/instagram account (less personal).
 She said she had a boyfriend and we both went on our way.

And know what, I lost nothing and it will not effect me in any way.
