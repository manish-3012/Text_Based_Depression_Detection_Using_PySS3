Will I ever find peace of mind knowing the fact that I have never had a girlfriend and will never have a one? I suffer from OCD. My day is consumed by my OCD. I have never had a girlfriend because I think I'm ugly but my friends and familiy say that I'm handsome. How can I stop worrying about having kids, getting in a relationship when I will never have girlfriend??
