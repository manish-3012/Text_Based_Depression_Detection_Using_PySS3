Hey, quick question, does your mom take up your entire lunch break, misgender you, say that you're never going to get a diploma, call your dad and victimize herself, live her goals through you, and then say that your work is the only thing that matters? All in the span of an hour? I have no idea what to do. Am I socially justified to run away?
