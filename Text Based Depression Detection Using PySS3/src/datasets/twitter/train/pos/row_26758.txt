My parents canâ€™t treat me equally I donâ€™t know where else to post this as I donâ€™t want get my friends involved ( the few I have)
Iâ€™m sick and tired of not being able to not be treated equally by my parents.

They throw fits , slam doors ,yell , click their tongues and have attitudes all the time. But the moment Iâ€™m in a bad mood or irritated, I get yelled at , punished and apparently have an attitude and is disrespectful.

The worst part is that I am depressed and get easily irritated  and they KNOW I am depressed but refuse to acknowledge it because it apparently doesnâ€™t affect how a person feels and behaves

They say because Iâ€™m not an adult (17 years old)
That I canâ€™t be Irritated and they can do what ever they want because itâ€™s their house 

I just needed to write this down 
Thanks
