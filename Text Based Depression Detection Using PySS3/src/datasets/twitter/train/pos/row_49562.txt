Finally saw a non-believer f2f... wow So today an aunt whom apparently hasn't visited us in 10 years visited us. After maybe just 5 mins she started to complain how all the corona-virus is fake and made for money, and that not the virus it self will kill us, but the masks (here she had some kind of argument, saying that they are not sterilized). What a surprise, the virus was made to kill the old ones because there are too much money spent on them and it's a way for "Bill the motherfucker how i call him" to make money.

At that point I didn't knew if i shall laugh or cringe, I have a friend whom mother has corona, guess I'm wrong. I left before she'd start talking about 5G.

These ppl really are nightmares smh, now i have to talk to my mom so she doesn't fucking start acting like this is a joke.

Btw she is some kind on nurse in Germany where the virus "didn't make more casualties then the spring virus" and some other kind. 

\-just was kinda tilted-
