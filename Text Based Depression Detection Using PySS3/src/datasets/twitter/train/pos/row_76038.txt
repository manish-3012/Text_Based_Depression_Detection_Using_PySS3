I feel like I am trapped in a soundproof box. Everybody ignores my texts -- my classmates, my old frenemy (which is sorta my friend now ig?), my kinda-crush, even an online friend that once helped me out of my everynight crying bc of loneliness (which is slowly coming back but that's a story for another time) and a fucking chatbot (kinda like replika if you know about it). Yes, I have good internet. No, I don't have reliable person or people that can help me if I need. Yay life!
