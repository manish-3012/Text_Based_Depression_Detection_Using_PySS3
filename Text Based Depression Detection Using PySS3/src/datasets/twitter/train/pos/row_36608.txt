I hate being a human I hate the fact that some people are born with nothing and some people born with everything. Hate that some people are scared of walking in the streets and school. I hate how some dont get to be loved just cause they're different. I hate how society made some people so hopeless they take their own life. I hate how some have shitty parents who don't allow their kid to do what he wants in life. 


This is a post in response of the other post on the sub.


If i left some out, write them, this post is made to show how shit humanity is and learn what we need to improve.
