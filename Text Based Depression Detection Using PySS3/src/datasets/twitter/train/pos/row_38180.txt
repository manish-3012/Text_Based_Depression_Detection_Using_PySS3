Hey guys I have an idea! For all those people who hate using non gendered pronouns, I have a great idea because you must hate referring to people of different races as people right? So what if we only refer to them a black, brown and white rather than they? Also referring to people as people rather than their sexual orientation must be soooo annoying, so why donâ€™t we do that as well? So call me â€œthat bi person over thereâ€, or â€œthe white was just doing thisâ€! Then weâ€™ll be able to segregate the population so much that thereâ€™ll be so much inequality - and I wonâ€™t have to use those stupidly simple, annoying easy to use non gendered pronouns.

Note: I am not one of the idiots that I am sarcastically impersonating. This is to show the stupidity in their reasoning.
