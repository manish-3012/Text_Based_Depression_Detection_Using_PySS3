Why I'm leaving this sub So before I get into this I just want to make it clear that by no means is this a critique of this sub itself but rather the people involved with it. I also want to make it clear that I'm not encouraging others to leave just because of this post, please do as you wish and don't do anything just because someone says something.

I don't think I'm the only person who has noticed this but this sub is getting increasingly worse, and there are some weird people doing some weird shit. Yes I have trolled in the passed but this (if it even is trolling) is beyond just joking, for example I've seen a post about someone microwaving their underwear and being concerned about having testicular cancer. I know its probably a joke and someone is just trying to have a laugh but either way wtf, do I really have to say anything else about that. Now that obviously isn't the whole sub and there is good people and good content here but it's to bad at this point.

Now once again this is in no way meant to persuade people to leave but more to show the community as well as the staff to think a little harder about what you do, and I'm not saying go on a mod rampage and fucking rid of anything that has a 1% chance of possibly being a troll post but there needs to be a point where it's just to much. Anyways I hope this place gets fixed soon because the good things on here are actually really nice.
