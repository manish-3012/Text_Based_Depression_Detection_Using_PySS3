I aced my first AP test!!! I know this might not sound like much, but I wanted to challenge myself this year and take my first AP class. I studied all the material, psyched myself up before the test with some AOT music, and then I got a 40/42! Iâ€™m so proud of myself and donâ€™t really have anyone to share this with besides my parents, and I just want people to k is Iâ€™m proud of myself!
