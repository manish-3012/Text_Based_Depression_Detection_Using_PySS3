Never compliment someoneâ€™s weight lost Never compliment someone for losing weight, even if you know there are actively trying to any other reason; you never know what youâ€™re actually complimenting. 
Last summer I saw a friend of mine and she lost a lot of weight. Before lockdown she was really hot ( from my beauty standard) and had an ideal body type. She did a lot of sport and it was shown. When I saw her that skinny I felt bad for her and we were talking about that and she told me that because of quarantine she wasnâ€™t able to exercise so she lost all her muscle mass and that was the reason for her being so skinny. She talked about it as a bad thing not a positive. I didnâ€™t know what to do so I told her that she looked fine and for me she was gorgeous and that being skinny suited her face and she shouldnâ€™t worry about it because once she could resume sports she would gain muscles again. I also told her that I was planning on trying to lose weight because I had gained a few pounds. I just thought I had make a nice comment until not long after She told me that she was in the hospital because of anorexia nerviosa and she was in the psychiatric part so her phone was going to be taken away. It was a hard time for me, I was scared since I didnâ€™t know anything more and the worst part was remembering that I had complimented her ED.
