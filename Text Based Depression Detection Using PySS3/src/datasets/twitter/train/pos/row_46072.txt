something i'll never forgot: 2020 is ready to end soon, i have learned many things this year, i've found so many great people here on reddit. i don't want to leave 2020. but there is no other choice, no other chance's. here i sit in my room with a c up of tea in one hand and a guitar in my other hand. 3am and watching the sky while the echos of time repeats over and over. i hear the wind outside and i think, "*there are great days ahead in my life. what if this was all an endless dream?*" i look back and realize that my good and bad days are gone forever. my dog sits by my side. i don't want to sleep but i want to stay up all night. i see a light in the distance and i often wonder, "*god, will i ever meet my grandparents ever again? i want my grandpa back. i want to hug my sister and give my grandpa one last hug.*" i see a rabbit and count the stars. i know there is a gap between life and afterlife. i want to give everything a perfect shot. there is nowhere to go in the afterlife and i want to see my grandparents again. this lump in my throat won't go away for a while. i want to stay in 2020. I love you ataata and bun. pls come back.
