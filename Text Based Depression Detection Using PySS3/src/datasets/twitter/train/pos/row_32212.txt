Quarantine has turned me into an idiot I cant text girls anymore what the h*ck. I didnt text a girl who wasnt just a friend to me for the entire covid thing until now. I actaully cannot text her, like I keep getting worried shes annoyed or if I suck at texting even tho I was pretty good before quarantine. Help what do I do I am unable to text girls now help.
