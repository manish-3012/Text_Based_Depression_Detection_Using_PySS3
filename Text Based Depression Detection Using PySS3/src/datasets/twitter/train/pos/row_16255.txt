I've always been bad at titles Anyway we agree on everything that matters, but we still fight a lot over stupid shit. I don't care though I love fighting with them.
We're also both stubborn af so neither one of us wants to give up the fight and I love that. They're a really good friend and I appreciate them so much it hurts.
1/10 though, would definitely not recommend. They're _my_ friend get your own lol
