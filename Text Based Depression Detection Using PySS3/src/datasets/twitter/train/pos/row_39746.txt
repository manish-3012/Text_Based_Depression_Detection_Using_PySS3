Need help locating some nostalgia  There was a series of simple 2D Minecraft animations from the early 2010s I watched as a kid, with stuff taking place both in the real and in-game world. The only details I can remember are an older sibling bullying his younger sibling and a creeper with a slightly more 'realistic' face and a creepy personality. Jokes about bacon and maple syrup may or may not have been involved, I can't remember. I figured I would just put it here as a shot in the dark.
