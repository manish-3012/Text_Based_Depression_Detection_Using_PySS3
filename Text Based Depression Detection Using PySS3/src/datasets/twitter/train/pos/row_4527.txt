When was a time you had a cultural barrier when talking to someone from a different country? Like when you phrased something a certain way and the meaning got completely mistranslated? For example, I was talking to one of my American friends and told him my XBox controller broke and I was devastated about it. He said I need some perspective in my life if I'm devestated over that. 

In the UK, wd say devastated for everything. "I'm devastated" = "I'm mildy annoyed" it's hyperbole.
