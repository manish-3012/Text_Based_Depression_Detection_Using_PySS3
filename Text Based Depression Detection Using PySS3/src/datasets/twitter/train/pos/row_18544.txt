Le me fucked up by trying to fix my microphone during Zoom meeting. So at the place where i live, Covid is starting to infect more and more people. Hence the Government recently made my state go into semi-lockdown, and my school began online classes.

The time is 9:17 AM. My maths teacher is teaching us about matrices, and asks a few questions about them. Me being someone who likes to answer dem questions, answered them. But it seemed like my microphone didn't work. Not something that i can't fix. So i begin fixing, and halfway through, my mic 'fixes' itself and i don't know that. I 'accidentally' unmute myself and i still don't know that. So my dumb arse thinks,"Why not check whether my mic is working by moaning in it." Pretty S-Tier shit idea isn't it? I perform the mic check and my teacher says, " who is moaning in the meeting, i will remove you."  

Thats when it hit me. I was that dumbo that moaned. I rapidly mute myself as i contemplate my level of stupidity.

tl;dr :- A dumbo (me) moans loudly in the Zoom meeting in which every student is serious af. The teacher surely will deduct my marks in class assessment
