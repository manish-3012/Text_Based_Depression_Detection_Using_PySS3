this is making me depressed literally here's the timeline for december

beginning of december, i lost my best friend/crush. She made me so happy and shit. Wont go into details but we clicked, always had good convos, etc etc. Took 1-2 weeks to get over her. At the same time i decided to make new friends by adding random ppl from quick add on snapchat, I found like 4 or something that actually put time and effort on me

mid-december: Things were going rlly good for me. 

late december: Im hitting a truck again. I lost one really close friend out of nowhere. she just randomly started to hate me. The other girl i found to be deceptive and a liar. The other im still best friends with, i hope she doesnt leave me. And the final one, things are okay i guess. I have a feeling shell leave me too.

Literally losing all my new friends. Whats the point in trying anymore?
