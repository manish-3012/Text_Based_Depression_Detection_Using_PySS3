If you complain about one gender for a shit ton of your personality, youâ€™re likely a very annoying person Its the most annoying thing ever. â€œBut girls are thots and hurt me feewingsðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºâ€ nah I donâ€™t care, if you really feel you have some sort of hatred towards women, maybe go to therapy. Could be a deeper issue


And same for girls who say they hate boys and men. And saying things like â€œI hate being attracted to menðŸ˜£â€. Then just donâ€™t date men? 



Sorry people who act like this just get on my nerves. And they think theyâ€™re different than eachother too. Nope. Youâ€™re the same. Youâ€™re complaining about the exact same problem. You have no excuses for being sexist.
