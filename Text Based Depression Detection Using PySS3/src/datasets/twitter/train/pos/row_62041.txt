Damn this hurts I got reminded of the soundtrack from the newer sonic games and I couldnt stop myself. I had to look up the main theme of Sonic colors cuz Reach For The Stars, is a great song. But holy fuck, i wasnt expecting to hurt this much. I havent played that game in years yet I remember most of the levels and.some of the crazy bosses from each level. It feels as though it was just yesterday, what happened? I was six or seven and now Im almost seventeen.
