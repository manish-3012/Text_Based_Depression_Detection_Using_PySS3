I have a chemestry question English isnt my first language so some words might be weird

I have to calculate the amount of acetic acid in vinegar

We did a titration where we had 10cm^3 of vinegar mixed with 25cm^3 water

It became neutral after we put in 38ml of a sodium hydroxide solution with 0.500 mol/dm^3 sodium hydroxide

How do i do this please help
