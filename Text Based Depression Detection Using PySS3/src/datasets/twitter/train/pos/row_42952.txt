Is PTSD really common I mean, everywhere I go i get told smth like, "you might have childhood trauma" because of stupid stuff for me, like crying when I do homework, or getting a bad garde and being afraid.
But i think PTSD is a really strong word for some people who've actually bee through some disturbing shit. And there's a lot of people running around saying they have PTSD because of this and that. I just feel like that gives less value to other people who's actually traumatised.
The same thing happens with depression and rape victims. I dont know if you understand me tbh.
