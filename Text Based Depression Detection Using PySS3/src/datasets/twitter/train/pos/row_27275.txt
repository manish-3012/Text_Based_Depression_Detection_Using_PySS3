it has come to my attention that according to reddit statistics 90% of people who view my posts dont actullally follow me. if youre seeing this post i trust that you are but if you could just check that would be amazing. sometimes reddit glitches out and removed you from following me so if you could just check if you still are that would be very poggers.
