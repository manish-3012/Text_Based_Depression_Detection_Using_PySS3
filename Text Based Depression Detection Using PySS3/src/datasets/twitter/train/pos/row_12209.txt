Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics just so that he could play Spider-Man in his own produced movie. Stan Lee opened up about Jackson's ambitions at a 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. He'd been visiting Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, he said "He wanted to do Spider-Man. I'm not sure whether he just wanted to produce it, or wanted to play the role. Our conversation never got that far along."
