Guys "Earo101", a teenage youtuber, needs serious help. Earo101 made a video where he said that if he gets 5 likes he'll roll down the stairs, he got 5 likes, but luckily he couldn't do it as he said in his last video. I think he needs help, his channel his named, I already reported him to Iasp (European suicide prevention) and National Suicide Prevention Lifetime, some support for this guy would be appreciated, the reasons of why he wants to end it are in the comments of his last 2 videos, pls help him. 

Thanks.

And sorry for bad english.
