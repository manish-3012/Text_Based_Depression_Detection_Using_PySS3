High School Sucks Seriously for the last 3 years ive been in an absolute hellhole known as high school. The majority of people in this school hate me I feel for virtually no reason. I look into peoples eyes and all I see back is either hatred or snarkyness. Everyone feels so over the top about how they are better than me. There are days where I am fine being at the bottom of the high school structure though there are days where I just hate every single fucking high schooler. From what they have done from how they act about things. The insults they come up with. I hate this damn school. I hate it with all the fiber of my being. Im not alone. Some days I feel like fucking screaming in everyones face. The people that rub it in that im at the bottom. I try my best to do things to get on top but I will never join it. And I fucking hate it all.
