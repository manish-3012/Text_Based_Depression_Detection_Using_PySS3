My brother likes to dress up as an anime girl.. Is this normal? He is 20 years old and he is kinda weeb.. So is this some kinda weeb thing? He also has filmed himself while dancing and shaking his ass while dressing as an anime girl...

Or might this be sign that he wants to be a girl? One weird thing I also has noticed is that most of the girls he has dated are manly.

The more I think this actually starts making more sense because he also does lot of drugs and drinks alcohol a lot, maybe he is trying to hide his feeling because he is too scared to come out of the closet..

Also he doesn't know that I know about his secret.

What should I do?
