Wanna hear a weird school-love story including me? So last year I got a crush on a girl in my class and in the end of November 2019 I told my feelings for her ... she rejected me. In December I was so sad about it that I tried it at another girl from my class (even tho I didnt have a crush on this girl now) and I did it! I got together with this girl for like 2 months but then broke up with her (for normal reasons I dont wanna talk 'bout) and because of both events of the past, all girls in my class treated my like a so called fuckboy while the boys congruated me for my relationship with the other girl.
In March 2020 I didnt have a crush on anyone and I liked that, but there was a twist: The girl I 'loved in November 19 suddenly became waaaayy nicer and friendlier to me for no explainable reason, but I didn't care.
(Move forward to last day of the school year (8th grade) )
I tried one last time to get in a relationsship with the gir I loved at the beginning because I kinda had the feeling that she secretly loved me in the last couple months, so I told her all of that.
 * The Dialogue after I told her all *
Her: Im sorry but... im already in a relationsship with someone of this class.
Me: Wtf with which boy?
Her: It doesn't have to be a boy 
* She turns around and went to another girl of my class which was nearby *
Me in my head: No... no It cant be...
* Both girls started kissing each other while I was about to tear up ( The last time I cried back then was in like Sept. 2019 or so) *
