Anyone else feel like COVID has been great for school this year, especially if you're finishing? So, I was just accepted into university early thanks to COVID (so excited) and Uni's freaking out about filling numbers. That, on top of the fact that my state has removed an assignment from each subject made this year one of the easiest schooling years I've had. And honestly the 4 weeks of School I missed from lockdown were great spending time chilling at home and playing online with mates. Anyone else feel like despite all the negativity this year it's been a positive one?
