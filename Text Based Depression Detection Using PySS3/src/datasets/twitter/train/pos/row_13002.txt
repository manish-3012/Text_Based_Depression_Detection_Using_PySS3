OLD: I am 24 right now, and I am writing a novel about my high school experience, which was rather unique, if anyone wants to read this WIP the link is down below. Seriously folks, I had one crazy ride through my teenage years. (15-19) to be precise, and one I would like to share.

If anyone is interested in reading it, I would really appreciate it.
