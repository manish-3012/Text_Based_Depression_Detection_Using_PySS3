I need advice to help a friend who can't move on from a girl I have a friend who is deeply attracted and in love with this girl (I don't know who) and I'm trying to tell him that there's someone who's better later down the road. He says she's the only reason why he gets up everyday and why he keeps on living. I'm getting really worried for my friend. What should I say to help him?
