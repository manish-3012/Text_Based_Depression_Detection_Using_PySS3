I just stood up to the bullies of my sister! Okay this may not seem like a big thing for anyone but for me it DEFINITELY is. My sister is 14 and she comes home every now and then while crying or under the mud from being pushed out, it's heartbreaking. 

She's being bullied by 3 guys of around my age (17) and they're just straight up dickheads thinking that they are everything and can do anything they want. 
So while I was cycling back home I coincidentally saw my sister approaching past the boys and of course as usual they we're being little shits. (There's no faster route home therefore she has to walk past them almost every day). 

Now these guys are around 17 aswell so probably not afraid to deliver a punch or two. Idk what happened but as soon as I saw them just pushing my sister somekinda rage bubbled up. I went there, dropped my bicycle on the ground and just pushed on of them on ground and screamed something like "if you don't leave her alone Il break your neck" (dunno how I was supposed to do that, but it did the job). 
Then while I was approaching one of the others he just backed off being afraid of ME, not so badass anymore huh?. After that I just took my bike, and my sister and I walked back home together.

It was actually very scary but I'm glad they we're just showoffs and not actually "badasses", since it would have probably ended up with an actual fight then.

Thanks for listening &lt;3
