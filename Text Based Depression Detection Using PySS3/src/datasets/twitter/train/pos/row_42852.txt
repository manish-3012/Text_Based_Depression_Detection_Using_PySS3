I just got banned from r/WitchesVsPatriarchy just for posing a different viewpoint. I wasn't even being hateful in my comment, I purely was just stating a different opinion and said that I was open for a discussion. What is even going on? I thought reddit was trying to be a more liberal place, but that sub is just pure misandry, and it didn't get banned like r/theredpill despite doing the same thing, just to the opposite gender. Why? We're supposed to be equal, right? Then why is it okay for them to talk so violently about men, *but* when men talk violently about women, they are silenced? Mirroring the past is not going to change anything, we need to be more tolerant of other's opinions. 

Reddit is becoming more bias, and I believe they need to rethink their strategy. 

Thanks for reading.
