Honestly, text post weekends are the best You don't need to see all the spam of all the people just taking pictures of whatever. You just go into posts, comment on someones comment or post and the you talk, and then boom, you've got someone to talk to for at least 10 minutes, most likely longer. I wonder, what is your opinions on text post weekends?
