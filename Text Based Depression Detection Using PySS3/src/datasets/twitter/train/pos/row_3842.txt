Ok, that's enough... Yesterday I've blown up. I can't stand my younger brother's insults. He can do whatever he wants to me just 'cause he's younger. Yesterday has been the drop that broke the camel's back. I started yelling at him in front of my parents and then went to my room crying. I can't stand him anymore. I'm tired of his insults. Better for him if he cuts it out, or he can start to not consider me as an older brother anymore...



Sorry if my english is bad, I'm italian, but I really had to get it off my chest...
