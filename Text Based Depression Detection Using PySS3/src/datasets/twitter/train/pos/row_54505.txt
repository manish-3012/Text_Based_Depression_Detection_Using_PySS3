I screwed up I was adding random people i remember on snapchat, and one person I knew from 6th grade actually added me back. she asked how I got her snap. and like an IDIOT I told her I quick added her (I didnt). she said that I didn't, so I told her the truth, that I was just looking up random peoples names. she says she doesn't believe me, so I told her I wasn't lying, and she removed me.
now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go jump off a cliff.
