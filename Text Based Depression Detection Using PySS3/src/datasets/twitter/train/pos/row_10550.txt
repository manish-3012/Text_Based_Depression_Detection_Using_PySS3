Ok so this is long ( content warning: uh oh sortof relationship advice) I don't really know where to start or how to format this so I'm going to put numbered paragraphs        



  **1.** Ok so where I'm from on snapchat we use this thing called yolo, it lets you send anonymous messages to someone when they put the link on their story, and they post their answers on their story ( I don't really know how many other people use this).



**2.** When I was in primary school (that's roughly 5years old to 11years old for Americans. I don't know how your school system works) there was this *girlll* . She might have been in into me, but she might of not ( my classroom was pretty big on gossip, mostly fake) . Anyways I moved on to secondary school, she moved on the year later, and we sortof stopped talking. I don't think I really ever had any feelings for her back then. But now I'm in third year, she's in second( were in different schools, but don't live too far away from each other) , and we had a few pretty long conversations over snapchat, and you know waht? I think i *like* like her now. She's genuinely just a great person, and is just really nice to everyone, and we have a good bit in common. ( I'm prob not going to be asking her out anytime soon tho ) 




**3** so yesterday she put a yolo on her story ( the first one ive seen her do). It said something about tell me what u think about me, or something along those lines. I had just come back from a really stressful say at school ( anxiety was butt-fucking me pretty hard ) so when I saw this I was just like why the hell not. So I typed out this paragraph about how cool she is to everyone, and how I can really respect that, yada yada, and I ended it with a ":)"( I've been using :) to end texts and shit recently, she might have guessed it was me from that but probably not) 




** 5 : finally the end **    ok 10 minutes r so later she answers saying that's so kind and your so much greater ( because shes so nice that way lol) and says I can sb if u want too ( just means snap back/ swipe up to chat for those people who mightnt know) soooo I don't know if I should or if I shouldnt let her know it was me because I don't want to ruin the the friendship ( only like 10 conversations on snapchat but still)  or weird her out so I just wanted to know you're guyses opinions on the whole situation     (if you're reading this then holy shit well done man. Here have some cake ðŸ°) ( also I definitely overthink things ) (allllso sorry if theirs any spelling mistakes, i can't be arsed to read over this again)
