I woke up late for my class, what should I do I had ankle surgery yesterday in the morning, and I was so anxious that I didnâ€™t get any sleep. So now Iâ€™m 45 minutes late for my first class, and Iâ€™m just going to miss that one

But should I show up for the rest of my classes, or just use my surgery as an excuse to get out of them? I have a couple days of work that I really need to do that I have to do due to doctorâ€™s appointments and such. My parents are fine with me missing classes because they feel really bad for me since my ankle hurts pretty bad

Also note: Because of online school and the lack of preparation, my school only does three classes a day and the classes are pretty pointless, itâ€™s just the teacher lecturing us on random stuff for an hour and we do all the learning outside of class with our assignments
