Can I get some LGBTQ+ advice please??? So Iâ€™m pansexual and (kinda) closeted. 

I want to come out to my parents but I donâ€™t know how. I came out to my brother and sister (who are thirteen and seven) and theyâ€™re fine about it but I donâ€™t know how to come out to my parents.

They are religious but itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re going to disown me or anything. I have friends who are LGBTQ+ and theyâ€™re fine with them. I just donâ€™t know how to tell them in any way.
