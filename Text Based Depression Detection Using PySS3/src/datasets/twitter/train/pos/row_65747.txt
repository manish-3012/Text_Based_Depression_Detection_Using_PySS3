So, this happened yesterday. Also this is my first post here So yesterday I was in science class, and this one kid Is sitting next to me. He is the classes lowest scorer. So he is sitting next to me and I see him sneeze in his mask and he then proceeds to WIPE THE SNOTTY MASK into his hand.

So, the class finishes and he passes by me and tries to sneakily wipe his hand on me. I shove him away and tell him to keep his hands to himself. He then walks away.

P.s: At the end of the school day he took the bottle of window cleaner thinking is desinfectant and uses it.
