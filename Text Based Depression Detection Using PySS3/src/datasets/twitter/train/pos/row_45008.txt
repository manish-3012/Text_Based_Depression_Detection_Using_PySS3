I just don't know what to do anymore This pandemic and everything that's going on with it is taking a toll on my mental health. I'm starting to hate everything and everyone around me. I love my family and all, but being cramped in the house with everyone 24/7 is making me go fucking crazy.

And don't get me started on school. The education system already sucked before, but the online schooling experience somehow made it worse. I'm fucking sick of sitting on my ass in front of a computer screen for 6 hours a day while listening to the teacher ramble about whatever the fuck she's teaching. The truckload of homework they give every day doesn't help at all. At this point I'd do anything to go back to school normally and be able to communicate with my friends in person. But fucking Corona isn't showing any signs of stopping, so I don't see that happening any time soon.

There's not much I can do these days when I'm bored, other than watching YouTube, listening to music or browsing reddit. And dear god the Wi-Fi is fucking horrible these days. Just attempting to play an online game makes my butthole clench with anguish. 

I just feel really down these days. It doesn't feel like there's any light at the end of the tunnel. And I don't have anyone to share my feelings with. If I tried talking to my parents, they would probably just blame all my problems on my phone. I wish I had a good friend or an older sibling to talk to. I guess the best word to describe my feelings is "empty". I know that my problems are probably miniscule compared to all the people out there in the world who are suffering way more than I am. But I just have no idea what to do. Life doesn't seem worth living anymore. Thanks for reading
