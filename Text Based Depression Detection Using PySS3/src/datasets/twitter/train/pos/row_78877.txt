Im 17, and im just now discovering lofi. Let me tell you it's some of the best music I've listened to in a while. Savior -beowulf is my fav. I even made my own lyrics to sing to it, gonna record it soon, I might post it here. I don't know how I never listened to this genre, a lot of my friends listen and talk about it.
