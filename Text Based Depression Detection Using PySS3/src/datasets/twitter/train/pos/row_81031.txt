My parents just got mad at me for not liking a movie that I didn't want to watch in the first place. So basically, my parents wanted to watch Ocean's 12 with me (I explicitly told them I didn't want to watch it right now) but they insisted so anyway. I didn't like it and thought there were too many things to keep track of. Then my parents hit me with something along the lines of "that's what makes it interesting, is that you have to think about it like a math problem" what the fuck? No, that is not the point of a movie. I'm not supposed to fucking think about it, I'm supposed to watch it and be able to understand it without trying very hard.
