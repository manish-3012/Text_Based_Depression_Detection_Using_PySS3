reminder for those celebrating columbus day FUCK columbus

hereâ€™s a short list of things columbus has done :)

-he kidnapped and gave a carib woman to a crewmate to rape

-a member of his crew cut off native american peopleâ€™s ears to shock others into submission, columbus did nothing

-he kidnapped and enslaved 1000+ people on the island of hispaniola 

-he forced native people to look for and collect gold for him, otherwise they would be executed

-after taking over an island, only 0.17% of the natives there survived 

-he sold multiple girls from the ages 9-10 into sex slavery

-after publicly beheading native american people, they were left where they were tied up

thanks for coming to my ted talk and not celebrating columbus
