It's my Birthday today I wanted to have my pc by now, or get a shonen jump subscription so I could read manga but we cant afford it right now, which really sucks, I got R500 in birthday money which I guess I'm gonna spend in a few months when I have my pc, I am excited to be able to use the family pc to play minecraft all day, my parents were gonna let me have a beer but the fucking dumb South African government isn't allowing sale of alcohol on weekends right now for some reason, end of my post just wanted to put this out there
