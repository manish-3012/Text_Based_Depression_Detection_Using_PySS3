The text I got from this lady, man... it made me pretty glad â€œSteven I want you to know that even though I practically met you just this year youâ€™ve been one of the best people Iâ€™ve met and Iâ€™m so happy and proud to consider you a friend, thank you for coming into my life â¤ï¸ðŸ˜­â€

What is this? I donâ€™t know why, but it just warms my heart. A person that actually considers me a friend in a very healthy and kind way instead of just vibing and bullying me? I really thought that she was just talking to me out of pity because at first I had no idea she felt like that about me, and I donâ€™t really feel close to anybody. So somebody who treats me kindly, it makes me glad I suppose. That being said I canâ€™t expect much from people since you never know when theyâ€™re just gonna leave
