Stand battle against A karen I'm on mobile so ye. And ignore the title in done now


It was just a normal day. Sippin tea, reading the paper, losing some fingers in a accident, etc


It was all fine and dandy until i got called into work
( Yare yare daze) so I haul ass to work and make right before it opened. A hour into work and a classic looking karen comes up and I ring her up. Me: me karen:k

Me: that will be 30.84$  

K: oh poo. I didnt bring enough, could you give me a discount?

Me: no

K: please? Imma single mother

Me: then where are you kid?

K: in the car

Me: (bitch slaps k) YOI LEFT YOU KIDS IN A CAR IN THIS HEAT?!

K: and? It's not even that hot

Me: you dumbass, it's ten at night and the sun's still up ( prolly a stand) and the heats a fucking bitch 

K: so? Am I getting a discount?

Me: no. Pay or leave

K: please? For a single mom? 

Me: NO STILL AND ALWAYS MEANS NO

K: THERE'S NO NEED TO BE RUDE! I WANT YOUR MANAGER!

Me: I am the manager, and its still a nope

K: ( menacing face/ pose) I tried to give you a chance 

I go to grab her but, a arm emerges from her shoulder and throws me across the room

Me: w-w what!

K: should've givin the discount. Tell me, is your job worth dying for?

Me: ...

K: o well 

The arm aims for my chest and shoot acrylic nails into my torso causing me to feel immense pain

Me: AHHHHHH YOU BITCH!

The arm gets ready to fire again

K: hahahahahahaha. You will suffer the same fate as the rest

The arm shoots the nails 

Me: IM NOT DYING THIS WAY! ( my stand emerged from behind deflecting the nails) 

K: (gasp) y-y you have a-a stand 

Me: yes. I though I was the only one heh ( my stand removes the nails from my chest and places a hand on my wounds making it like ot never happened)

K: stand or no stand you can't win against my manager ( the stand emerges from behind k resembling her damn near perfection)

K: (stand) MANAGER!

The stand lobs a punch at me but I Dodge and the stand then throws a barrage

K: (stand) MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MANAGER MAN-AGER!

My stand Blocks half the punches while the rest find their way into my torso

Me: gahhh (blood speed from my mouth)you won't
Win


K: hahaha its futile to resist the inevitable ( she starts to walk off without paying) have a nice day

Me: No you won't get away, gahhh *cough cough*

Me: GET HER MIDNIGHT KISS!

K: NANI!?
My stand flies infront of her and starts attacking

K :HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA!!

Me: what? How?

K: my stand gets stronger when I'm out of sight of a security camera and unfortunately your sad ass store has none, so my stand is more powerful.

Me: dammit

K: since you such a strong manager I'll add you to my manager arsenal

Me: your what?

K: ( her stand unscrews its head and Karen pulls out a name tag with a name and manager title. She throws it on the ground and the zombie-fyed manager apppeared)

Me: that's the manager who went missing last week

K: yep. He refused to make things go my way so I killed and now he's like this. Hes my little puppet doing whatever I please

Me: you bitch, that man has a family

K: and? My family is way more important

Me: YOU SELF ABSORBED BITCH! GO MIDNIGHT KISS! (Stand) SEPPUN!

K: didnt i say it's futile? (Stand) MANAGER!

Our stand throw barrages at each other parrying each punch

K: HAHAHAH YOU WONT WIN ITS FUTILE HAHAHA WRYYYYYYYYY 

Karen's stand over powers my stand and sends me flying

Me: ahhhhhh

K: just stop resisting. Your dying anyway, so just stop resisting my kid are in the car waiting

Me: (I send my stand to the nearest tech store) I think your kid will be better off dead than continue living with you

K: HOW DARE YOU!? ANY KID WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE ME FOR A MOM

Me: you dont act like it, I mean you left them in a hot car

K: they'll be fine

Me: if there lucky they'll be dead

K: NOW YOU DIE BASTERD!

My stand returns in the nick of time and hands me my key to victory. A camera

Me: smile your on camera ðŸ˜€ 

K: no, get that away from me. Get it manager (stand) MANAGER.

The stand goes to attack the camera in my hands but my stand blocks and beats the everloving shit out of them

K: Gahhhhh

Me: you will now pay for you crimes

K: please no, i got a family. Please forgive me?

Me: Okay

K: really?

Me: yea. Just go to each family of each managers you killed and tell them you killed their father/ husband and ask for forgiveness

K: no. They'll be mad at me and wont forgive me

Me: thats a you problem

K: there must be another way? If I promise to never do it again will you spare me?

Me: no 

K: come on. You should let me live so I can take care of my kids. And you should give me my stuff for free

Me: even in the face of death your still a bitch

K: I'll pay you

Me: how much?

K: (pulls out one dollar) here 

Me: no 

K: you ungrateful bastard, when someone wants to give you money you take no matter how much it is

Me: lady your trying to pay to live and you offer me one damn dollar?

K: you should let me live anyway. I deserve it!

Me: so dont you think the manager deserve to live?

K: no. I'm more important

Me: well now you pay

Karen died due to being beaten beyond recognition. sadly the managers she killed were not restored and their family's mourn their lost loved ones. Turns out karen haf kid but they  we're grownups. As for me I went back home read some reddit stories and went to sleep
