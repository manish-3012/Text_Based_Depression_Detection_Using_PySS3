We got some incels here now huh As a man, I think it is NOT good to make this absolute shitposts about generalizing women. Iâ€™ve come across a post about some â€œgirl want rich guyâ€ shit that honestly makes it seem like itâ€™s a troll. Seriously, this isnâ€™t some sitcom or romance movie where the girl is always the same in every movie. And no, you are an incel, just because itâ€™s a â€œmemeâ€ does not take away from how fragile u are. Good bye, merry christler
