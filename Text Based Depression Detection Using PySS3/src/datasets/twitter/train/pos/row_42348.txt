seems like covid is never gonna end  I just have this feeling that covid is gonna last forever and it's never gonna be the same and we're destined to live in misery. even if the virus disappears, the economy is still gonna be fucked. I'm so sad about this and it feels like nothing's gonna change for the better which sucks ass:(
