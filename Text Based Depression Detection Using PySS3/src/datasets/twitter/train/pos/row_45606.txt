No Nut November Its officially No Nut November.

No Nut November, or as I like to call it, *the trials* begin today.
Some of you will not make it, some of you will give up.
The difficulty will be immense, amd the temptation nearly unbearable, but we shall not give up, nor shall we quiver in the face if danger!
Only the true elite can survive the Trails.
I beleive in you.

Lets the games begin.
