Older Redditors are so sensitive. Say something that they don't like or agree with and you'll get downvoted to oblivion. Hell, not even that, but I always seem to get downvoted for asking basic questions. Obviously this doesn't apply to every older person, but holy shit. Way to shut me down completely with your "holier than thou" attitude.
