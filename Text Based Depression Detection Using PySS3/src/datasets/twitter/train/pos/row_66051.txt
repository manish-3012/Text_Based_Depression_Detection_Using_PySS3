I can not sleep and I'm about to go insane I did everything to sleep. I stopped answering the phone two hours before I went to sleep. No technology at all. But every time I try to sleep, I start a dialogue in my head or a song gets stuck. I keep thinking about things that don't happen, and it keeps going on and on. It's like an never-ending dead end. When I can't sleep, I read some books and it has a little effect. Then again in my head, the scenarios come to life and the same thing is happening. What should I do???
