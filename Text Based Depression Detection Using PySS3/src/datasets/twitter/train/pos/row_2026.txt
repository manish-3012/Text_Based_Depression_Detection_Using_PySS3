I keep finding myself haunted with increasingly intense feelings of nostalgia I have such good memory that, literally almost anything triggers it. Songs I used to listen to just 3 months ago.
Certain furniture, games, tvs, toys, smells, tastes, pictures, dreams, nightmares, every once in a while I look at different parts of my body and think, "I'm starting to look more and more like an adult". I'm going to be 16 soon and I can already feel myself grieving as if im slowly losing myself. Thats how I feel at least. Then there's all of my friends on xbox and minecraft...

I don't know what to do to stop this.

Right now I'm just sitting and staring at random things and thinking about the past. What can I do to stop this?
