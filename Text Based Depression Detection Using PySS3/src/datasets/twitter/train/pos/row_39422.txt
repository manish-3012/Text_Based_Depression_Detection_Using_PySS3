I know this post is long and i doubt any one cares but fuck it i need to vent My parents split up a couple months ago and im really not handling it well i have been talking to a therapist who diagnosed me with a severe depressive episode i dont want to get help from my friends because i dont want them to worry or anything and all i do is make jokes about my mental health and i just want to be happy and normal please for the love of god just let me be normal im sick of feeling like shit i dont even think it started with my parents splitting up because they fought for years and i just feel like absolute shit because all they fought about was money and i know having a child is expensive and having four would be so fucking expensive but i just feel like if i had never been born my parents would be so much happier all i ever do is fight with my mum and my dad didnt want me to stay at his place last weekend like i normally do because he "had something more important to tend to" i also know that im just being a big bitch and that i have it so much fucking easier than alot of other people and i should be grateful for that but i cant and im fucking scared man

im fucking scared
