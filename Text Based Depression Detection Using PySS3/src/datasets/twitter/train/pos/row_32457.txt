Can somebody please explain to me why people say no homo? I honestly have no clue if the LGBT community accepts this and is fine with it or if my friends are literally all just homophobic and insensitive. On a related note, why is it acceptable to use gay as an insult or call people f*g? I was always taught that it was considered a slur like the N word. Pls give me a serious answer and pls donâ€™t hate me.
