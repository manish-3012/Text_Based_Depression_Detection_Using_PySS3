Helo fellow cool teenagers, I need your help  Aight so the thing is that I haven't studied shit in school this year, and by that I actually mean I haven't studied a single thing, copied everything on my test from google. My mid term exams just ended and now I need to study but the thing is that I just can't study. Firstly I have to complete the syllabus from scratch in half the time and also I tried studying but I can't study for more than 5 mins. Any help on how to start studying and on how to complete the full syllabus from scratch in half year would be appreciated. Asking for help here cause I can't tell anyone irl
