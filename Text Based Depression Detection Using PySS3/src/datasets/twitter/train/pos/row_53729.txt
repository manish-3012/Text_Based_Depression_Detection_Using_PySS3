Things I find satisfying I decided to write just a bunch of things I find satisfying, and I hope you do too.

\- Finding the perfect temperature during a shower

\- Clicking shuffle on Spotify and the song matches perfectly to the mood your in

\- Splitting an Oreo perfectly in half so each side has the same White Stuff

\- Opening Call of Duty Modern Warfare without having to update

\- Getting a Nostalgic video on your recommended feed on YouTube

\- High-Fiving someone perfectly

\- Sharpening a pen and not breaking it when you first start writing with it

\- Receiving a message from your crush

\- Setting an analogue watch to be 100% perfect with the actual time

\- The roar of a V-8

\- Drawing a hand perfectly the first time

\- Dropping the needle on a Vinyl without any scratchiness

\- Receiving a call from your Mum or Dad saying they will be later than usual, and then asks what type of fast food they should bring home

\- Holding down the volume button and letting go at the perfect number

That's pretty much all I've got for me, there's millions more but I can't really remember them all.
