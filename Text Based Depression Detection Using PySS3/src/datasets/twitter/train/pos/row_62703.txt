The gods of luck are on my side even thought Iâ€™m a idiot and a procrastinator Last night I was unable to sleep until 12pm. I have my ACT test today and I was terrified that I was too tired to do it. I somehow freaking did those 2 tests with only a minute left on the clock! I somehow did good (or just ok... donâ€™t know the scores yet) on them and I donâ€™t know how. Please donâ€™t be a dumb dumb like me and get sleep before the ACT! Also I forgot how to do Cos Tan and the other things so I would recommend if you are taking the math ACT to study them.
