lmao I'm finally getting my life back together 14 male. not a native english speaker.

I have been addicted to my pc (gaming, surfing the web) for about 6 years now. I'm proud to say I haven't touched my pc for two weeks and today I deleted tiktok which has always disgusted me but was so addicting, it's a big achievement to me and the start of a new life.

I didn't really go out with friends alot and was mainly in my house being on my pc or at the pool in a practice (waterpolo if anyone knows, mix of swimming and a game in water). 

I was never depressed but I always felt my lifestyle is wrong and I should change it, I felt like I was wasting time and potential. 

school started two days ago and I met this cute girl which is new to our school, I'm gonna try and get to know her and ask her out.

 I feel like everything is going well yet I'm still careful and trying to keep everything together and not just let the world to fix me up.

I'll update if anything interesting happens. thanks for reading my fairly boring post!
