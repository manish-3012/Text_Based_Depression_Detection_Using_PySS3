UPDATE! i talked to him! IT WENT SO WELL!

everyday me and my friend go to the same class because itâ€™s warm. i do not have it but my crush and her do he came in early that day giving me enough time to ask him to hang out at lunch. and we did! we talked a lot and it went really well...he stood really close to me and even made eye contact ahahahah screaming in a pillow like a girl kicking her feet in the air ...i didnâ€™t ask for his number yet. but iâ€™m so happy :D
