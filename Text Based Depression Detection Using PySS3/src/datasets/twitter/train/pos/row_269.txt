I donâ€™t care if my friend is homophobic heâ€™s still my friend I know this will get hate but screw it. My friend is homophobic and I donâ€™t care and itâ€™s never affected me and heâ€™s never harmed anyone because of it. Iâ€™ll never let go of a friend because he has a bad opinion or something. What he says or does is more important to me than what he thinks.
