So itâ€™s been a half a year So I have been having this stupid dream for half a year
Every time I sleep more than 3 hours I get this dream where I die in various ways.

Firstly I thought itâ€™s ok soon it will be fine, but nothing changed. Worst of all in the dream I have happen on exactly one day 2024/03/17 exactly four years of time. I donâ€™t know if it will really happen and I die but having this dream every night is tiring. 

For about a month now I sleep with alarm which go off every 2 hours so I can get some peaceful sleep. My parents donâ€™t think itâ€™s something serious. I always try to distract myself whenever I think about it. 

Iâ€™m tired do you guys have any suggestions.
Btw meeting with psychologist didnâ€™t work , also tried medicine didnâ€™t work.
