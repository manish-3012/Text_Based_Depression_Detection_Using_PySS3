Me trying to get everyone to play Helltaker Me: Helltaker is a puzzle game, being a free game, it has about 3 hours of playtime, too 100%, the puzzle are challenging, but it feels rewarding to finish them

The main pull of the game is the demon girls, they all have *intresting* lore and personality. I donâ€™t want to spoil it to much, but justice is best girl

The community is a lot more, elegant when talking about who is best girl? I donâ€™t recommend going to the subreddit until you finish the game tho
