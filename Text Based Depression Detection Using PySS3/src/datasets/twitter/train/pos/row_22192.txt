Day 20 of posting my favorite bit of lyrics from a song on my Spotify playlist. "You've got your mother in a whirl 'cause she's not sure if you're a boy or a girl. Hey babe, your hair's alright. Hey babe, let's stay out tonight. You like me, and I like it all, we like dancing and we look divine. You love bands when they're playing hard. You want more and you want it fast. They put you down, they say I'm wrong. You tacky thing, you put them on." from Rebel Rebel by David Bowie
