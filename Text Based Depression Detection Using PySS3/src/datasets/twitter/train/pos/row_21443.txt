Mcdonalds secrets as a former employee 1. Your food probably touched the ground before you ate it.

2. We donâ€™t use gloves or anything for hygiene.

3. Everything is frozen

4. The ice-cream machine is not broken, just no one can be bothered to clean it because it takes long asf and no one wants to do it so we say its â€˜brokenâ€™.

5. Most people are drunk or high while working

6. If youâ€™re a rude customer, your food will be violated before it gets to you without you ever knowing.
