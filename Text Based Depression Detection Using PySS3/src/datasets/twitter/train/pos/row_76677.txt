I'm failing because of my teacher, not because of me My teacher doesn't regrade, she doesn't explain anything clearly and she gives us extremely hard work that we need to figure out ourselves. Not to mention she hasn't given us a break it's just constant work work and more work. I have to go to her office hours and stay after class just to pass this class it's so annoying.
