MY DIARY. DAY 11, 12, 13, 14, 15: I WAS TOO HIGH TO KEEP THE DIARY THOSE DAYS. So basically i bought weed and got really high an i was to tired and busy to keep the diary these days. but also i got 98% on math work. i vibed a lot and today i went ice skating for 3 hours. also i played ice hockey with da boys. And now i've got pneumonia bc it was -20â°C outside.
