I feel like I can barely focus on anything and my head is throbbing Like actually, I can feel my heartbeat through my head even though I haven't been doing any exercise

I just wanna lie on the ground on my back but my dad would yell at me if he saw me doing that so I guess instead I'm gonna be miserable and keep my laptop open so that he thinks I'm working
