Guys I need your help for something important The story is absolute shit so buckle up. I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting. I had a crush on this girl in my school 2yrs ago. Then there was the virus. Now we are back and she is cuter than ever, and I'm still overweight(not obese tho). made the stupid mistake of telling one of my "friends" about it, and they instantly spread the news, telling everyone. I deny it completely, tell her it was not true, (because if the teachers discover, I will be in a shit ton of trouble) and she believes me. Now, how do I completely destroy the snitch who leaked the news?
