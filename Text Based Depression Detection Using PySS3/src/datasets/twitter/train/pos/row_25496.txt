moving fucking sucks I used to live in California but my family moved for the east coast 3 years ago. I thought I'd warm up to the east coast but this place still fucking sucks after living here for this long. I had one friend during my first year, a large group of friends my second year, and now I'm in my third year with zero friends in the east coast. The only friends I currently have still live in California. I really want to move back so I can see them. I even have a romantic interest who lives there but we can't even be together because I live in a shithole state that's across the fucking country. Even my good family lives in California and I don't even get to see them. I also would've went to a very nice and small private school with friends if I still lived there. I only visit VERY occasionally and also during New Years. I haven't spent a single New Years outside of California and I don't plan on changing that. This year, that's going to change because of covid and now I'm really worried. Every night I have trouble sleeping because I think of how much better my life would be if I still lived in California. I would literally give anything to move back. Fucking anything...
