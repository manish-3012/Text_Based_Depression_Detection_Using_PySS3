What are some fun Christmas gift ideas for 16-18 year olds? Maybe popular tik tok gifts? I wanna give my friends something funny but maybe also useful this year. I already got one part of their gift, which is the reversible octopus plushy that indicates their mood, but Iâ€™m not sure what else besides snacks and candy.

Any suggestions that you have? Maybe itâ€™s something trendy or on tik tok?

Thanks!
