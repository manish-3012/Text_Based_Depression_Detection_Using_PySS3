Does anyone else actually like their parents? I love my parents that doesn't mean they don't annoy me sometimes but I never actually talk to many people who think the same thing as me. I realize that most of the things they do are rational things and what good parents would do. Now I understand some people have good reasons to dislike their parents and I'm not saying that they don't matter or that they are just complaining just figured I'd clear this up.
