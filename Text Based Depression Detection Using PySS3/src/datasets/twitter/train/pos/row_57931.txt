If you participate in cancel culture you are no better then a Karen. The mentality of â€œletâ€™s ruin this guyâ€™s career because he said the n-word 10 years agoâ€ or really anything that they did a significant amount of time ago is the same mentality as Karen who lives in a white middle class neighborhood calling the cops because she sees a black man walking down the street. She isnâ€™t thinking about â€œmaybe he lives hereâ€ â€œmaybe heâ€™s just going for a walkâ€, she immediately jumps to â€œHES CASING MY HOUSE AND SCARING MY BAAAABIIESSSSSSâ€. Just like how cancel culture doesnâ€™t stop and think â€œhey 10 or 5 or 15 years is a really bong time, maybe people change, maybe slew shouldnâ€™t hold him responsible for something he said when he was 20â€, they jump straight to â€œonce a dickhead always a dickheadâ€. I mean for fucks sake there are people who were neo-Nazi skinheads that become strong, outspoken advocates of racial equality. People change.
