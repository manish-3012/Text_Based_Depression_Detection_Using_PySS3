Ok I have some bad news ... I have the common cold I woke up last morning and had a raging headache and my nosed was super blocked and was running a lot. I tried to reach for tissues and blew my nose but it doesn't help and it continued for the whole day with me going through a box of tissues and not wanting to get out of bed. Luckily I had my dog as company and watched Netflix with him. I'm getting better now but I still be sneeting. 

(P.s my dog is called louie ... he good boi)
