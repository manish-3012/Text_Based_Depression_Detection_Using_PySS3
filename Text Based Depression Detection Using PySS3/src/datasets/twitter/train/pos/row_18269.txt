I know this sub gets blown up with these but HOLY SHIT I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND! I asked her out December 18th and she decided 2 days ago (I know long time but we were really good friends who had crushes on eachother)she was holding out until my Birthday (6 days from now) but she couldn't hold it in. AND NOW I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND WOO! It's like 1:00 AM so we're both dead inside but excited at the same time. Good times Good times. woooo!!
