serious post about my mental health problems bit of background it started when i was 3 my dad mentally abused me, and him and my brother beat the shit out of each other all the time so i saw that a lot so that obviously fucked me up seeing that so young, my dad mentally abused me he took my things and sold them and kept the money, he did so much more but thereâ€™s to much to say and it fucked me up so much itâ€™s so hard for me to trust someone. right so at this moment iâ€™m 17 tried to kill myself three times iâ€™m prescribed lorazepam and zoplicone and iâ€™m in the uk so if your from the uk and have mental health problems they rarely ever give you them so iâ€™m in a horrible place right now, iâ€™m not close with anyone i donâ€™t have any friends the only person i like is my mum but iâ€™m beginning to bring her down with having to deal with me so sheâ€™s getting depressed itâ€™s a lot of pressure for me while i have already got a war zone  in my brain. iâ€™m thinking of running away for a while me and her have been arguing so much recently and i canâ€™t deal with it i really want to jill myself but maybe if i just leave go somewhere and be alone have time to think and she can have some time away from me so maybe she will feel better like maybe go somewhere for a month by myself but i donâ€™t want to be in this house i want to leave or iâ€™ll kill myself it hurts so much but i have no money to get by no place to go so iâ€™d basically be homeless, i just need advice be honest but please donâ€™t bully me iâ€™m in the worst place i have ever been in my life ever iâ€™m thinking of packing a bag and leaving next week
just feedback please what should i do iâ€™m scared . (iâ€™m on the lorazepam and zoplicone now so if some bits donâ€™t make sense sorry iâ€™m a bit zoned out)
