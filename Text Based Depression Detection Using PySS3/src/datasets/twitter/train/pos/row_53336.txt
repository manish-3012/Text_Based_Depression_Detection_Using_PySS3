How long before my friend acknowledges my existence [https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8tooz/help\_its\_confirmed\_that\_my\_friend\_figured\_out\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8tooz/help_its_confirmed_that_my_friend_figured_out_i/) Last post. Basically I led my friend on and she realized that I like her. Now she's kind of upset and isn't responding to my texts at all and I had to get my friend to talk to her to get any info out. How long do you think before she'll talk to me? Man frick my life.
