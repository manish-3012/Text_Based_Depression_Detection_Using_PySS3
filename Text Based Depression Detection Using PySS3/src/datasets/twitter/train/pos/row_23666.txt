My mom got mad at me today. She caught me doing my homework at 9 which she yelled was not the time to be doing homework and that i should have done in earlier. Heres the kicker i was at a karate belt ceremony the while day so i had no time to do the home work. For more info this happened on a sunday. Please give me advice to try and talk to my mom about this.
