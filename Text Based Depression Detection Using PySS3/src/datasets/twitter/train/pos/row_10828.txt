Is it weird and awkward wearing gaming headphones with a mic in like a bus or a public place? I downloaded like 2+GB of music I want to listen to while traveling, and the only headphones that I have are my 27$ Scorpion *blablabla* gaming headphones. I want to know the answer to my question, otherwise I'm gonna have to get normal headphones because I don't like wearing those earbuds.
