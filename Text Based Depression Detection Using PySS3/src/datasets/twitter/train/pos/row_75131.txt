Heyo i ve got a question for all of my fellow teenagers So a friend of mine apparently saw a black rug some company was trying to sell to kids as a "teleporter" apparently you were able to put toys on it and it would "teleport" your toys into it like a storage thing and you could move it around. Idk honestly I think they are crazy but I need help figuring it out if this thing was real or not.  It may have been introduced in the 2010's.  Again idk I honestly think my friend is Crazy.


Edit: She said black fabric not rug.
Edit 2: said wierd friend is in comments down below under the name kkaitlyncookk better description there
