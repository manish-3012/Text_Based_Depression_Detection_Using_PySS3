I thought racism wasnâ€™t a thing in America and now Iâ€™m disappointed Iâ€™m from Eastern Europe and I always thought it was like the only racist place on earth and the rest of the world is nice and accepting. I saw those movies with people of all colours and just assumed everyone was living in peace and racism simply doesnâ€™t exist in the USA. Iâ€™m very disappointed right now :///
