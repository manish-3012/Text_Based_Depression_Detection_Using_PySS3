I don't know who I am sometimes and I'm so sick and tired of it I'm an Indian American girl. It's just who I am. I grew up in America, as an American girl. And with that I've had so many identity issues. My whole life, I've internalized that I'm bad for it, and that people don't like me because of it. Because of all the stereotypes I've seen, and all the judging looks, and pressure and all the ways people like us have been represented in the media. We don't realize it, but our brains are literally built in a way where we see someone and immediately make assumptions about them. It's just a biological function and can't be helped sometimes. And I've fallen victim to it. I've internalized it so much that I don't know who I am sometimes. There are actual moment's where I think about myself, and realize, "oh wait, that's me". I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of hating myself to the point where I don't even know who I am. I can't be the only one. And the thing is, I feel so guilty about it, because Indian Americans are generally more well off compared to other immigrant ethnicities. But I can't keep doing this to myself. This cycle of identity crises and guilt. I feel so scared to just wear what I want to wear because I know I'll be judged. And I know I just need confidence, and sometimes I have it, but sometimes I'm just so tired. I want this to end. 

Forgive me if this seems a little ranty or it seems like I'm trying to victimize myself, I just wanted to let it out and be myself. I'm just so fucking tired and kinda having a breakdown right now. Please tell me I'm not the only one.
