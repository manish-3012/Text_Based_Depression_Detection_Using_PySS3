Would I be jumping the gun if I asked her out? There is this one girl I'm now head over heels for and we get along super well. We can just talk for hours, and it's very clear she likes me. I have been on dates before but never met anyone like her. I know she'd say yes, but I really want for the relationship to last. Keep in mind it's my freshman year in an entirely new state. Do you think asking now would make it less likely of staying together?
