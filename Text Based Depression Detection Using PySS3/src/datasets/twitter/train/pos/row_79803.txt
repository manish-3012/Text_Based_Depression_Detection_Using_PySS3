Does anyone else kinda suck at tying their shoes? Like obviously I know how to tie and untie my shoes, but I wasnâ€™t really solid with it until I was like 14. 

I think itâ€™s because I had the option of Velcro or slip on shoes for so long. I also had my phase of wearing only Crocs for a few years as a child. 

I also have at least one friend who had a similar issues. 

Maybe Iâ€™m just weird, I have a valid reason for it, but still.
