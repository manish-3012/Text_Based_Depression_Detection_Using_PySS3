Is it weird for someone our age to like marbles and dominos? I've always been into marbles and dominos, but never had them as a kid. Now, I have the chance to get some but I feel sorta self-conscious about it all. Iâ€™m known for displaying a relatively sophisticated and mature sense of self. So, Iâ€™m just afraid that people might stop taking me seriously because I like things that are considered childish. Whatâ€™s your take on the matter? Would a teenager having such possessions strike you as strange?

*Note: Iâ€™d rather you tell me youâ€™d consider it off than lie. Lying isnâ€™t answering my question, in fact, itâ€™s a waste of my time. Just donâ€™t worry about sparing anyoneâ€™s feelings.
