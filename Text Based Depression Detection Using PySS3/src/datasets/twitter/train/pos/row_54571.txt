Dear terrible math teacher and math supervisor... "get a tutor" is not an answer to MY MATH TEACHER NOT TEACHING IN CLASS. You can't just leave out HALF the lesson, never tell us that we didn't cover it, and then expect US TO KNOW It.

Also to my math teacher, stop giving me 45 minutes to complete some super LONG TEST. And no "Racism isn't a textbook problem" isn't a reason to not give me ENOUGH TIME.

But hey, keep doing what you're doing and blaming the students for having D's on tests. If everyone is literally failing your class, maybe you're the problem.
