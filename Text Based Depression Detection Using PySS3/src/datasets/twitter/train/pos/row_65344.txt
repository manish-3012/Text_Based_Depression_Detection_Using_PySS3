First date Hey there fellas, im a 17 year old welsh guy who has never asked anyone out or been asked out. Yesterday i asked a girl  i liked out and she accepted which really made my 'anxiety' about relationships get a bit better. Atm we seem to have a date planned for the 18th of this month. Could u guys give me some advice on first impressions im really quite an awkward person and i dont want to appear a 'weirdo'. Really just any advice would be really sick. (We both have never been in a relationship btw). 

Im gonna delete this post after 24 hours because im really just uncomfortable on this topic and its kinda embarissing
