Is it weird to have a best friend of the opposite gender? I feel kind of weird having a best friend that is a girl. I mean especially recently. A few months ago we only hung out once. And now itâ€™s been 3 or 4 this month alone. Theyâ€™re nice, I mean she comes to me with her relationship problems Andi go to her for my emotional problems. We love each otherâ€™s friendships so much. 

I just think itâ€™s weird how close her and I are to eachother without really having crushes on eachother
