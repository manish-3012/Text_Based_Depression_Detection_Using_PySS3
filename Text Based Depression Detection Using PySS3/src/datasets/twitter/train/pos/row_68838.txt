i just realized about an hour ago you can inhale with your mouth open so i was thinking about how everyone always tells you to inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth, and i was trying to inhale with my mouth open, and i was just sucking in air with my mouth. so apparently if you touch the base of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you can't inhale through your mouth and it transfers to your mouth. conveniency 100
