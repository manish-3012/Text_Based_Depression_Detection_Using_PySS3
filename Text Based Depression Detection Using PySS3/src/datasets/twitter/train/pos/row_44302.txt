Let's destroy r/indianpeoplefacebook I've been fighting anti-Indian racism on that sub since joining Reddit but we'll need all hands on deck to have it fully removed from the website.

I'm asking all self-respecting, confident Indians, brown-skinned people and anti-racist allies to help me in fighting the rampant racism on that bigoted sub. Those of you who are tired of the harmful stereotyping, targeted harassment and perpetuation of hatred created by r/indianpeoplefacebook, please, DO NOT STAY SILENT.

Make noise, show them they're wrong. Join me and we can fight racism in this corner of the internet. It's not okay and I know you're all sick of it. Do not give them an inch. No racist action, big or small is remotely acceptable.

Remember not to harass but to educate firmly and make your disapproval known. That sub is supposed to be about us, it needs our approval to be credible. Shift the tides of our louder, self-loathing siblings encouraging the racism against their own. We can make their opinions the unpopular ones on that sub.

Enough is enough. Now is the time for action. Now is the time to express disapproval with loudness and frequency. You are not alone.
