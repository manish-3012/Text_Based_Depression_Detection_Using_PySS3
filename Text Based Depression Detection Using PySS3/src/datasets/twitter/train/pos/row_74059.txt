Todayâ€™s my 20th birthday. All I have to say is that time moves fast. I feel like I have just started high school and now my life is probably just now starting. Some advice is this... Donâ€™t take jokes seriously. Be able to laugh at what makes you happy. No matter what. Getting a girlfriend in high school really doesnâ€™t matter, but if you do... Good for you. Grades in high school really donâ€™t matter in the real world. Unless you are going to college right out of the gate. And if you donâ€™t know what you want todo right after high school, everything will be ok. Take a gap year and explore your interests. Well after the pandemics over of course. Find what makes you happy. Get a job and save as much money as you can. You will thank me later. Itâ€™s been one hell of a journey. I canâ€™t wait for it to continue. Stay safe everyone and remember. Have fun.
