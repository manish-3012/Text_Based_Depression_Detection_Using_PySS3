Follow Up: To all those who suggested I talk about mental health on my podcast.  This is a follow-up post from my original: [What do you wish was talked about more when it comes to teens?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j21bo6/what_do_you_wish_was_talked_about_more_when_it/)  

Thank you for the Idea, my friends and I recorded the episode and it was great! We interviewed Dr. Mary Alvord, and she was great. So thank you all!
