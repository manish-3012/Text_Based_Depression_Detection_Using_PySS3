Iâ€™m looking for friends I wrote a bunch about me if your interested Yo Iâ€™m 15 m Iâ€™m kinda lonely and shit yada yada but I wanna meet some friends I guess

My interests include video games of all types preferably with a a good story and Iâ€™m always looking for someone to play smash with I play basketball and stuff Iâ€™m pretty tall and I like art but Iâ€™m not good at it at all

Hereâ€™s some looks things Iâ€™m 6,4 15 years old live in Canada (Alberta) Iâ€™m single (just kidding but actually Iâ€™m kinda not) I have brown hair brown eyes and Iâ€™m pretty buff if you could say that idk but this has been the awkward section over two you more awkward personality section

Thanks Todd (my names not Todd itâ€™s Jesse) well people tell me Iâ€™m a kind person but Iâ€™m also a little bit sad a lot itâ€™s not bad but I feel down a lot and lose motivation so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m looking for people to talk and vent to maybe play a game Iâ€™m also kind of childish I guess I like marvel and lego still and I read games a lot and am so hyped for Steve to be in smash so yea thereâ€™s that Iâ€™m also pretty funny idk if youâ€™d vibe with my sense of humour or not but still also Iâ€™m smart but suck at math and am socially awkward Iâ€™ve never talked to a girl and really hit it off or anything but still I think thatâ€™s cool I guess.

Anyway thanks for reading if you did and I hope I can make a friend or two Iâ€™d love to have anyone talk to me lol anyway bye
