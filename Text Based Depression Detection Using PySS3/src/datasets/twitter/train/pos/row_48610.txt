Help I need opinions So around a year ago I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. But Ive been thinking its more than that. Since quarantine started ive had more time to myself. Making me notice more about me and the way I cope. 
So I looked into more things that this could be because Ive been struggling. Some people say it might be trauma from the constant fighting among my household. Some also tell me I heavily imply ADHD. And I wanted to know if anyone has any ideas so I can get help. 

Ive been having a hard time finding motivation to clean my room or schooling area. So Im in like a mountain of random shit

Ive havenâ€™t been able to pay attention. At all. Like I tried to go to bed an hour ago. And ended up writing â€œI sold my soul to Gundham tanaka 16 days ago in exchange for my hair,Feet,math skills, and half my life spanâ€ on my arm

Ive been ticing a lot. Like one is going â€œGUNDHAM TANAKAâ€ in random. Or just slapping myself

I fidget a lot and with whatever I can find. and chew on random shit 

And Ive been crying over nothing. Like yesterday I couldnt find my blanket and curled up on my floor and cried, then just got up and went to bed like nothing happened.

In no way am I saying â€œI HAVE ___â€ just seeing if anyone could help. Because It could also be  just anxiety. But ive just been having a hard time and This has been on my mind for awhile. And If anyone would have anything that could help, I could try to get help. I am a girl so stuff might be different for males but If yall have any help, itâ€™s appreciated! &lt;\3
