If youâ€™re feeling down Think of the Earth like a beach, think of the grains like humans. One grain is not a beach, you need a lot of grains together to make beach. This is like humans, you need humans there to support you and help you because you canâ€™t do everything on your own. Me and so many people are here to support you so donâ€™t hesitate to message me or comment if you are going through a tough time and Iâ€™ll talk to you
