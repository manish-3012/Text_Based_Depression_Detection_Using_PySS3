I need an Advice. For almost 1.5 year I can't do anything, feeling just sad and worthless. Can't even do a easy task like taking out trash because I don't have energy. For now  I can live with it but when the pandemic slows down and I'm gonna need to school (17yo) it will overwhelm me and I can do something bad...
To the point of the post: How can I tell my parents that I need to see doctor for this? They know there's something wrong with me but I'm scared that they'll think I'm joking and move on.
