What I hate about my brain So, about 3 weeks ago I got asked out, i said yes, all that fun stuff. She has a weird tech rule in her house. So I cant text her often. (Last we talked was about two weeks ago)

But why I'm here writing this now. Is a) the fact it appears both accounts of mine are blocked (my hope is she did it so her dad won't find out), and b) the weird amount of stress from not seeing her that I have. 

A) her dads a drunkard and her oldest sister still lives with her at the age 19-20, severely limiting her and the fact shes the one that does the most work in her house.

B) since I saw/spoke to her last, my brain has been flooded with negative hypotheticals and what if's, (because of trauma from previous relationships). And to be honest it's been hell on earth, especially when you check back on their account to see if you can text them, you see their account changed dramatically.

But I digress, a whole lotta abandonment issues, clinginess, and first world problems. Will I still move forth? Yes. Will it be a struggle not talking to them for so long? Also yes. 

Thank you for reading if you did.
