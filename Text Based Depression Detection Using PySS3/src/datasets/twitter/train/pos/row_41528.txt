iâ€™m sad now Man, i was playing one of my favorite games and this dude on xbox looking for group said that he was giving away free stuff. He then said to message him FA double G. I started getting wary of him then, but still sent it like an idiot. Now he reported it and iâ€™m suspended on xbox for a day. Why do people have to be so mean? Iâ€™ve been suspended before so now iâ€™m scared that i might get banned. Feels bad man.
