Ayo Iâ€™m 5â€™9â€ (175 cm) and 110 lbs (49 kg) Iâ€™m skinny as fuck and I donâ€™t know what to do about it. I eat a shit ton of food everyday all kinds of proteins and carbs I work out a decent amount too I even have fucking abs but my BMI still says Iâ€™m severely underweight (15.8 BMI) this is fucking ridiculous
