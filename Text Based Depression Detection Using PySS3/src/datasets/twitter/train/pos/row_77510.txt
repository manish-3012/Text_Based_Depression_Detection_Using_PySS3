Anyone wanna chat? Dmmmm me :))))) TheÂ garden strawberryÂ (or simplyÂ strawberry;Â Fragaria Ã— ananassa)[1]Â is a widely grownÂ hybrid speciesÂ of the genusÂ Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for theirÂ fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods asÂ jam,Â juice,Â pies,Â ice cream,Â milkshakes, andÂ chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap,Â lip gloss, perfume, and many others.
