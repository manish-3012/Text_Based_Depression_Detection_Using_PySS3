Why is it so hard to find a wholesome relationship? Sex and all that is cool but honestly, it doesnâ€™t really matter too much to me. Iâ€™d much rather have somebody love me and care for me than have someone there just for physical stuff. I would give anything to have that. It seems like I have so much love to give and no one to give it to yk?
