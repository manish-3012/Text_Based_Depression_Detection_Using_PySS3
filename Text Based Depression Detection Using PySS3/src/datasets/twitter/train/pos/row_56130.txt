Listen man Guys,I know this year sucks and Christmas does as well. Just stay inside, now is not the time. I know some know this but some want to rebel and become a dumbass. Listen, I'm sorry you can't see nobody this year. I want to be with my family,but can't due to this virus. I hope this year is at least a bit good for y'all. Stay safe and happy holidays.
