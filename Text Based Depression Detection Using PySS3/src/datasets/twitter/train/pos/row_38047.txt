Big confusion So I am a 16 year old male, and I donâ€™t really feel like genuinely attracted to anyone. I see both guys and girls as potential partners but Iâ€™m not sure what the fuck my own sexuality is anymore. 

This might sound a bit too personal but when I do the dirty solo, Iâ€™ve imagined it with both genders, but at the same time when I meet with actual people who look fine or people I know well, I donâ€™t feel a sense of literal attraction.

I dunno, I just want an answer from literally anybody online because I can remain anonymous. I would never ask this shit to my school counselor or my parents. A taboo like this in my mind isnâ€™t an issue but it can certainly be with other people, and I donâ€™t need that kinda stress on top of figuring out all these mixed emotions.
