How is school going for you guys? I'm normally a pretty go with the flow type of person but, this year has been hard with virtual learning. I'm an American so part of are culture is socialization. Not to mention online Chemistry is extremely difficult especially with a stubborn teacher old. I'm losing steam fast with this shit.  I've never been more depressed that this year and I went through middle school as a fat nerd. I'm not normally depressed, hell I loved my first year of high school. I'm just done and I'm barely half way through.
