Calling women dishwashers is disrespectful and I'm tired of hearing it They're so much more than dishwashers! They also cook, clean the house, do laundry, raise babies, and give the sex! (I should know, I have sexed many womens)

Personally I'd prefer you guys use the term "fully automated maid" robot instead, it's alot more descriptive and really gives them the credit they deserve
