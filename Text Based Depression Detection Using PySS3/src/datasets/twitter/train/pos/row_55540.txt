This was on the note of my rose for valentines day â€œDear ***** we know you have a hard time at school and u keep it to yourself, we hope we can cheer you up with thisâ¤ï¸â€

This was on the rose I received today, people could mail their teachers who they wanted to send a rose to.

I dont think someone did it, no way it are people from my class.

I do appreciate it, but i kinda wished it was from this girl. I know its not from her no way.
