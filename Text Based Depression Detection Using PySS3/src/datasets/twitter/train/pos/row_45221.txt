Can I get some game recommendations for PS4? In return I will also give you game recommendations, here you go:

***Hollow Knight -*** Hollow Knight deserves so much love and praise. It's an indie Metroidvania where you play as a cute little bug thing *that has the power to kill literal gods.* You spend the game exploring Hallownest, an ancient, ruined civilization where most of the inhabitants are long-dead, killed by a mysterious infection. The controls in this game are smoother than butter that's been microwaved for 10 seconds, and the combat is extremely satisfying. It's the only game that makes me feel genuinely excited to get demolished in a boss fight.

***Monster Hunter -*** Take one look at the name and take a wild guess what this game is about. Yep! Take your weapon of choice and use it to beat hundreds of cool-looking monsters into a pulp so you can take their dead body and turn it into better weapons and armor to pulverize even bigger, stronger, cooler monsters. Jokes aside tho, Monster Hunter is fun as hell, and GOD is it satisfying when you learn a monster's moveset and then absolutely destroy it. Also, there's a ton of different weapon types to play around with.

***Stardew Valley -*** Time wasting simulator where you take care of a farm, sell things to make insane profits, fight monsters in the local abandoned mine, and date like half the townspeople. It's fun :)

***Genshin Impact -*** It says it's free to play, but it will destroy your non-existent wallet. It's a strange combination of "gacha game" and "anime Breath of the Wild" that ends up creating a genuinely good game with fun combat and a surprisingly competent main story. ^(This game has no reason being this fun I swear to god.)
