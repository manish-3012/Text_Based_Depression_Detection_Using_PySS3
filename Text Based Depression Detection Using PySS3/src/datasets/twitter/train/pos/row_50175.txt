I have 0 fucking inspiration rn Everything fucking sucks. Iâ€™m just sad or scared all the time and itâ€™s exhausting. I miss songwriting everyday but now Iâ€™m so drained. I canâ€™t write shit. I used to write everyday, but now like once every four days now and I canâ€™t stand it. I try but it just makes me sad cuz itâ€™s always uninspired trash. I canâ€™t even get good sleep either. I always go to sleep late cuz it takes so long to go to sleep itâ€™s not worth it so I just wait til I get so tired I pass out. And I wake up  every night cuz of nightmares. Iâ€™m so fucking tired all the time. And I have so many panic attacks that have just been getting worse and more frequent so now Iâ€™m trying to work up the courage to speak up about it. My mom is worried cuz she can tell thereâ€™s something wrong and asks if Iâ€™m ok like 5 times today. I donâ€™t talk to friends anymore because Iâ€™m just gonna bring them down. Everything I love is just being fucking ruined. I canâ€™t take this shit. I swear to god if I didnâ€™t have dogs then I wouldâ€™ve killed myself so long ago. Goddamnit dude life fucking sucks. I swear to god if anyone replies with â€œit gets betterâ€ Iâ€™m gonna fucking flip. Iâ€™m tired of people saying that. Hope is worthless. Every time Iâ€™ve had hope of shit getting better it always ends up worse.
