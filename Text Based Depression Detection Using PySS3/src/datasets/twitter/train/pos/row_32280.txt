Tell me a story that happened to you! I want to hear a story about you, whether itâ€™s your favorite memory, a fun story from your childhood, whatever! Donâ€™t be gross though please lmao. Iâ€™ll start...
When I was 12 my grandma gave me my favorite book, The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton. I fell in love with the book, and connected so well with Ponyboyâ€™s character, but also Dallyâ€™s honestly. And when she passed away when I was 14, that book is probably one of my most treasured possessions, cuz she helped me find my favorite book in the whole world :)
I canâ€™t wait to read your stories!! And thank you for your time
