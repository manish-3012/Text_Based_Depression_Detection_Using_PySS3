What does this mean. I know how to do my schoolwork and itâ€™s sitting right in front of me. I want to get it done and this sounds crazy but my mind gets so overwhelmed and I almost cry whenever I look at it. Iâ€™ve missed so many assignments because I just canâ€™t do them and I donâ€™t care for them. My parents only show affection towards my brother and I feel like thereâ€™s nothing left to lose by skipping these assignments. Someone told me this was adhd but I donâ€™t know and I know this isnâ€™t normal
