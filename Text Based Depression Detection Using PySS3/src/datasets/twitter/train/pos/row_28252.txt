Wtf is dissociation My girlfriend was talking to me about how she's able to "dissociate". Where she'd "zone out" and then "wake up" downstairs, doing some task, with no recollection of how she got there. She even said shes even done it for 2 and a half days, she had gone to school, taken notes and completed homework, "waking up" 2 days later with no recollection of any of it. Personally this completley blows my mind and I was just wondering if anyone else knew about this/has experienced it?
