getting motivation to complete my assignments and study so i am having exams in 1 month and i have no motivation to either study or complete assignments(i am quite fucked).the reason is that my school rejected me from taking computer subject as option even after getting 100/100.the management said "i doubt you will pass in computers so i am removing you from the list". People who got worse marks than me are having chance to take computers. This is just making me sad and want to quit even trying to studying. The feeling that everyone can do better than me is stuck with me.i don't know what to do anymore
