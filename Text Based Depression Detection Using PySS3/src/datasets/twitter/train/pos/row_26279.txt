Why do feminists living in the US call themselves oppressed? And most of them are cisgender white women. Being alive in today's society sucks. But it's not just for women. At least not in the US, I know there are countries. But that doesn't happen here. I mean, there are white cisgender middle class women living in the US calling themselves "oppressed" Whether they  face more discrimination is up to you, but it is not oppression!! Not in the west!! I know I'll get a lot of controversy, but I once saw something that said "Being born a woman is a tragedy." Okay, it's a lot worse in countries other than the US. But if you're talking about society, being born a woman is not a tragedy!! Not in the US!!
