Canâ€™t wait till I have a job... Iâ€™m so done with studying and doing homework 24/7. Literally Iâ€™m so jealous of my parents and older brother, even if they work hard, once their done, their done... they go to bed at 9:00p.m. and I go to bed at 5:00 a.m. ... the schooling system is garbage, plus with this pandemic going on and everything teachers think itâ€™s okay to gives us even more shÂ¡ t to do because we are at home all day.
