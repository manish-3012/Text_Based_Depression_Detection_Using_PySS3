i think i passed my prime i feel like a old divorced aunt who drinks wine and rants about men. which is ironic since i have no experience with mutual love, at all.

 i noticed that im not getting any boys or bitches, and no one seems attracted to me anymore (atleast i think so). have i passed my prime?
