People dont understand what the fuck dark humor is If I said I'm gonna kill a jew, that's not dark humor but that also doesn't mean I'm gonna actually kill a fucking jew, if I say I'm gonna kill a jew in a clever way, that's dark humor. With dark humor everything is on the table, murder, abortion, national tragedy, assault, racism etc. Dark humor is supposed to be terrible, it doesn't mean anything. Idgaf if people disagree, that's what people do. So Jessica, before you type some shit like "Wait, people think this i-" shut the hell up.
