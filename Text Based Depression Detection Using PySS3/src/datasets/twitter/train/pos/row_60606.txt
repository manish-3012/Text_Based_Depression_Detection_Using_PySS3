I don't know if this is a good idea or not. Where I am right now, I cannot have a friendship with a woman. I want to though. I don't want to limit myself to only being friends with guys. But because of my downright obsession with finding a girlfriend I can't just talk to women like I can men. I get in my own head about them. So the question was, how can I change that? 

I'm going to essentially brainwash myself into thinking no woman will ever love me. Completely loose all romantic and sexual attraction to women. If I don't have those barriers, I can freely talk to them. When I think about it though, it just kinda seems wrong, but I can't put my finger on exactly why.
