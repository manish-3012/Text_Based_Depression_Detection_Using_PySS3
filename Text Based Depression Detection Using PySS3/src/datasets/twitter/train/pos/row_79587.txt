I just donâ€™t know where to go from here So Iâ€™ve been texting this girl for the past few weeks and weâ€™ve both fallen for each other. The problem is that we canâ€™t seem to establish a relationship. We both know we like each other but she doesnâ€™t want a relationship right now because she doesnâ€™t want to hurt me if it doesnâ€™t work out. I told her it was ok and I understood her decision and all that and she even decided to start a relationship... just to immediately back out of it because of that fear again.

My question is this: Should I confront her about this fear and try to reassure her, or should I just let it go? I really like her and I know she likes me a lot too, I just donâ€™t know how to get past this without seeming pushy or selfish.
