Dating apps - a lot of girls have it during hs. And after hs around 75-80% of women have dating apps installed on they phone. They be getting 50 a day EASY. 

Too many options also blows their heads up tho. You can consistently see women that are average or below average rate themselves a 9 or 10. It gives them an unrealistic perception of themselves.

Then they will go out into the real world after hs thinking their a 9 but theyâ€™re actually a 4 and they bring nothing to the table
