We should have a suicide flair, a priority one. I had just commented on a post that was titled "I wanna kill myself". I told him/her that he could talk to me to vent and that, obviously, don't suicide. And when I had refreshed it, the post and account was deleted.

Now I hate to think what seems as the obvious scenario here. Even if nothing really happened, it's important this community stands out for those who seek help. Like, that should be the top priority.
