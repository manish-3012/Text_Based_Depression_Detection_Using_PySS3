Entitlement and narcissism has overtaken America In 2016 liberals screamed "not my president" and it is hilarious seeing so called "conservatives" yell the same thing in 2020.

America has become a nation of entitled narcissists.

How can this nation be the light in a dark world again? How can America led the free world against the Communist Chinese genocide of the Uyghurs? How can they led humanity into space again?
