Itâ€™s so odd when people on reddit say theyâ€™re a certain age, but then their post history shows them stating theyâ€™re a different age?? Theyâ€™ll say, for example, theyâ€™re 20, you check their post history &amp; suddenly an hour ago they were 19, then no, they were 20 10 hours ago when they posted something else 

Whatâ€™s the point ???
