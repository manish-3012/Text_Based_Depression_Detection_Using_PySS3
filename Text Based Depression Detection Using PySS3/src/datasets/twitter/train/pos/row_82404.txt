Number Game? Sorry to add onto the shitposts in new, but I really like chatting so maybe we could play the number game. 13f by the way, and please don't be over the age of 15. 

We could also play [chess.com](https://chess.com) or among us or [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io) if you don't feel like playing the number game.
