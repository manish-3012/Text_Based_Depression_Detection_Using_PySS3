Is this school memory relatable? I just wanted to see if this memory I had is relatable to any of you, Back in elementary school around 2008 I was a little bit of the class quiet child, meaning I didn't like contact of any form And would keep to myself, but the main part is class assignments. I'd use to be terrible at math, algebra, etc, And my only favorite things in school were sitting alone in a corner with a book in the library and reading And in the cafeteria, I always felt safe being away from big crowds because it messed with my anxiety, I'd used to hide on the running track with a book i could take home for the week, and I'd just sit there and people-gaze, The other thing I enjoyed was staring out the window while it was storming, i always loved bad weather and staring outside just made me comfortable. All this being said, is this by any means relatable? And what are Or were your favorite things in school Pre-covid?
