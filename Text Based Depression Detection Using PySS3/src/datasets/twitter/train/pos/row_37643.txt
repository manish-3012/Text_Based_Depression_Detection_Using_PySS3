Is it wrong for a 17 year old and 14 year old to talk? So I have a friend that's talking to a 14 year old and they were friends. He didn't ask for nudes or pics but he got feelings and the girl didn't like that so she told him and he agreed they shouldn't date.

Her older sister starts texting him calling him a creep, desperate, etc etc

He didn't know her age till later on. 

Now for me, I don't think this is wrong. 3 years is nothing. When I was 17 I was still immature and knew 14 year olds that I got along with
