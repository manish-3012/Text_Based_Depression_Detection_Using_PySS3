Am I the only one who feels this way? I spend so much time looking at my flaws and other people's flaws. I've had multiple opportunities to get into a relationship and I shoot down every idea of it because my mind makes a big deal out of little things. (Ex. I hate how my hair looks when it gets wet, I personally think that that would ruin a relationship)

What the hell is wrong with me.......
