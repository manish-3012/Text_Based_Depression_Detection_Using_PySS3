Guess Iâ€™m allergic to propylene glycol Iâ€™ve been using different kind of deodorant â€˜cause it works so much better and I just,, ignored the allergic reaction??

Until the skin started peeling off. Whoops.

Back to regular deodorant I guess.

(Context: I know itâ€™s the propylene glycol by comparing the common allergic reaction causes and two pairs of deodorant I had, one without and one with)
