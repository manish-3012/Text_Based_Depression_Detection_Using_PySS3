My teacher hate me Ok. We all probably has that one teacher that is for some reason hating you. But my Spanish teacher took it to the next level. It started while one of my friends was having a presentation and needed to go to the toilet. When I asked him the question he looked me right in the eyes and said "Why didn't you go while we hade lunch". When he hade stop to talk my friend continued with his presentation. Just 20 seconds later he looked at me and said "can you stop blinking. I can't hear the presentation". Like what the F. How can you blink so someone can't HEAR. Plzz can someone explain.
