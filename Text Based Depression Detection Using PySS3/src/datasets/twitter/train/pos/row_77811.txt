Whatâ€™s happening? So about an entire YEAR ago my friends and I all got these creepy texts from random numbers basically telling us to do the blue whale challenge, when we talked about it through and Instagram call we got a text saying â€œweâ€™re listeningâ€ which really confused me because I thought iphone mics were nearly impossible to hack, eventually the number stopped.

Now today, almost a year later, me and my friend were taking about random shit and the conversation got back to when that happened, and I fucking kid you not, we both got texts from a random number saying â€œweâ€™re backðŸ¤¡â€ and â€œweâ€™re coming for youðŸ¤¡â€ as soon as we started talking about it, my friend even got his address sent to him, same thing that happened last time. I even got screenshots.

Iâ€™m not as scared this time more than I am confused, is my friend fucking with me or is this like the best hacker to ever live?
