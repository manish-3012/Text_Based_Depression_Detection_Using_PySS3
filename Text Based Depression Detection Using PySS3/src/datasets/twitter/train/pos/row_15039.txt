my boyfriend broke up with me but... iâ€™m honestly not that sad about it? Iâ€™ve posted about this before, but itâ€™s day 2 now and I honestly donâ€™t feel that sad. Iâ€™ve been distracting myself and have been talking to my friends, and I honestly donâ€™t feel that upset. 

but apparently he broke up with me because of an accumulation of problems which he doesnâ€™t want to tell me about... but oh well. 

anyway, i just thought Iâ€™d update you guys. I hope things get better and other guys will actually like me ðŸ˜€
