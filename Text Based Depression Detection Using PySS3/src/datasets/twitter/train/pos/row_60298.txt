A massive wildfire is near my hometown and coming towards it The next town over has suffered enough damage that idk if itll be salvageable. I've lived on the same block my entire life and I wasnt gonna leave for awhile, I dont know what would happen if we lost it all. All I want is for people to realize how careful they need to be when it comes to fire season. Thousands of people have lost everything in an hour and thousands more to come will too. Please, for the love of everything, dont be stupid and start fires during a fire ban, they're banned for a reason.
