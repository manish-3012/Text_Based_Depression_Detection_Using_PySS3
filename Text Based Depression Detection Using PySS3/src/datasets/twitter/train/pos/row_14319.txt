i feel like one of my friends is deteriorating i miss him

he used to love me, i miss that

i miss when we loved eachother

and i miss him being worried about me, and excited to talk to me, and i remember when he made an alt account to hide how much he still loved me

and i miss how nice he was

he changed so much and hes just gotten so more antisocial 

i used to be the antisocial one, now he is

we basically switched places

i still care about him so fucking much :(
