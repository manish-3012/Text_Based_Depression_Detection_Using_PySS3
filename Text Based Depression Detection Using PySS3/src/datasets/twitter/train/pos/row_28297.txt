Why does my brothers room smell like feet Whenever I go into my brothers room, it reeks of feet. Itâ€™s really weird because when I ask why it smells so much he insists that itâ€™s nothing and Iâ€™m just imagining it. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s just oder and my brother needs to shower or if heâ€™s doing something funky in there but itâ€™s throwing me off because it didnâ€™t use to smell like this. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a teenage boy thing or what but If anyone had any idea what it could be, please explain! Thank you.
