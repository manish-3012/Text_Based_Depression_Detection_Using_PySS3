A dream I had about 2 years ago Okay so there was this math club called the Auntie Club (auntie is pronounced â€œant-ee,â€ this is important for later in the dream). I donâ€™t know why it was called the Auntie Club, donâ€™t question it.

There was another club that was for some reason very against the Auntie Club. This club was then named the Anti-Auntie Club. 

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
