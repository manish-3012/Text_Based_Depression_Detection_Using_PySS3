I'm not sure I really rocked him or not. So back in middle school there was this bitch ass nigga. I was walking from class and he smacked me in the back of the head and tried to run away. 

I dropped my stuff and caught him before he could even take 3 full strides. I grabbed him bybthe collar and went to punch him in the face. And pushed him away.

I picked up my stuff and starting back walking with my lady friend. I never looked back. My adrenaline was fucking rushing. I get why hood niggas fight all the time.

Later I saw him in the office crying. A day or two later some kid was asking me if I beat if ass. And to be real honest, I'm not sure if I did. I never got in trouble and nobody even talked to me about it.

I'm not sure if I really punched him in the face or not. That's probably the only time I've ever gotten close to blacking out in anger.

Now it's just a story I tell to the ladies and I tell them I actually rocked him.
