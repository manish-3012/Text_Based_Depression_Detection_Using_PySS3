holy shit idk if this is depression or just sadness but it sucks so much lemme give context. school started to base classes off of student performance. basically the US grading system but its ranked and youre in a class from a to f. if you did good in the exam then an a-c is garuanteed but if its shit like me then its an f. 

thing 1: ministry of education said not to divide like this but they wont enforce it so my school is advantageous of the problem. not the exploitation but the fact that i got grouped with people i want to stay away from. i literally changed my class just to get away. 

thing 2: grades. my grades are shit and i wont rise up to an e class till like a month which is still pretty bad but its my hopes

thing 3: groups. since its 8th grade people are grouping up to make friend groups. this started rapidly in 6th grade but took extreme effect in 8. i was affected and also just left out which was the largest contributer. although i do hang out with 3 people on a common/decent occasion its just not enough. 2 of the people are in my class and the other is in b. the 2 in my class just get repetitive and the other one in b is pretty much the only one that is talkable without repetitiveness

yes i still have friends but theyre sooo distanced to the groups

i do estimate some groups are gonna collapse in a few mpnths but nothings stopping from new ones emerging

no, im not suicidal but it sometimes just makes me really depressed
