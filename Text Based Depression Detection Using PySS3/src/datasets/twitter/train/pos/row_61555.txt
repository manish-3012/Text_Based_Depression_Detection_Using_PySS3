Am I positive im not straight anymore So today was kind of a weird day. I realized I actually like girls because long story short, I made out with my best friend who said that she likes me more than just a friend, and I enjoyed it. 
And now that I think of it, I kinda always had diferent crushes on female movie stars but I never realized.
I did my research and turns out I fit in every single stereotype of bi people: I do weird gestures with my hands (the peace sign mostly), I can never sit properly anywhere, I cuff my jeans and I tuck in my shirt, and I love Sweater Weather (I had no idea bi people loved this song)Oh and all my shoes are Vans.
So am I bi? Cause now I think I am.
