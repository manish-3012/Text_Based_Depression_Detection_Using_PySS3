Can't go to work today :( I did a health screening, and the only covid symptom I have is a sore throat. 

That's it, but the screening thing deemed that enough to make me stay out of work.

I work at a school and we do not have the staff for people to be out. 

Really sucks, love my job. And Thursdays are the best days just because all of the chill kids are there.

Anyway, I have to go get tested.
