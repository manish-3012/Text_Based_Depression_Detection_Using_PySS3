Is something wrong with me? So my mom and I were watching some tv and it was late so she was gonna go to bed and as she is getting ready she asks if I'm ok and I say yes, she asks a few more times and I reply yes but after which i start to feel like I'm gonna cry for no reason, but anyway she leaves and after I hear her close her bedroom door I just start crying for no reason, I dont know why I was crying all I know is they were sad tears, so anyway, how is your day going?
