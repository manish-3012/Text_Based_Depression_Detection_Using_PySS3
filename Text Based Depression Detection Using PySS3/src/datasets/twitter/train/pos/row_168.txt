Am I the only one mad about this? Girls be calling each other sexy and hot on each otherâ€™s Instagram. But I remember that time last year where I gave my boy Kenneth a bro hug. Not a loving hug, like one you would give your mom, but just a simple bro hug. If you do not know, a guy hug is when you and the person you are hugging handshake, pull yourselves to each other, and pat the other guys back twice. I did that, and this girl and her group of friends called me and my boy gay. That same girl is the one who calls other girls sexy and hot in the Instagram comments. I cannot be the only one annoyed by this.
