I feel like such a degenerate. I went to bed at 11 pm last night and woke up at 2pm today. Even if I go to sleep early I always wake up mid day. The only reason I woke up today was because my mom came in to see if I was OK. I had 4 alarms set to 7,8,9,10 am and I slept through  all of them. I'm starting to think its a medical disorder or something.
