Here are some of my fav foods/snacks Breakfast burritos with potatoes inside 

Hashbrowns 

Popcorn chicken bowls (mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, cheese, popcorn chicken) 

Ramen (literally any kind. Even the spicy Korean fire noodles. I love noodles.)

French bread (I get so fat eating it but itâ€™s comforting)

Mochi ice cream (it makes me happy) 

Froyo (with cheesecake bites and strawberries) 

My momâ€™s enchiladas are pretty fucking amazing 

I really enjoy the really spicy hot Cheetos or anything spicy in general.

Indian food (spicy chicken tikka masala and basmati rice = MWAH) 

Adobo and rice (my mommy makes it all the time) 

Jambalayaaaaa (enough said. itâ€™s spicy rice with sausages. yum) 

Chocolate pudding (because yes) 

This doesnâ€™t really count but cream cheese. I really love it and I eat it by itself.
