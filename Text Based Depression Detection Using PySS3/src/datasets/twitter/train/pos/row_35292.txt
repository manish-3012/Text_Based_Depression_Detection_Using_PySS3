Why do I have to have the annoying kid in my class Like there's this one kid in school, I'll call 'im George. George is 1)Very Rich, 2)Very self-depreciating, 3)Extremely self-involved, and 4)Literally the epitome of a gay stereotype. Like, his mother is divorced I believe and they've moved a lot, but they're loaded as hell. Which lends itself to being ridiculously self-involved at times, and a bit out of touch. Like, he complained for a month straight to me during lunch (he's friends with one of my friends through boy scouts, longs story), because he lost his phone privileges because he tried to disable the parental controls so he could text more. And he had like the very newest IPhone. And he complained for months, before he got is phone back and *got a new IPhone.* Like this kid has had multiple IPhones already, yeesh. Also, he's like the epitomous Gay stereotype, the feminine voice, overblown reactions, friends with like every girl in the grade. And he's in 2 of my classes now.
