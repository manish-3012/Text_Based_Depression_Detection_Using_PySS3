I have an idea - comment a musician that comes from your country that you think deserves international recognition I know there are a lot of people from different countries and nationalities on this sub, so I thought it might be interesting to hear some of what you listen to that more people should know about. 

Write their name, a song, the language and if possible the genre and a link.

Looking forwards to hearing new stuff!
