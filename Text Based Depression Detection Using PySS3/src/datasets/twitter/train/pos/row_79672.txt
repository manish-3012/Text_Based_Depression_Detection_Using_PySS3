So I need some questions answered So I'm a 5'6 114lb 13 year old boy and I walk around 5 miles everyday.
But is that not enough? 
What is enough?
Apparently everything is bad for you and I do not know what is good.
I've sworn off red meat and am considering going full vegetarian.
But also I do shit like when I have a snack, I then look up the amount of calories it was and then walk in circles till I burn it off.
I have lost 50lbs in a year so I have a terrible relationship with food in fear of looking like shit again, And I don't ever let myself enjoy anything. 
I hate myself when I eat, and I can't relax without having a mental breakdown. Also my brain does this thing where is goes: "Well, everything you've been doing is wrong and you have made no progress." Usually after reading a shit ton of articles "how bout ya just fuckin die?" Fuck this shit dude.
I don't know what I am doing. Help me.
