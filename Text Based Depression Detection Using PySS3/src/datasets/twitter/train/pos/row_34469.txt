Thoughts on psychedelics I've been wanting to do lsd/shrooms (maybe even mdma) . I'm not really concerned over any health risks. Getting addicted to them is almost impossible.

A psychedelic trip is definitely something I want to experience at least once in my life.

The only bad thing that could happen is me getting a bad trip.

So are there any other reasons why I shouldn't at least try them?
