I donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve talked to this girl for about 2 years now and it was going great. I loved her and she loved me. But then my then best friend came into the picture and started getting intimate with her, I didnâ€™t really care because I have the mindset of â€œif we have something going on and you choose someone else then thatâ€™s your choice Iâ€™m not going to get between it.â€ So we were having a kind of on and off unofficial relationship. It was going okay until like 7-8 months ago when she just kinda disappeared with him.  Weâ€™ve talked over social media, but it just isnâ€™t the same thing. And I canâ€™t see her because sheâ€™s in a toxic relationship with her so called â€œboyfriendâ€ (my ex best friend). I just donâ€™t know what to do. I really love her with all Iâ€™ve got. Iâ€™ve been up several nightâ€™s just thinking about her and itâ€™s just fucking me up mentally. Idk I just wanted to get that off my chest.
