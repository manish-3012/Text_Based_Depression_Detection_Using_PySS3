my dad is a zoomer I don't know what to do, he uses and quotes tiktok daily and calls me bruh in public and at random times in the day. If i say something and he finds it funny he'll basically make it one of his "catch phrases". He acts personality-wise like the people r/im14andthisisdeep makes fun of. It was kind of funny at first but it's been going on for almost a year now.
