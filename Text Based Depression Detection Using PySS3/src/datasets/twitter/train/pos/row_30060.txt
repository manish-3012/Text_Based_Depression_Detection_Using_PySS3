She tried to continue the conversation when I already ended it. She did not reply to my last chat message. Any advice? Ok I was talking to a woman I like. I already ended the conversation. Then she tried to continue it by asking me a question. I responded back then asked her a similar question. Because I thought she still wanted to continue talking.

Then she did not reply..its been more than a day already. I really hate the feeling because she could not have continue the conversation if she does not have plans to reply anyway. Any advice?
