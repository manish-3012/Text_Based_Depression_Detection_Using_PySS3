Are Sleeping Pills good for a 15 year old? Help For months I have been struggling to fall asleep and I also been starting to hallucinate because of my terrible insomnia but when I fall asleep I get nightmares and and itâ€™s just like a story inside my head that continues on and on. So Iâ€™m trying to not to sleep because Iâ€™m scared that the nightmares still continues. Iâ€™ve been thinking to buy them without my parents permission (hopefully not to dream) because i donâ€™t want to worry them about it because my parents are already in stress about searching houses and a school and a lot of bullshit, and I already know they might say no...But I just want to know if itâ€™s really dangerous for a kid to take sleeping pills without a doctor to know.
