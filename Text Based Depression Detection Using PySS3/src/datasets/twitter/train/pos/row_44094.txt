Today has been kinda great. So, I'm not in the US, but Trump isn't president, a very good friend fixed his PC and we are talking for hours on Discord, and I wrote a random girl that I don't know irl but played Among Us with our class once, and she wasn't a total bitch but actually nice.  
It's just a good time after all the shit that happened in 2020, I'm happy today.
