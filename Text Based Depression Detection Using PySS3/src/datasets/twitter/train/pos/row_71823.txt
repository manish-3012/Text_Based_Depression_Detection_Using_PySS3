Does anybody have any advice for how I can help my sister with anxiety? tl;dr - i don't know how to help my anxious and compulsive sister, and am looking for advice from peers who may have dealt or be dealing with anxiety (my family is also looking into professional help, I'm just curious to hear from people who might be in similar situations)

Ever since quarantine began, my younger sister has been demonstrating worse and worse symptoms of anxiety. It's reached the point where she has to run her hand over the lock on the door 9 or so times before she feels secure, as well as minor things like always tapping the top of a doorframe and occasionally compulsively straightening things. Some of this is less concerning, but the big thing is how she doesn't feel safe at night, leading to the lock checking and frequently needing someone sleeping with her. 

I think its a fair assessment that this is, if not caused, then worsened by quarantine, the coronavirus, and now starting school online. She's expressed worries about all three things, and I think the most likely case is that her anxieties and compulsive behaviors have been aggravated by these worries.

I turn to the guidance of the internet and my peers because I understand that while there's no cookie-cutter solution, the people with the best or most realistic  information are likely fellow kids who have dealt with/are dealing with anxiety. I'm hoping that you guys have something that can help me beyond the generic solutions proposed by therapists and advice books. (We are planning to reach out to professionals, but I want to have as much  information as possible)

Anyway, I'm hoping that someone could shed some insight on things you do to manage anxieties or anything that might be helpful, I'm at a loss for how to help her and could really use help. I'll happily answer any further questions without giving away anything personal.
