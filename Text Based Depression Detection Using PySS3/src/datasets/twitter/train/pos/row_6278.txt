I need advice on where to take this friendship My friend makes me uncomfortable to be around most of the time now. Itâ€™s sad because I used to envoy hanging out with her so much. Every day I spend around her, I discover she has at least one new issue. Yesterday was Touretteâ€™s and allergies to cats and dogs AFTER she held the cat and petted the dog WITHOUT TELLING US ABOUT THE ALLERGY. She also has depression, ocd, is bipolar, has severe childhood trauma, was in the foster system, and apparently killed a man and had a 95 year old woman die on her shoulder on the bus??? Also she broke her left pinkie on purpose so that it matched the right because ocd???? She also has ZERO impulse control. While weâ€™re watching a show sheâ€™s already seen, it takes every ounce of willpower for her not to spoil things, and I actually have to stop her from eating dirt and poisonous plants like sheâ€™s a fucking baby. Slo while weâ€™re watching stuff she always cracks her joints, chews her gum super loud, and has screaming ticks like every 30 seconds. Iâ€™m I an asshole for being mad at this stuff? I just donâ€™t know anymore 


Itâ€™s kinda sad but sheâ€™s my only irl friend right now so I canâ€™t just get rid of her, also thatâ€™s a pretty assholey thing to do. We also have a lot of common interests and genuine conversations, thatâ€™s how we connected in the first place. 


In summary: The short blue hair shouldâ€™ve been a red flag...
