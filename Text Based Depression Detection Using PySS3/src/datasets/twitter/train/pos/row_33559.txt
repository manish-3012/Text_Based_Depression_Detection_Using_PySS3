Mic Mute Life Hack Apparently not a lot of people know this, but you can actually turn off your Microphone, with a click of a button, a physical one. Nearly all headsets have a button, somewhere on them, that mutes the microphone. This means that if you have to be unmuted, let's say during a zoom lesson, and you don't want to, you can just switch that button, and you are muted without anyone knowing

Hope this helps someone
