Ok I completed first day of school with my hot pink cast and it actually went great I know it's just a color but I was still nervous cause I'm shy and introverted and never do things like this lol

But my secret plan worked and it turned out to be a confidence booster cause everyone though it was dope and even some girls complimented me saying they thought it looked cool and wanted to sign it

I don't think a girl's ever complimented me before?? I gotta break more bones so I can do this again
