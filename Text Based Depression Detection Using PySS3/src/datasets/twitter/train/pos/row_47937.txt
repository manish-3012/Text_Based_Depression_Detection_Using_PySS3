I know itâ€™s terrible, I know Iâ€™m an asshole but I donâ€™t give a fuck. My life is in shambles. I canâ€™t do anything right. 9/10 girls reject me. A friend just stabbed me I. A friend just stabbed me in the back. My dad is verbally abusing me and my mother. I get yelled at and grounded for doing anything to retaliate against my brother when he breaks my things or messes with me. But he never gets in trouble for it. All of this has made me an asshole because I donâ€™t want anyone else in my life. People suck and scare me. I want to be an asshole so Iâ€™m left alone. I donâ€™t want to date anymore because no one is willing to put up with me and my traumatized ass. Iâ€™m a solid 6.5 so it might be because of that. 

I donâ€™t want pity I want to die.
