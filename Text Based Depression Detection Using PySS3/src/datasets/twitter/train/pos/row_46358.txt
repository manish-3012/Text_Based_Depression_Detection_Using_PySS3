"Don't write your own screenplay, write this instead!" What's the point of this assignment anyway? I get that it's to help us pass the class but seriously? No creativity and originality? Just this?  


" Write a short screenplay that is based on the following scenario: *A group of teenagers has a problem that must be solved by the end of the screenplay."*

Isn't our class supposed to be creative in our writing instead of writing about scenarios you give us? What's wrong with something original?
