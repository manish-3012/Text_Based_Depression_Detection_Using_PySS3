What does this mean? So there's this girl that I like, Iâ€™ll call her Sarah (not her real name). She used to show some interest in me but not really anymore, so I kinda pushed her to the back of my mind. But in the past couple of weeks, she suddenly started giving me a bunch of compliments. The other day I was talking to my other friend (who happened to be a girl) about adding her on Discord, and Sarah was standing within earshot of us. Later the same day, Sarah asked me for my Discord username. I told her that I would give it to her after school, but I ended up not seeing her when class dismissed. When I got home, I looked at my phone and I had received a message from an unknown number, saying â€œHey (my name), itâ€™s me Sarahâ€ Note that I had not given out my phone number except to a select group of friends, and to my knowledge, it is not anywhere else on the internet. How did she get my number? Why? Iâ€™m a 14 year old male, and by the fact that Iâ€™m posting this on Reddit, you can assume the rest about me. Thanks for reading all of that.
