Thoughts on last night's debate I will say, last night's debate was a mess. I would be lying if I said Biden won but I'd be lying too if I said Trump won. It was pretty much a stalemate and I don't think it really changed any minds. The one thing that really struck me was the part where Trump "refused to condemn white supremacy". There are MULTIPLE instances of Trump calling out white supremacy. 

[1:57 "And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis or the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally."](https://youtu.be/JmaZR8E12bs?t=117) 

[2:44 "Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs. Including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."](https://youtu.be/00RAteYexNA?t=164)

It amazes me that people still believe that Trump called neo-Nazis "very fine people".

To those that say Trump won't condemn white supremacy, he did just that three years ago.

I was disappointed that Chris Wallace, the moderator, didn't press Biden hard enough. He could have asked him about his "you ain't black" comment but he didn't. What about the time when he called service members ["stupid bastards"?](https://youtu.be/FjPH2szmf6Y?t=8)
