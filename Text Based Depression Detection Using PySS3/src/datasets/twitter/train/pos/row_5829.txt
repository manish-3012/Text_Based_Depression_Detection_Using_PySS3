Helped man with money and feel bad :/ I was going back from school and saw that random man trying talk to me, i took earphones off and he told me that he needed money to train ticket, he looked like arabic. I think for a little and i decided to give him 20, its not small money for student  but money is not a problem to me. I gave him money, he thanked me. But shortly after I started suspect that he neede money for train, what if he just fooled me and will use it ti drugs, cant stop think about it:/
