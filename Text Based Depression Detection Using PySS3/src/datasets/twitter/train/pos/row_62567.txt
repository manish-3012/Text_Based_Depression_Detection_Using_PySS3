AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (Complaining/begging idiot here, don't mind it.) So I make music, shitty music, but music nonetheless, I want to officially release it cause I, ideally, want to make making music my job (a tad unrealistic, but hey, why not give it a shot anyway?) but to actually release it you need album art, and I am not in any way capable to make any myself (as beside music I can't do anything that requires creativity, and even my music is kinda crappy.) and commissioning people to do it costs money, which I don't have. I do have some artist friends, but I'm not close enough to casually request them to make something as it'd seem like I'd be using them, cause I don't know them that well. If anyone here wants to help, I'd greatly appreciate it, but if you don't want to/aren't able to, please just ignore this, I'm not much deserving of free art, but hey, if I don't ask I won't get an answer, so I might as well. Thank you!
