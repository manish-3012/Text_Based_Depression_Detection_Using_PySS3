Can we just let people enjoy whatever form of social media they use? Whether itâ€™s been the â€œInstagram badâ€ or the â€œI hate TikTokâ€ posts, why are posts hating on people for just enjoying a different form of social media? Like people at my school made fun of reddit for this â€œsense of superiority.â€ Nearly all social media is gonna have some cool sections and some pretty lame sections. There is some really cool art on tiktok! I havenâ€™t used the app much but I still understand that regardless do what social media, blatantly hating on people for using it isnâ€™t really productive. Let people enjoy what they enjoy, same thing like letting children enjoy fortnite. Letâ€™s be the generation that doesnâ€™t deny people things or hate on them just because we donâ€™t personally enjoy it.
