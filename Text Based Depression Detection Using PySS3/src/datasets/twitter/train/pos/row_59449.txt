Trying to clear the "Christian Karen" stereotype Hi all!  First, I'd like to get a couple things out of the way.
1. I am a Christian, which is why I'm making this post
2. I know the coronavirus is really and that wearing a mask is the best thing a person can do right now
3. I am NOT trying to say Christians are being oppressed, I'm simply trying to clear up a bad stereotype.
4.  If you aren't a Christian or of the Christian belief, I respect you and your beliefs.  I ask that you also respect mine.

I feel like Christians have been getting a bad rep recently for having a lot of karen's or claiming that "the coronavirus isn't real.". These arguments tend to come from older Christians who are misinformed or just downright stubborn.  Not all of us are like this, most of us lay low and wear masks like we're supposed to.

Second I'd like to address the homophobic people in the Christian faith.  I want to make myself chrystal clear right now when I say that if you are in the lgbtq+ community, I have nothing against you and neither do any of my Christian friends.  The Bible says things about homosexual people, but that is simply our beliefs.  Again, most homophobic posts come from older people.  If you don't believe in the Bible it's okay.  It's your decision.  But we as Christians have chosen to believe in the Bible, so I ask that you respect our beliefs.

Now, am I saying that homophobia or transphobia or anything that Karens do is okay?  Absolutely not.  All I ask is that you respect our beliefs the same way you respect any other religion.

I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

Have a great day and thank you for reading!
