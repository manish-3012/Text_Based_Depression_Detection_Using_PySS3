Don't give up I've been in multiple bad relationships because I thought no relationship was perfect, after the last one I thought of remaining single til my 20's. 

After being single for 2 years, my best friend, that I met around the time of my last breakup and helped me through it, broke up with her bf. We spent a lot of time together and I just tried my very best to cheer her up, I thought of her as my little sister, I just couldn't see her that sad.

About 2 months ago I realized that I probably didn't see her as my sister, we've been through so much together and we're the only people we both 100% trust, we never had a fight or a disagreement, I was blind because I thought I'd never find someone like her.

I told her how I felt and she wanted to give me a chance, we didn't treat eachother as friends anymore, and by the time of writing we had our first valentine's and we're hopelessly in love, I'm planning on making it official when I can see her on a regular basis, as I don't have my driver's license yet and she lives quite far.

Oh, and her family has been waiting for us to go out since she broke up, so some people saw it coming apparently.

Everyone, don't give up hope, don't get in bad relationships, maybe the person you'll really love has been right beside you this entire time, you'll find love.
