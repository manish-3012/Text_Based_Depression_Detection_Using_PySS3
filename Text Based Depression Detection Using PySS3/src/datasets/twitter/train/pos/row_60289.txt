I'm really in this cute girl but idk how to make my move. I met this really cute girl through musical theatre a few weeks ago, and instantly had a crush on her. I'm decently confident, but can't come to say I like her as the fact we dance together in musical theatre, and if she doesn't like me how awkward it'd be. I have her number and snap, but have been pretty casual with her. If anyone could help me... I need it.

TL:DR I'm into a cute girl, and need advice.
