What Should I do? Crush: She/Her
Homie: He/Him
Crush's Partner: They/Them in this post

So I have a crush on this one girl, but she's dating someone (they're "on break" rn) but her Partner is cheating on her with one of my homies. 
Should I;
A. Tell my Homie to break up with them bc their REALLY toxic towards him
Or B. Tell Her what's happening
