I honestly don't know if this is the place but does anyone know anything about Lord of the Rings? So I know absolutely nothing about the books or movies and I want to start watching the movies in order but I don't know where to start, Google was no help. So should I start with the hobbit or lotr, or maybe a third thing I don't know about. If someone could just give me a list of what order I should watch the movies in that would be great, thanks.
