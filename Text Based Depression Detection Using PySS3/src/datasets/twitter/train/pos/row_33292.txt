I've accidentally said super smooth pick up lines multiple times. Here they are because I think they're funny. When I say multiple I mean 3, and when I say 3 I had forgotten 1.

Hers the first
Me: Yeah sorry I was playing terraria.
Girl: Oh i haven't played terraria in ages.
Me: You should play it, its good.
Girl: I can't be fucked.
Me: You should be.

Girl was a lesbian btw.

Next one needs some context, for some reason people in our friend group like to adopt or marry people. Person i first talked to was child of the second.

Guy: I'm so sexy
Me: What do you mean, you don't look like your mum.
Girl: I'm his mum.
