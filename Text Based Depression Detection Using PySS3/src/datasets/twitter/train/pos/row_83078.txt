What the fuck Epic games I was downloading rainbow six(85 GB). I was 75% done when my pc ran into a problem and had to restart

Ok thatâ€™s fine, the files should still be there I thought. I loaded up epic games launcher and:

â€œDirectory must be clear. â€œ

Apparently I have to have a clear directory to install it. It canâ€™t resume

I try I method I read online, but it just doesnâ€™t work. I have to redownload 85GB
