2nd date!!!!!! LITERALLY ECSTATIC FROM HOW IT WENT this is not a joke, no meme here, i'm literally super pumped about what happened. After months of texting and 1 ok date, we went to her town, and we held hands, cuddled, eat pizza, it was literally amazing. She was also super cute, wearing thigh highs, a lace skirt, and some small heels. Sorry if this is karmawh\*ring, i just needed a place to say how fucking happy I am.
