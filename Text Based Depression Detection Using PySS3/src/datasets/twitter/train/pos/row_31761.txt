Okay story time! since some of you wanted to hear some of my weird childhood stories hereâ€™s one that iâ€™d class as my â€˜craziestâ€™

so i was about five years old and i was playing in the garden in my sandpit, a little ladybug one with the wings as a sort of roof for it. Well it started raining and me being little didnâ€™t want to go indoors. Instead i just pulled the roof over me and laid down in the sandpit. I fell asleep because it was warm in there and the sounds of the rain was quite soothing. 

As far as i know or was told i wasnâ€™t found there for about another four hours. My dad had come out to check on me and bring me inside because it was raining but he couldnâ€™t see me in the garden and panicked. We had a gap between the garden wall and the garage so he thought i mustâ€™ve gotten out through there and went out searching for me. 

When he couldnâ€™t see me on any of the roads anywhere nearby he called my mum who was at work and explained to her what he thought had happened. They then called the police and my aunt who helped search for me as well. It had only struck him then that he never checked the sandpit to see if i was still there so he went back home and checked. 

Sure enough there was little me still asleep in the sandpit so he had to tell the police it was alright and everyone else from the family who was worried were told as well. 

TL:DR- when i was little i got a police search party called on me because i fell asleep in a sandpit.
