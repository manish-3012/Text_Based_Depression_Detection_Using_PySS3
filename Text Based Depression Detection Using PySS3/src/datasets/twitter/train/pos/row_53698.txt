Saying the lyrics of a song day one Everything I said went right over your head your head went right over your head

fuck em off and end up with your best freind instead instead your best freind instead

i just spent 3 million dollars the fell in her bed in her bed they fell in her bed

i can switch it up in the blink of a eye so you cant copy see

cause im the big dog you chasing the fleas


Everything I said went right over your head your head went right over your head

she keep trynna text me leave her messages on read on read leave em on read 

fuck em off and end up with your best freind instead instead your best freind instead

i just spent 3 million dollars the fell in her bed in her bed they fell in her bed

if you dont comprehend it her we cant see eye to eye 


Everything I said went right over your head your head went right over your head

she keep trynna text me leave her messages on read on read leave em on read 

fuck em off and end up with your best freind instead instead your best freind instead

i just spent 3 million dollars the fell in her bed in her bed they fell in her bed
