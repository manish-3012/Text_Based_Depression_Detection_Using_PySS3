I want roommates so bad No joke, Iâ€™m tired of living with my family. I love them but they REALLY get on my nerves pretty much every day. Not even one normal day here. I want to live with friends and itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™ve never met anyone as judge mental as my parents. Iâ€™ve had roommates before at camps and itâ€™s so fun to live with people you actually like. You get to do cool things all the time and I donâ€™t even have to put in the effort to make plans because theyâ€™re right there. Iâ€™m really excited about living in a dorm hopefully Iâ€™m the spring
