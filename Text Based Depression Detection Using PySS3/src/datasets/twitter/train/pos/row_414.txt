Does anyone else see streaky lines when looking at lights Like whenever I look at headlights or a lamp or a traffic light thereâ€™s long lines of light, not a fade. If any of you have it its apparently a really common eye defect. Itâ€™s called astigmatism and I thought it always was supposed to look streaky.
