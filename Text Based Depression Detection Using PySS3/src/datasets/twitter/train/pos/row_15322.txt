Guilt over something that I shouldnâ€™t feel guilt about So I feel guilty and I feel pain in my heart idk how to describe it when I think of my friend who I havenâ€™t spoken to in months cause theyâ€™ve been isolated but something bad happened to them and even tho it wasnâ€™t anywhere near my fault I feel bad cause I felt responsible for them and now it hurts cause when I hear their name or think back to a song that we both liked I think of them and it hurts idk how to describe it
