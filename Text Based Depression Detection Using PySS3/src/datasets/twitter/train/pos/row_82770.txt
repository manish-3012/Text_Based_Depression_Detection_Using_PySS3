What can I talk about when talking to a girl? Iâ€˜m not really socially awkward in the sense that I never talk, but when I want to start a discussion, I never know what to talk about, and sometimes there is an akward silence that occurs.
Once the discussion starts though, I can usually continue talk normally, until we both run out of things to say.Iâ€˜m just wondering what topics could be interesting, not only for girls but in general (I often have the same problem with boys)
P.S. is this to be flaired as an Advice or Social?
