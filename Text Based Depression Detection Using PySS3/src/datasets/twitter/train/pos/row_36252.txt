Why is it that I, a teenage female, do not like any of the decisions that other teenage females make in movies? There will be spoilers. I'll give 3 movie examples. 

Twilight: Bella had two loyal boys vying for her heart. Where Edward was secretive, Jacob was her best friend and very open with her. He was sweet and took care of her when Edward ran off yet, when he came back she went straight to Edward. I know I am not her but I don't like that she chose him, after all that he put her through. I think she should have chose Jacob. 

To All The Boys I've Loved Before 2: Same as above. Lara Jean should have picked John Ambrose. It seems like in all these movies, the main girl gets involved with a great guy and catches feelings for him, while still being in a relationship. These girls create bonds with these boys they will never love back because they always go running back to guys that hurt them or left. Or when all signs point to no, it's right back to Peter or Edward. 

The Kissing Booth 2: El, just like Bella and Lara Jean, led on Marco and she wasn't seeing it! Until she realized that something was going on and even when she did, she kept going. When she went and visited Noah in Boston, he was lying to her, she found an earring under his bed, and he was 3000 miles away yet he still wanted her to trust him. Even after it all, all the lying between them, him lying about whatsherface and her lying about Marco, she still went right back to him. Marco wasn't lying to her and in the end, when she chose him, he still told his homies that she was worth it. Noah left and wasnt honest with her, Marco was there and honest. I don't understand why she just didn't pick Marco! 

I just don't understand these girls!
