7 days ago 7 days ago I lost my cat to congestive heart failure. She was my little girl and my whole family has changed. Monster was alot to me and was one of the sole reasons I'm still here. I struggl to wrap my head around her being gone. That she will never run around the house at 2am or never curl up next to me and purr in my ear. Its a hard change but I must move on. I did not post for your sympathy or empathy. I posted cause I want this little girl to be remembered by more people.
