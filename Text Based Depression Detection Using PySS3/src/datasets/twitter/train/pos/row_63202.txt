Autistic siblings are extremely frustrating. (I know people with autism genuinely struggle I just need to rant about this)
My little brother CONSTANTLY  takes my food (FROM A BOX THAT IS ALWAYS HIDDENIN MY ROOM!), shouts, glares and screams at me for no reason. Its stressful enough on a good day, but good days for him are extremely rare. Most days, to be honest, I feel he's just being a little brat, and my mom definitely let's him get away with way too much. The most he has been "punished" recently is he has his 30 minutes on the ps4 taken away... HE'S 6!!! I had to wait till my dad got a ps4 to get his ps3. I'm just really pissed that my parents constantly disagree with how they should deal with his bratty behaviour. 
Mom blames it on his autism but Dad sees its just a bratty attitude where the crotch goblin is allowed to get away with all the crap he pulls. 
I'll be perfectly honest I felt really embarrassed going out as a family. AND NOT BECAUSE I AM ASHAMED OF MY BROTHER BEING AUTISTIC!! Its purely because my mom doesn't want to discipline him. She won't put him on the mat for screaming, shouting or swinging at someone. She won't keep up with taking playstation time away for stealing my food (that I pay for with MY OWN MONEY) 
I'm really proud of my lil bro wen he's genuinely trying to be good but it's his bratty behaviour and "mommy's precious boy" attitude that just winds me up and makes me feel so shit cz I feel like I can't do anything to help him out of it. 

(Please if anyone has any advice on how to help him or my parents out let me know)
