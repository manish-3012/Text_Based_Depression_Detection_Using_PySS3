â€œDonâ€™t tell girls to cover up, tell boys to look awayâ€ is a silly argument Firstly, Iâ€™m not arguing that girls should cover up, I do not give a fuck lol

If Iâ€™m not paying attention, I wonâ€™t be paying attention anyways, therefore telling girls to cover up because itâ€™s distracting is silly

But just as a girl has the freedom to dress however she wants, a guy should have the freedom to look wherever he wants, and you best believe if im bored as fuck in math class and Iâ€™m not allowed on my phone, I will stare at titties.

I will do it, I will stare right at those titties because my brain needs stimulation.

Donâ€™t bullshit me, everyone does it, every guy stares and every girl stares and if you donâ€™t, congrats youâ€™re either asexual or a saint. But stop demonizing people for doing normal shit because youâ€™re on your high horse
