I hate the word 'voice changer' It's about as dumb sounding as 'food preparer' or 'test giver'.

Essentially, this post is a petition to instead call them "audio effects" and NOT sound like stupid laypersons.

Also, let me know if you want me to make a post, schooling y'all about the types of effects you can find in typical audio effects software (and also that quick mac n cheese recipe on which I had to make a post but never did)
