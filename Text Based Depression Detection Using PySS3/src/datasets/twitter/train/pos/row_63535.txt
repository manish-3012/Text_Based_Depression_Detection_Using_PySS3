I fucking quit: A long ass rant about today I apologize in advance. This is gonna be a shitshow, and a long one at that.

Iâ€™ve written about my sister tons of times on this sub. She still finds ways to fuck up my life, so you guys have this story.

So Iâ€™ve been waking up at around noon. (Important to the rant later)

I wake up, and I go to get cereal. But alas, there are no clean bowls. And this is why:

It is my sisters job to do dishes. It has always been. My mom runs a really busy Etsy store, and is on call daily at the hospital. She has no time. My sister has been told for 4 WEEKS STRAIGHT to do the dishes. She has not. And she doesnâ€™t care. Sheâ€™ll find some other dish to use. 

So after 4 weeks of no clean dishes, me and my mom are sick of it. She offers me 20 bucks to do the dishes. She is that desperate. So I go in there to do them, and my sister comes in and â€œlecturesâ€ me about how to do them. (It wasnâ€™t a lecture, it was her yelling at me for 3 minutes straight) so I start doing them. I clean the nasty fucking bowls, the nasty fucking plates, the NASTY FUCKING MUGS SHE USED AS BOWLS, everything. Now Iâ€™m already sick of all her shit. I ask her for her dirty dishes. She says â€œno.â€ So Iâ€™m like â€œitâ€™s less work for me and less dishes for her. Fineâ€ I continue doing the dishes. So imagine my surprise when she brings in a BANANA BREAD PAN with fruit loops in it, suspended in MILK THAT IS AS GREEN AS THE GREEN FUCKING FRUIT LOOPS. THE MILK IS SOLID. I then announced â€œfuck this, 20 dollars is not worth the disease Iâ€™m gonna get from this â€˜milkâ€™â€ so I leave and go to my room.

I call my friend to see if I can go over there to escape this hell hole. He says yeah, but they canâ€™t pick me up. Thatâ€™s a problem. I ask why, and can you guess what he said? 

He said â€œI was already over there and you didnâ€™t come out so now weâ€™re low on gas.â€ 

I hang up.

HE WAS OVER HERE AT ELEVEN AM TRYING TO PICK ME UP. HE NEVER TOLD ME HE WAS DOING THAT. 

WHO
FUCKING
DOES
THAT

so now Iâ€™m sitting on my bed, trying not to either kill my friend, my sister, or me.

Have a nice day.
