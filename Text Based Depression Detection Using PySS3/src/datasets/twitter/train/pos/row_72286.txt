my iphone 6 has a problem with the wifi lol so basically the wifi is bad on my phone. like really fucking bad. but on every other device or computer the wifi is fine. its very hard to connect, and i can enter the pass correctly but it says its wrong. most of the time it disconnects randomly, and is disconnected for most of the day. sometimes if i get 2 bars on my wifi connection and i open app, lets say tiktok, it goes back to 1 which is super annoying. this has been going or for a week what do i do
