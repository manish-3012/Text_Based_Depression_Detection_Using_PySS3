I swear some day I'm going to get arrhythmia I'm not aware of my dreams most of the time but when I am the always scare me awake the most common method is making me fall off of something like a cliff or building and when I hit the ground I wake up. Other times it's something stupid but falling off of a cliff is terrifying my heart rate increases significantly because it turns out contemplating your death while falling to it sucks.
