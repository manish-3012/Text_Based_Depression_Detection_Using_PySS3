Why do series and movies constantly portray it as funny, deserved, no big deal, "girlpower", etc. when girls kick guys in the balls hard to hurt, humiliate and/or punish them as males by exploiting their male weak spot and genitals? Why do they portray it as "normal" between children or siblings?

How is this NOT sexual violence and humiliation? How is this ANY better than when boys grope girls and put them in that kind of agony, either because they gets some sick joy as boys out of doing this to girls, to "punish" them because they "overstepped as females" (because this is how it's portrayed the other way around), or in anger? How?

When a girl does this to a boy for no GOOD reason, why should he NOT give her a hard punch in the fucking face for it once he can stand again?
