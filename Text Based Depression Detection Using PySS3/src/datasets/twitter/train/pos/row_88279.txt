I know I said this yesterday, but damnit, it's really hitting me hard today. FUCK coviddddddd. Fuck it. Fuck covid. I'd be in school rn if it weren't for you!! I would be having funnnn. But nooooooooo. You just have to fuck up my freshman year. I'm going to go into highschool not knowing the layout in sophomore year! Fuck Covid!! I'd be actually actively trying to get a girlfriend, but noooooo. Covid just has to infect us all in the ass. I'm tired of it. I want to see people. I want to do things. I want to try and lose my virginity. I want to experience shit. Fuck the house I'm in rn. I want to experience people again. I want human contact. It doesn't even have to be sexual. I just wanna fuck around with my friends. Fuck you, covid. You fucked me this year. I can't even do workouts at my school cuz my governor is being a cu*t. I know I could workout at home, and I'm trying. But I haven't found the discipline to do that yet. It's really hard for me rn, especially because my grandma moved in, and now I have no room to workout. Fuck Covid. This shit sucks. I marked this as serious because I don't rlly want jokes rn. But yeah this is also a rant. Fuck Covid. This shit might have screwed me in the ass, and I'm not fond of it.
