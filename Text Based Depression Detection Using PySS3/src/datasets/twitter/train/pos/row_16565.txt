Teachers who pick out random students to answer questions. I hate you 
This was a few months ago but i keep thinking about.

This was the last class of the day and it was a maths class. I am very bad at maths and I have anxiety. We had a substitute teacher. The teacher asked a very simple maths question to the class. No one raised their hand to answer. He began to get frustrated and said that heâ€™ll just pick out a random person to answer it. My heart began to beat very fast. I sat in the front row right infront of the teacher. The teacher pointed to me and said 
-You, answer the question.

My mind went completely blank.

I replied no thank you quietly.

He said -No, answer it.

I said no thank you again.

-Come on youâ€™re wasting everyones time. Said the teacher annoyed. 

A guy in the back of the class yelled just answer the question. 

I started panicking.

I asked if i could go to the bathroom. 

He laughed and said -Itâ€™s that hard huh. Just go

I went to the bathroom and had a panic attack and cried.
