Sometimes I wonder why life cant be great again Starting college as a freshman soon and I'm excited, but I ain't gonna lie I'd rather go back 4 years and be in that same position as a high schooler. Times were simpler then and looking back on my Instagram page, it was fun just posting what I wanted (memes, sports pics, a pic of me occasionally) was neat. I also just accepted everyone as a follower but eventually (last year) trimmed it down to 30 (dont know why I did it but I regret it). Plus I was basically reporting news for an entire meme community during the summer after that freshman year and that got interesting. God man.
