I caught my friend staring at... Iâ€™m bored and didnâ€™t felt like doing homework so I wanna tell you some stories about what I just seen back in January through March.

Now this was back in January-March before online. So we were in a group, doing our task. One of them needed to use the bathroom, so it was the three of us. Two of my friends started talking random things where all of a sudden, my friend shouted (not loudly) saying something in Spanish (Forgot what he said). 

When I looked at him I was like in my mind â€œwhat is itâ€ until I looked at the way he is looking at and there it was...

My friend was staring at a girls ass. She was bending over with her chair and When I looked at it I was like in my mind â€œwoah ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¶â€ and when I looked at him he looked at me With a ðŸ˜‰ smile. As I look at him, it looked like he is saying in his mind to me, â€œ[my name] You cannot believe how I feel right now, because what I just saw right now, was the best day of my life ðŸ˜Œ.â€ I can tell he is not the only one who just saw it.
