waah waah an edgy rant I'm just fucking tired of everything, and of you too. nothing makes fucking sense. I'll probably kill myself really really soon and I'm not gaslighting you or whatever this thing is called, I'm just stating the obvious and i don't even get why people should care. why save lives? who cares and why should we? 

all of this is so hopeless. I'm happy for people who think otherwise but for me it'll always stay the same, and I'll probably continue to litter this sub with useless cringy shit!

can't stand the fact that I'll have to do things tomorrow. also can't stand the fact that I don't keep my rants to myself, unlike other people who i love dearly and wish for them to do nothing but succeed in life and live happily ever after in a beautiful house
