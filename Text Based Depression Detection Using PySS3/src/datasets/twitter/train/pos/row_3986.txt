Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 19 Hello everyone! Hope you're having a nice day! Remember, if you have any questions or topics about space that you'd like to see me do facts on, I'd love to hear! See ya tomorrow!

Fact: A single NASA spacesuit costs millions of dollars to make! In fact, NASA currently only has 4 EVA-ready spacesuits available (In case you didn't know, EVA stands for "extra-vehicular activity", basically it's when an astronaut does a spacewalk). The last EVA-ready spacesuit was built in 1974, and it cost somewhere between 15 million and 22 million dollars. That's right around 150 million dollars in today's money! For a single spacesuit!! This is because spacesuits are incredibly complex, and are essentially their own spacecraft, but made for humans. These aren't your ordinary work clothes! They have to:

Protect the astronaut against the vacuum of space, and from intense solar radiation.

Protect against tiny particles moving at up to 18,000 miles per hour.

Provide oxygen, communications, telemetry, and everything else a human needs to survive.

Allow the wearer to still perform tasks and have decent maneuverability during spacewalks.

These things are COMPLEX. And it's actually starting to become a problem. NASA is running out of good spacesuits! Fortunately, they have dedicated $250,000,000 to the development of the new xEMU suit, which is to be used for the Artemis missions to the Moon, beginning in 2024. These suits are fitted with the latest tech, and will allow our astronauts of the future to do things much easier, and hopefully much cheaper!
