Guys this sucks Iâ€™m trying to explain to my mom how much I donâ€™t want to go back to my college and how much I hate being on campus, and that Iâ€™m worried about COVID exposure, and would much rather do my online classes at home, but she just wonâ€™t listen. She wonâ€™t respect my decision to stay, and refuses to see how upset being at school makes me. I had a really hard time first semester, and donâ€™t want to repeat that, and I think staying home this semester would be best for me because I wasnâ€™t ready to be thrown out into the world and staying at home while doing my classes helps, but my mom wonâ€™t see that. It makes me really upset that she wonâ€™t listen and let me stay home, and only does what she thinks is best, which is what would be best for a person like her, which I am nowhere near close to. The worst part is, my dad promised I could stay home, and that he would try to convince my mom, but they didnâ€™t even talk about it, and now heâ€™s saying he never promised or even said that. I canâ€™t go back. Iâ€™m supposed to return tomorrow, but I canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t go back there.
