Is it fanon if I expirience the Star Wars saga the way it was then or is it legitmate? i missed out on star wars while it was just 1-6 and clone wars so im trying to make up for. it

star wars isthe greatest story ever told
there will neverbe another one like it

i dont want to live this life without expiriencing it

thats a sad painful way to live

is it fanon if i expirience it that way or ia it good?
