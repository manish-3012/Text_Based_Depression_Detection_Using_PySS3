Anyone wanna chat? Dmmmmm me :))) The apricot is a small tree, 8â€“12 m (26â€“39 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 40 cm (16 in) in diameter and a dense, spreading canopy. The leaves are ovate, 5â€“9 cm (2.0â€“3.5 in) long and 4â€“8 cm (1.6â€“3.1 in) wide, with a rounded base, a pointed tip and a finely serrated margin. The flowers are 2â€“4.5 cm (0.8â€“1.8 in) in diameter, with five white to pinkish petals; they are produced singly or in pairs in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a drupe similar to a small peach, 1.5â€“2.5 cm (0.6â€“1.0 in) diameter (larger in some modern cultivars), from yellow to orange, often tinged red on the side most exposed to the sun; its surface can be smooth (botanically described as: glabrous) or velvety with very short hairs (botanically: pubescent). The flesh is usually firm and not very juicy. Its taste can range from sweet to tart. The single seed is enclosed in a hard, stony shell, often called a "stone" or "kernel", with a grainy, smooth texture except for three ridges running down one side.[4][5]
