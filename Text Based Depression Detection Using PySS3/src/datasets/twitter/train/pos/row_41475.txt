Yo why is it so difficult to get out of bed Like when i go to bed ill be like "yeah no matter how tired i am in the morning im gonna force myself to hop into a nice cold shower" and then in the morning its like i have zero willpower and sleep is the most important thing and ill literally sleep until the minute my classes start. Like thinking about it now it seams so easy like just get out of bed smh but when i wake up it feels like im permanantly bound to the bed i dont get what am i supposed to do its not even like i dont get enough sleep i sleep 8 hours
