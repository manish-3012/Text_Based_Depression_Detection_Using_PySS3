My school administrators and the students are idiots... (off my chest) On Sunday, the school notified families that a high school student (Iâ€™m in the HS) caught COVID-19. They ended up quarantining 30 students and 5 teachers. Guess what? Everyone was in the building the next day.

Wanna know WHY the person caught COVID? Because they went to a damn amusement park over the weekend (half my school friends on Snapchat did, surprise surprise!).

Monday afternoon, and the school sends out another email informing of someone else who caught it. Turns out it was THE LUNCH CASHIER! Half the school has to have COVID by now!

After parents started raising concerns and criticism, the school has basically shifted all the blame on us for what reason I donâ€™t know, and theyâ€™ve turned the schools into a prison basically, super strict about everything and anything we do.

We have been all in school 5 days a week, and everyone has decided to go to public venues with no masks and now all of a sudden everyone is baffled and in shock that something happened... yet we do nothing about it!

I know that was long, but I just needed to get it off my chest about how frustrating everything is right now.
