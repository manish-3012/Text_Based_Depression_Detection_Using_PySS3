Hi, I'm a lofi/indie artist. I'm curating a weekly playlist on Spotify, and I need your help! What artists should I be checking out? Our generation (gen z) are absolutely amazing for finding hidden underground artists, and I want your help! The link to the playlist is  [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Y5GFYOJPnv02fYDBYazrf?si=ANh8tLK3Tvep1YmmOwURTw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Y5GFYOJPnv02fYDBYazrf?si=ANh8tLK3Tvep1YmmOwURTw).

Thank you for your help &lt;3
