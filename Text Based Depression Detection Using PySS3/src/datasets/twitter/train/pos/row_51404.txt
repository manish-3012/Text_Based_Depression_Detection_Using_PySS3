Vegan Pizza is not pizza its sadness and despair in A poor imitation of the best food ever created. If it's not actual cheese it's not pizza.... If you like vegetables on your pizza I will not contest the presence of them on a good pie... But you need actual crust actual cheese actual good tomato sauce or whatever kind of sauce you're using to have good actual pizza otherwise it's just a circle of sadness.
