I think two people just hooked up right in front of my window A friend I know across the street is having a party for some high school friends who still want to have a homecoming even with the virus. Not like 100 people or anything, like 20. Anyway, someone parked in front of my house. I didnâ€™t think anyone was inside, but long story short, another teen walked up to the car (forgot something, etc) and surprised two teens my age doing their, uh business in the backseat. So yeah.
