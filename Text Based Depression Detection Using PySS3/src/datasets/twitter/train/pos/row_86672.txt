How the fuck do i talk to someone that isnt a guy without this horrible nervousness? Like i know that there is this humongous friend web that i'm not in, and i don't think most of them particularly want me in that, but most of the women in my grade are part of that group.

If i ask someone out, and they say no, 100% they're going to tell everyone in that group, and *honestly?* i'd rather be alone and sad, than alone and made fun of.
