yall ever listen to space is cool and cry? so many memories associated with that song for me. markiplier is a youtuber i grew up with and still watch to this day because his content remains amazing. but sometimes i watch his older stuff and listen to that song and the flooding of the memories overwhelms me and i just cry because my body doesnt know what to do
