Help me get rid of my bowl cut Hi, some im 18,  been w i d e most my life, so after loosing shite loads of weight recently, I want to get an actual hair style thats not just an average 7 year old bowl cut. There's some people in my classes that I kinda want to replicate, it is like short on the side and back, kinda like a 5/10 bowlcut half way up and then its like kinda thin but all spikey on the fringe. I want it, it looks cool, I've got no idea what it is or how to ask for it so pls help :)

If it helps, im 5 10, kinda skinny and definitely don't lift 

Thank you
