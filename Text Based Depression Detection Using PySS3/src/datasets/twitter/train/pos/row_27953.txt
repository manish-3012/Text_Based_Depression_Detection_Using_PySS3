I think I waste my time regretting things bc Iâ€™m not actually doing anything Itâ€™s pointless and itâ€™s not helping anyone thinking about what I could have done but thatâ€™s what my mind automatically goes to when I donâ€™t have shit to do. I have things to do now that Iâ€™m not doing which is normal ik. I just gotta be constantly watching, listening, or doing something or else thatâ€™s all I fucking think about. It wonâ€™t stop, Iâ€™m not kidding. All my head does is regret things, I donâ€™t think it does anything else when Iâ€™m not doing something
