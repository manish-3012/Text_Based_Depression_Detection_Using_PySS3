sorta day 23 of skipping school i went to online class twice but make it once bc one of them was class i dropped. 

yeah uhm i donâ€™t want to go bc my english teacher is way too strict and we hAve to log into our school accounts or else he wonâ€™t let us join. all of my school linked shits have a picture from the 6th grade. why the fuck do i want to sit through a class when my picture from 6 years ago is gonna be on screen the whole time. 

oh then i just donâ€™t want to catch up in the other 2 classes. senior capstone is so stupid. economics isnâ€™t that bad. i just got switched to it though so idk

and yes it really is that serious because everyone else is gonna have their nice pictures from last year on the screen.

i really donâ€™t know why mine was never updated like everyone else has their most recent school picture ???
