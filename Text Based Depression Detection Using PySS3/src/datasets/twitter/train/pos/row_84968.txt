Silencing us is like having a debate but we can't speak. My parents always tells me (and my sister), that to never talk back. My mom beat me up one time for not completely cleaning the upper floor (Hey, she only said to clean my room, I never heard her to clean the whole floor.) and I *yelled* "Why do you keep beating us? We're old now! You do know it hurts a lot.". She then beat me up again. Why? Just why? I think it is DiSrEsPeCtFuL to you, but for us, we need to speak for ourselves too. Talking back about how you fell should be fine.

Side note: I have overcome the pain of being beaten by having magic hands. Just rub it around the beaten part and the pain instantly goes away. Perks of being an Asian (lol)
