i had a breakdown in class cause i kept getting asked what im doing for my future and im gonna die in my 20s from either suicide or my health problems, and i literally have no plans except to 420 blaze and cry in bed

so being asked about my future goals in life after school is stressful asf and i wish theyd stop asking
