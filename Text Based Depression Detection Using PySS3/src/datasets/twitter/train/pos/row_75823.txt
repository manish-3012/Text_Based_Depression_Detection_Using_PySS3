why *the fuck* do mosquitoes exist just why

i caught the dengue fever a few days ago and this morning i started to get symptoms

its making me feel like fucking literal *SHIT*, my spine and my head hurt a lot, my blood pressure is painfully high, my back neck is literally pulsating, my temperature is way too high and it makes me feel cold even tho its fucking 32Â°C (nearly 90Â°F)...

#why the *fuck* do mosquitoes exist, they should go extinct little motherfucking pieces of shit
