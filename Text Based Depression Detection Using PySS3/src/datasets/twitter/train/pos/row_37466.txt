IM SO FRICKEN WORRIED!!! I have to see my dad today, itâ€™s been well over a year since I saw him. 

Iâ€™m scared heâ€™s going to yell at me, put his hand on my thigh (like he did the last two times) or something possibly worse. 

I canâ€™t stop overthinking!!! 

Fuck! Iâ€™m so stressed out rn I just want to hide!!!
