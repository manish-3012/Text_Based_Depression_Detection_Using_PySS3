OKAY, THIS SHIT IS DISGUSTING AND IT HAS TO FUCKING STOP! (he/him) Okay, this shit it disgusting, and it has to stop.


Stop sexualising women for every little thing.
Not just women, but men, and enbys, too.
Just stop making everything about sex.
It's gross.

Listen, sex is a NORMAL AND OKAY THING.
But- some of the shit I have read articles on, touching ANYONE without their consent, sexually, is bad.

I think for one, we need better sex ed. 
Teach us what is right from wrong; or we will turn to the internet, which gives us misinformation.  

Do NOT touch anyone. If they are your partner- okay, sure. But don't touch anyone- wether that be sliding a hand up their thigh, what ever. JUST DON'T. 
Especially if they are underage.

We need to stop normalising this shit. It's wrong. 

People don't feel safe walking down the street anymore; please make them feel safer, and spread awareness about this.

Do not approach anyone at night time, either, as it will probably scare the other person. 

We need to stop this. Do NOT send any nudes, to anyone.

Don't take photos of people without their consent, and don't post them any where!

Don't force people into relationships, either. If they've said no, they've said 'no'! Sure, you can be their friend, slowly build it up; but stop forcing yourself upon people. 

Stop sexualising- teenagers, kids, for fucks sake! 
I am 13, and I know us teens need to be taught that touching people inappropriately (without consent), is bad, and you could wind up in jail. You're probably reading this thinking 'well, I know this', but some people apparently don't. 

If you see anyone doing anything without the other people(s) consent, please report them, to a teacher, or some one who you trust. 




Thank you, stay alive, stay safe |-/
