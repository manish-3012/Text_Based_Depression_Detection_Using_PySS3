Having problems with a girl i like... Hey im 15 and the girl I like is 15 as well I really like this girl but we don't really have much in common I used to talk to her a year ago in history but during lockdown we haven't spoke. Most people would start to talk to her again but I have social anxiety and a little bit of autism so it's hard for me to start a conversation with her. I want to talk to her but I can't bring my self to do it since I fell like I would mess up and seem creepy I guess my friends say just go for it but I just can't if anybody could give me advice I would really appreciate it thanks.
