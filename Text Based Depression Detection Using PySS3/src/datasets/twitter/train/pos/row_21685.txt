You think youâ€™ve been through hell Until you get a #MOSQUITO BITE, **INSIDE YOUR &gt;!FUCKING!&lt; EAR. I donâ€™t mean in the flappy bit, I mean IN YOUR &gt;!FUCKING!&lt; EAR.

Oh my god, kill me please, end my suffering. This should be a war crime. 

What did the mosquito even get out of this???? Their isnâ€™t much blood flow inside the ear. This mosquito just did it to see me perish. What a fucking psychopath.

Itâ€™s fucking itchy, but I canâ€™t itch it, because if I do, it will bleed, and then I will have a bloody, itchy, ear waxy nightmare.

to all the mosquitoes reading this out there, WHY IN THE &gt;!FUCKING!&lt; EAR. WHO SENT YOU???!! WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ME??!
