Katy Perry Gush :) ***hey guys, gals, and non binary pals :)***

so I'm bored and listening to music and I've recently started listening to some old Katy Perry songs that came out back when I was little. anddddd I have quite a lot to say about them. :) nobody probably cares tho lol. but basically, I'm just gonna be gushing about her songs and lyrics cuz why not? if you're not interested, you can keep scrolling and ignore this lol. I'm open to having a discussion or gush afterwards in the comments if you end up reading my post. either way, hope you all have a great rest of your day/night! :)

so to begin: I absolutely love how the majority of her songs are about empowering women and just so motivational. I feel like I've always been strong or known my worth, so I was able to relate to her songs. and then other songs are just really fun! no big message or anything, just for fun! NOW LET US BEGINNN

**PART OF ME:** basically about how she's leaving her cheating bf according to the music video and talking about how life and people can be really crappy at times, but you shouldn't let them get the best of you. those people are miserable and sad which is why they try to make YOU sad and miserable. I personally can relate cuz I've been hurt... quite a few times throughout life by many people and honestly find it really hard to trust people now. but no matter how badly they've hurt me, I always, *always* bounce back because I know my worth and know that no matter how much they try to cut me down, they can't. nothing they can say can make me forget myself and my own worth, and I know that truly happy and good people don't try to cut others done or make them feel bad about themselves. whoever does anything like that is NOT truly happy with themselves or their lives. I mean, c'mon. do you really think someone who is perfectly healthy, happy, and good will try to make others miserable? **no.** I also know that if nobody else is there for me, I know I have my family to support me and motivate me. due to these reasons, I absolutely love this song :)

**HOT N COLD:** this one is another motivational song! I loved this song ever since I was little as well because of the empowering message in it. in the music video, Katy is getting married to someone but he gets cold feet. the song is about a toxic relationship, how one person doesn't want the person, but doesn't want the person to want someone else either, or is constantly changing their minds. the relationship started out great but started deteriorating. another thing I really liked was the lyrics that go like 'I should know that you're no good for me' and 'I should know that you're not gonna change'. I liked those because I feel it shows how in toxic relationship, people hardly ever change so it's honestly pointless to stay in those relationships. I know it's easier said than done to leave those relationships, so I'm not shaming anyone for staying in those cuz I know many people try to leave but can't. as I mentioned before, I've always known my worth so this song was motivating for me because when I date in the future, I know that I won't take anybody's crap. I know my worth and know that I deserve to be treated with respect, and I'll treat my S.O with respect, and the minute someone treats me badly or thinks that they can walk all over me, I'm out without a backwards glance. why should I waste my time on someone who doesn't respect me? there are plenty of people out there who will respect me, so I'm not gonna stay hung up on someone who doesn't. k *that* turned into a rant lol, sorry. basically, I found it really motivating and loved the lyrics :)

**LAST FRIDAY NIGHT (TGIF):** i looove this song lol. it's not motivational or anything, it's one of those 'just-for-fun' songs and I sing and dance along every single time. also, her voice sounds amazing in this song lol. i love dancing and the concept of parties, which I unfortunately haven't spent a lot of time at in my short 15 years of life :/ tho I do plan on attending many, many parties as I grow older haha. anyways, the song is just really fun and while the music video is quite crazy lol, I love it regardless and I can't wait till I'm older to have fun and be more independent as I have pretty strict parents who don't let me do a lot of things. that's another reason why I love the song: it gives me hope and makes me excited about the years to come once I get into college and am more independent. to sum that all up, loveee it lol

**CALIFORNIA GURLS:** ok, so this song doesn't have any meaning behind it really either, but I just always loved it ever since I was little... before I understood that the entire song was basically about sex and was full of sexual references O.O I just loved it because I'm from the state the song is about so I felt very proud and famous when I was little cuz the song was about where I lived lol. besides that, I just like the beat and think it's a fun song! :)

k those are all the songs haha. Like I said, I was bored and felt like writing about the songs cuz why not? and also, my family is most likely tired of hearing this gush lol so I'm turning to Internet strangers :) 

k, that is all byee ðŸ˜âœŒðŸ¼
