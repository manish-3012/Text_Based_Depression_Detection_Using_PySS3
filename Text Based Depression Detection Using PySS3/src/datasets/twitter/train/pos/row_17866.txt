Should I come out to the guy I like Iâ€™m 14 and gay. Iâ€™ve liked a guy for years and never come out to him. Recently weâ€™ve been texting a lot and I wonder Should I? I think he might be gay, but only because when we were 8 he had an idea and long story short it wasnâ€™t something most 8 year olds do, especially not straight ones. Heâ€™s one of the most popular kids at school ( I still remember the cuty who loved his legos ) so if he isnâ€™t gay I will probably end up even less popular than I already am. For the past few years I thought he hated me but after messaging a bunch it seems he doesnâ€™t

Should the flair for this be serious, social, advice or relationship?
