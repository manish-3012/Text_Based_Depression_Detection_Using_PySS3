realllly important question, allll answers welcome. Okay so im a 17 year old girl, and I met an *old* on a game we both really like. Hes 20 years old and We've been friends for a little over a year. We basically went from friends to best friends to boyfriend/girlfriend/couple/relationshipthing. Oh also we've been together for a almost two months, call pretty frequently, text daily, send eachother selfies, play online games together often, and live 1.5k miles away from eachother.


My question is, is it weirrd for me, a 17 year old girl, to be dating a 20 year old guy?


I know for some people age is just a number and blah blah blah... but its really not. And although I wont break up with him right now no matter the answers, it's something ive been wondering since before we got together and I've just gotta hear other people's opinions on it.
