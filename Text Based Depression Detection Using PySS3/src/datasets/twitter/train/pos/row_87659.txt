I'm the only person in my friend group who plans meet ups. The only one who hosts. The only one who tries to get their homework done before them so we can relax together rather than spend the entire time working. I'm just a bit pissed off. My district has a 3 day weekend this week, we've been doing online school so the workload is light, and I've reminded them about our movie date this weekend every. Single. Week. For over a month. And YET just today (the night before, tho we've already postponed a day) they say "I might me able to make it if we make it a homework party rather than a movie party". It wouldn't even be all day, we were planning just a few hours in the evening. 

They NEVER host, and I know FOR A FACT that there's less than 3 days worth of homework this weekend because WE'RE IN THE SAME CLASSES and they're faster at homework than me. 

And it's great because this is the one fucking time I actually need to see people because I got broken up with last week and just need the tiniest bit of emotional support. But NOOO.
