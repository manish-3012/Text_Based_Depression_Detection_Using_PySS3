I wanted to go on a run but my sister invited me to get bubble tea Which do I choose. I'm already ready for the run but she's my sister, I also don't like sugary drinks and will probably still end up drinking it to be nice to her. I mean I don't really care since like it's not like I'm trying to lose weight so ig it doesn't matter but also runs are nice and I don't want to need to change
