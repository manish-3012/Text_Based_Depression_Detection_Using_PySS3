Idk what to do :( My mum wants me to finish college but I am just so mentally drained. I'm halfway through the semester and second semester is always worse. I am so tired and tbh I've been skipping some classes because I'm so worn out. I don't think my school does this "gap year" stuff too. I'm halfway through my course. I know I should just bite the bullet but I don't have strength left 


It's so hard to find motivation when you wish to die and remind yourself that at least 20 times a day.
