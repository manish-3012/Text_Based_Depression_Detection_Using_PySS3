How should I tell my parents about my bf? My mom always told me about how she doesnâ€™t want me to have a boyfriend before college. 

Well, I got one back in June and I start college next week (figured it wasnâ€™t worth just waiting two damn months when weâ€™re both already ready for each other, plus Iâ€™m 18 now and I think I should be allowed to have one). 

I donâ€™t wanna be all like â€œoh wowww so I JUST moved in but look haha. he asked me out the EXACT same day haha! what a coincidenceâ€, so Iâ€™m thinking I should wait a bit. But, like, what kind of story do you think I should come up with? He lives two hours away from my campus so a visit might not be too realistic but honestly Iâ€™m up for any ideas at this point Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
