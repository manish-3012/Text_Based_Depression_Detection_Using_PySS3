Just kidding stories / status, do you also go through this? Dude like I don't know if it is like that in America but in my country many of my friends post on whatsapp status something like

"Choose between black, gray or white" and each of these options is related to sex. "Does black mean you would have sex with the first person who viewed the status?" or else PPP which means if the person would catch me, think about it or pass. Or "choose a number between 1 and 100 and I will ask you a question that will embarrass you according to the chosen number" And they always ask you to spread it by sending it to friends, it looks like a virus.

Worst of all is to see a crazy man almost getting married with 20 years on his back doing these posts on social media
