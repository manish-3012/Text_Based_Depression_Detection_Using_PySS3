Feeling numb I've been feeling numb for a while now.

I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore.

I feel like most of the time the smile i put up is fake around my friends.

When alone i often get angry or sad about things that happen or i self loathe.

Doing anything feels like a chore now.

I barely get any sleep during school days.

I feel unhappy and unsuccesful most of the time.

What do i do?
