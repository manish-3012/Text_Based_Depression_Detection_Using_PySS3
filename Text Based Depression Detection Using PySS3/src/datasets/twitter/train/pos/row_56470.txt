I wanna get some post karma but I feel like I have nothing to say Ok for real though this might just be my anxiety talking but Iâ€™m incapable of shitposting, I feel like whatever Iâ€™m gonna post has to be â€œworth itâ€. All for fake internet points too, I think I got a problem...

In other news howâ€™s everyoneâ€™s day going?
