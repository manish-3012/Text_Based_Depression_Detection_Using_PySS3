School Tip #8 Get rid of distractions before they become distractions

The biggest obstacle to doing well in school is distractions.

To overcome distractions, you canâ€™t depend on willpower. Few of us have the willpower necessary to fight off all the distractions that surround us in this digital era.

Here are some ways to eliminate distractions before they become distractions:

Turn off notifications on your phone/tablet

Put your phone/tablet in another room before you start work

Restrict your Internet access

Have only one tab open in your browser at any one time

Find an accountability partner as you make these changes
