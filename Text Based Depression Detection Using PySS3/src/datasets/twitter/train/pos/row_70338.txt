My Teacher Just Accused me of Cheating My teacher, who most of the time is more like a friend I talk to his jokingly all the time, just told me he believes Iâ€™m cheating, AND IM NOT. I know people cheat and Iâ€™m not going to go at you if you do but I donâ€™t. He said that itâ€™s fishy that I got 90â€™s on the first 3 quizzes in the topic but a 45 on the 4th. But this is ap calc itâ€™s a hard class! He also said I used tactics that he didnâ€™t teach and the my order of doing the problems was similar to how online calculators do them, BUT AGAIN I SERIOUSLY DIDNT CHEAT. He said he canâ€™t do anything because I doesnâ€™t have solid proof but like now a teacher likes me less for something I didnâ€™t do.
