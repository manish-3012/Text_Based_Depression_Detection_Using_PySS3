Short rant. So back in June my biological mother started giving my 15 year old brother THC products without consulting the right medical professionals about it. She gave him weed and a vape. I have lived with my grandmother since I was 8 weeks. I'm 17 rn. Anyways we have become really distant since then. Me and my brother have ALWAYS gotten along. We may have fought a lot but we still loved each other and we were always there for each other. So I recently tried to contact him on Xbox. He removed me and blocked me. Facebook. Same thing. I am already taking antidepressants and this is the last thing I need. I love my brother. And I fear I may not be able to talk to him for a long time.
