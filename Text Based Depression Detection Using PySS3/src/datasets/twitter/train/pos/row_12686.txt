hi guys i need to vent for a bit :/ ik i might be a moodkiller but id mad appreciate it if any guys could give me advice so basically this guy in my class confessed to me a couple of weeks ago and i also liked him back so we started hanging out. we'd share drinks, cuddle, and hang out in the library and it was one of the best weeks i've had in my life. these one or two weeks, he's been acting more distant. he'd always say he's busy doing stuff after school so we couldn't hang out that much and ik he might actually be busy but he never calls me at night. I'm in a discord server with him and his friends and he hasn't replied to my messages and never bothered to call me, and i saw he was in a discord call with his friends. ik he might want to hang out with his friends too but i dont think he's making much time for me anymore and i feel like i care about him more than he cares about me, even though he was the one who confessed. I feel so powerless because idk what to do. I don't want to drift with him
