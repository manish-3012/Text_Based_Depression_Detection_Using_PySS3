I feel like I havenâ€™t appreciated my parents enough We fight a lot and they really piss me off sometimes. At that moment I genuinely feel like they hate me and they donâ€™t love me. Itâ€™s possible to love someone but get really angry at them right? Like my dad gets on my nerves sometimes bc heâ€™s really controlling along with my mom. Theyâ€™re just very strict in general (donâ€™t wanna get into specifics rn lol.) They constantly shout and I just want peace and quiet. Sometimes I can talk to my mom for a real long time about random things and my dad doesnâ€™t express how feel a lot of times but yesterday he texted me this one song and I thought that was really sweet. I guess this is normal idk, I still gotta hide a lot from them bc theyâ€™d be mad but that doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t like being around them sometimes. I know they love me and I donâ€™t have anyone else that has stuck around me this long. I know my family HAS to but Iâ€™ve acted really badly and I think any sane person wouldnâ€™t wanna be around me
