I'm deleting reddit now. I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (most people call us Mormons) and I'm about to become a missionary.  I enjoy reddit and most of you are supportive and kind, but I feel like it's a distraction at this point. I'm deleting the app, not the account, and I'm deleting it tomorrow, so on the off chance anyone wants to say something to wish me goodbye, feel free.

Also please keep the comments wholesome and kind. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all please.
