(UPDATE) My sister spent my money and my parents are okay with it A few months ago, I made a post talking about how my sister bought a ps4 and my parents were alright with it. here's and update on that story.

so she got the ps4 in the mail a few days after ordering it, and its ridiculous that she wanted her own when I share mine with her in the first place. she has been playing on it for almost 6 hours a day and she is failing school. she has like one A, 2 B's, and the rest are C's.

for some reason, I can only play for around 3 hours even though I have straight A's. kinda dumb, but it gets worse

since she got the ps4, she has gotten to do less chores. I had around 2 hours of chores a day then, but now 3 hours. they said its because she deserves to play on something SHE bought.

my money. she "bought" it.

so now, she is basically failing school, playing for 6 hours a day, 0 hours of chores, and is happy.

I play for 3 hours a day, have 3 hours of chores, and have no money. I planned on saving up enough money for a next gen console. I've been saving since they said they were gonna make them. so not only do I have no money, I also just wasted a year of working to buy something I really wanted.

oh, and they are still saying its my fault that they had their credit card saved on the website and wasn't watching her while I was out doing stuff.

TL:DR : sister failing school, has no chores, and is happy with ps4. I play 3 hours a day, 3 hours of chores, cant buy what I saved up for after a year's worth of chores, and now sad.
