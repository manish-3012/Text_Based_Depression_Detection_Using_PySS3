Why do people from Europe, mainly the UK, keep shitting on America? I donâ€™t get it. The UK tried to siege America after losing the revolutionary war, and failed. Now they just try to make it seem like shit on the internet. I mean, sure, one or two of our states are rampant with incest and we have an idiot for a leader, but at least he didnâ€™t kill a princess bc she had knowledge that could besmirch him * cough Princess Diana cough*

Also our soldiers and supply lines are the only reason WWII didnâ€™t end differently. We beat an empire with little more than French reinforcement and and 13 states filled with freedom loving patriots

I just want to know why people think the US is a shitty place
