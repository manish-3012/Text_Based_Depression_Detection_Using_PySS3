Two Beers Larry came into my bar  
Every day to drink two beers.  
"My brotherâ€™s dying; oneâ€™s for him,"  
He said, his eyes full of tears.  


Each day it was the same,  
Two beers and then heâ€™d go,  
One for his brother, one for him,  
Heâ€™s sad but sweet, this schmo.  


One day he orders just one.  
His brotherâ€™s dead, Iâ€™m thinking.  
I asked him, but he replied,  
"No, itâ€™s me; Iâ€™ve given up drinking."
