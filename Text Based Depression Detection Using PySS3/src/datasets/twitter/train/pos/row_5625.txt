Being angry in video games. I've never really.went through gamer rage, in a public lobby, but in a game I'm extremely confident in(come at me losers.) I like to point out common mistakes that could have helped me, winning or losing. But that's besides the point. I don't get miffed often, but when i do, and someone starts getting sad, **it breaks my heart.** like I did that. I just made someone sad. How could i?
