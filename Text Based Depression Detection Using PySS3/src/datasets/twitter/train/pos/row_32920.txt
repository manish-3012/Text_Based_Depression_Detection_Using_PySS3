Hear me out: Schools should make study guides optional, or not assign them at all I find study guides pointless. Some students can read or hear something once, and remember it forever. For other sudents, having to answer between 20 and 100 questions and putting a due date on it stresses them out. Half of the question are required to be written out or looked up to find the answer. 

It's a study guide for fck sakes. Don't put a grade and due date on it. Your basically grading a students ability on how well they can study. If your going to do that, don't call it a study guide but assign it as actual classwork, and make it more than 5 or 10 points.

Everything on a study guide is just parts of previous assignments pushed together into one large "study guide" (summative paper in disguise). It takes me longer to do a study guide than it does for some of my other schoolwork. Not saying that every study guide in every school is like this, but I know my school isn't the only one where the study guides are like large test with dozens of questions and several pages long.

I don't learn anything from study guides. They're time consuming, educationally demeaning to students, and sometimes are turned into games like kahoot or quizlet.

NOW, I have nothing against playing kahoot or quizlet as a replacement to study guides, but no one really focuses on the learning aspect of them, just being competitive and playing a game. Kahoot was fun in middle school, but in high school you get quizlet. Quizlet is confusing to work, is fast paced, and is monotone in color, unappealing. It's hard to learn when everything is just so boring looking and hard to grasp.

Everything is all memory power nowadays. If you can't remember well, you didn't "study". And then you fail. Study guides should not be assigned, or at least make them an option. And definitely should not make them for a grade either and slap a due date on them.

I am done ranting. Thank you for listening.
