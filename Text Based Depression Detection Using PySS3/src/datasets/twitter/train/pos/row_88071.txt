I've been listening toi these lyrics for past hour and a halo on repeat, seems like a good start of the night Call list overflowed with hotlines  
Drug help, mental, $uicide  
Feel tired, feel dried, and you wanna die  
Pride fried, closed eyes, and you start to cry  
Swear I spent a lifetime tryna get it right  
Still isolated, still outta sight
