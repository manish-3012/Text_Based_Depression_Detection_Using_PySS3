Does this seem good for a first kiss? Iâ€™m gonna rant so here I go.

Basically because of quarantine I canâ€™t really do anything outside so I just stay online. I met this amazing girl and after a few days she caught feeling. I asked her out and we started dating. Over time we grew closer and closer together and now we want to meet in person. She wonâ€™t know this but Iâ€™ll be there at her house an hour before the new year. In the last 5 minutes weâ€™d go on her roof and look at the stars and the fireworks. Once the countdown begins weâ€™d stand up, Iâ€™d grasp onto her, pull her in, tell her how much I love her, and give my first kiss to her at midnight of the new year
