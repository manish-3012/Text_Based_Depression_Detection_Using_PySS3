Third day of expressing my emotions to strangers through crappy poetry I blissful deception keeps the silence 

Hides the truth, buriesÂ  the violence 

All in preparation for mourning day 

Gather all my flaws and ship them away

Rip me apart, limb by limb 

The institute policies looking quite grim

The brim of a glass has shattered

My hopes and dreams are scattered 

I imagine a cloudless night with you

3 stars and 5 moons

Until the world melts

And the lies are uncovered 

The world is mostly ugly

I need to medicate to hide it
