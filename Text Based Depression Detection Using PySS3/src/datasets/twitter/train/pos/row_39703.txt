Guys I have a great story to tell... Ok so this is a long story but im going to try to keep it short. 

So I've recently been showing symptoms or covid, so i decided to go get test. We went in, by we I mean my family, and have to wait for an hour. When it was finally time to take the test, I was flipping nervous as I have had a lot of surgery done on my arm, and so im scared of things being shoved in my mouth, nose, arms, etc, i dont like things inside me that dont belong.  And so my brother and dad went first, and they seemed fine, so i was a little less nervous, heart still racing though.  Then she started doing the swab, for thoose of you who dont know they stick a swab really deep up your nose and swish it around. She took it out  and thats basically all I can remeber because after that I passed out...

How often does this normally happen to people?
