The sexual revolution and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race. Sure, it did let homosexuals have sex but the concequences have been really bad. 

1. Pornography, easy to get addicted to and is like a drug. Normalizing it has caused many people to become addicted and this is especially a problem with young men. 
2. Ageplay, raceplay, genderplay, cuckolding and other unhealthy 'kinks' normalized. None of these are healthy or good for a relationship. Cuckolding is racist and fetishizes black people. Ageplay is straight up noncery. Raceplay is same as cuckolding. Genderplay is just degenerate. 
3. Child pornograpghy. This is a sub-category of porn. Not even porn, straight up rape videos. 
4. Sex trafficking disguised as porn.
