Iâ€™m pissed again Kyle  is a criminal not a hero. First of the crimes he broke first degree murder, illegal crossing a state border, and illegally had a gun. He deserves life in prison. First of all he didnâ€™t kill them in self defense. The dude with the skateboard was acting for other defense, he said some one got to stop him out he is going to keep shooting. So he murdered two people. He is a hero, heâ€™s a criminal who deserves the death penalty or the life sentence. Sry to get â€œpoliticalâ€ but Iâ€™m just ranting about it
