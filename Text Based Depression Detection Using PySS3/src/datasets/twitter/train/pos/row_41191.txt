what should I get for my switch Super Mario 3D All Stars, Super Smash Bros Ultimate Fighters Pass Vol. 2, Pre-Order Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Minecraft

pros:

SM3DAS: I get to play 3 Mario Games I have yet to play, I can play them portably.

SSBUFPV2: Min Min, Steve, I can potentially get fighters from franchises I enjoy, Steve

SM3DWBF: a 3d mario game that I can play with my fam, a mario game that has playable peach from the get-go

Minecraft: the novelty of portably playing minecraft, a game I love a damn lot

cons: 

SM3DAS: limited release, need to get it before March 31st 2021, games are probably too hard for my monke brain

SSBUFPV2: I might risk getting shitty DLC like more anime trash, min min isn't that interesting imo

SM3DWBF: I have to pre-order it, might be hard

Minecraft: I already have minecraft, and it might be the version that doesnt do custom skins
