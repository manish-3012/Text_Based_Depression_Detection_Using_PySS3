I hate how the popular ones get the most sympathy/attention/etc. Popular girl wants to overdose on coffee, gets all the "we would miss you" "we love you" "please don't do anything" and this is all great.

But someone introverted? Someone that barely speaks? She even says on point "I want to kill myself, I give up, I can't take it anymore. Give me some bandages and a rope and I won't bother anymore" she gets nothing. Poor girl is miserable and nobody cares for her in her class.

And it doesn't really has to be this severe, but the popular ones get everything. In general.
