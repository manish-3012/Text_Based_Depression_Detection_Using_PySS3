I hate myself and my parents My parents keep yelling at me to do things, but when it's my sister to do the exact same things they ask her calmly. I'm an introvert so I don't feel like speaking about these things to my parent's, plus when I try to they say that I'm the problem and I should be better. I am trying my best, I think i've improved in being more organized in school and in general, I try to remind myself to be better and do things like make my bed in the morning. I feel like I improve a lot slower than my parents want me to. I keep saying that she is the favored kid because they treat her a lot better than they do me, but they say they don't have a favorite. I am a pretty good kid in school, but my sister caught up extremely fast, she has almost all advanced classes in 6th grade and I only have 1 AP class in high school. It really frustrates me that my dad keeps telling me to start a conversation and talk to people, i don't get how he doesn't understand that it makes me uncomfortable to do that, and I never know what to say to start a conversation or how to continue a conversation. My sister is an extrovert and maybe that has to do with it looks like they prefer her more than me. Maybe i'm just stupid and don't know anything about life.
