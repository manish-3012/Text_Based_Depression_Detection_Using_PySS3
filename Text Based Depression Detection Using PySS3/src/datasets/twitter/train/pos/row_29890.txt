My parents are nice but They have some insane rules. Like I canâ€™t have my phone, tablet or laptop in my bedroom after lights out. Like Iâ€™m fifteen and I canâ€™t have my phone after lights out. Like wtf is that. Before COVID, they made it so hard for me to meet up with my friends. They literally fucking interrogated me about what I was doing and who I was meeting. Like I donâ€™t know what weâ€™re doing, we donâ€™t go to town to do stuff, we do it to hang out. Donâ€™t even get me started on the fact that they decided I would go to a boarding school halfway across the country. Now all my friends donâ€™t live near me, I drifted away from the ones at home, I havenâ€™t spoken to my friends at school for weeks, I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to and Iâ€™m just waiting to go to college and get away from them. 

Sorry for ranting I just had to get it all out
