Would you rather have quarantine last forever or end right now? Honestly there are so many advantages and disadvantages to quarantine, I can't decide which option I would choose

Advantages

* Online school
* Can cheat on your tests and quizzes for easy grades, studying is basically non-existent now
* Can go on your phone / computer during class and play videogames, with 0% chance of the teacher catching you
* Can chew gum, wear hoodies in online classes, etc. a bunch of rules you don't have to follow now
* You're literally in the comfort of your own home, you can attend class in bed

&amp;#x200B;

Disadvantages

* rarely go out and go to places
* lack of social interaction (but if you're an introvert this can be an advantage also)
* have to wear an uncomfortable mask when going out
* have to go through extra safety measures (mask, washing hands for 20+ seconds, social  distance) to make sure you don't get covid

so which one would you choose, and why?
