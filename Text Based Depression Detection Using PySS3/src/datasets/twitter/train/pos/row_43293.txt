does anyone else get really sad/mad when they see people being happy saw a tiktok reposted on twitter of a girl going through what happens in her daily life and shes so happy and carefree. she has fun doing everything, has a boyfriend, has a good relationship with her parents. idk why but i feel like shit watching it and cant help comparing myself to her and how much i hate everything about myself and my life. ive never realised i lived such a sad life

i need therapy
