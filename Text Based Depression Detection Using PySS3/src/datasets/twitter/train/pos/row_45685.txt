I wanna break up with my best friend. For some back story, we've been friends for 6 years now. I met her in school, we went to different colleges but we still keep in touch and meet up since we live pretty close by.

Last week I went to her birthday party and she said she invited her other friends too. Her 'other friends' turned out to be some brats with no sense of propriety. They called my best friend's dad 'hot af' right to her face. Yikes. They made inappropriate jokes and.. I could tell they weren't a good influence.

My best friend... well, she didn't seem like the girl I knew anymore. I could tell these people were influencing her, and she behaved so differently from when she's with me. Before I realized, she was already becoming someone I don't recognize.

Should I try to knock some sense into her? But its not just one or two of her friends, its her entire circle that feels toxic. I don't want her to be friendless. I don't even know if its my place to tell her about these people I've met just a few times. 

Or maybe should I let our friendship go? I don't suddenly want to find myself in the wrong crowd. But I don't want to lose something I kept treasured for so long.

Tl;dr: my BFF from school now has a very toxic group of friends. Should I try to talk to her, risking our friendship? Or should I just let her do what she wants as I passively grow distant from her?
