I need help... I think Iâ€™m depressed, I donâ€™t know though. I have major anxiety. I fucking cry myself to sleep every single night. All I do is fucking worry about this one girl because Iâ€™m fucking in love with her cause Iâ€™m fucking dumb and want to make sure sheâ€™s ok all the time. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts. My dads trying to get me a therapist but I donâ€™t know what to do til then. What can I do?
