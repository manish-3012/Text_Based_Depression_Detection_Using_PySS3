A spider crawled up my dads butt. I was going to bed, then I noticed two spiders in my room. I'm  not a huge spider-fan, so I decided to dispose of them in the toilet. I get some paper from the bathroom, then I go and grt one of the spiders. I threw it into the toilet, but I didn't flush. I wanted to save time and effort by flushing them both at once.

 I go to get the other spider, but this is when the incident happened. I heard my father use the toilet. I get the other spider and wait for my dad to leave the bathroom. After he leaves, I go to throw spider number 2. in the toilet, but I spot something. Spider number one is... missing. 

I think we all know what happened. There is only one explenation for spider number one to be gone...
It crawled up my dad's anus :(
