So I made a post on r/depression and my friend turned it into a meme I didn't think he'd want to take credit but he did, he's u/HiddenImages, feel free to kill him in the comments. He sent me some hentai so we're cool now but oh man it was cringe, I'm going to be seeing that post in my nightmares

Sauce if enough people want it
