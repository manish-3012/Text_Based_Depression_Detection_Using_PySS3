**Growth is Radical, release the thought of it being linear.**

When we are focusing on something new; we have realized that a feeling, built up pain is time to be released and let go of, it takes time, **it takes work. Daily work. By embracing who we are in this given moment, how we feel and what we have learned will allow for what we want to come to this Divinely.**

Of course we all want many different things, from **Peace to Happiness, to Awareness of our Passions, Success (**which means something different to each person**) etc., though** through the anxieties, through the depression, through the passion, the motivation, the lack of motivation, through the pain, through the sadness, through **everything; We are Still Alive. Fighting, Pushing and trying to do the best we can daily.**

Everything we want will come to us but if we move with **Faith &amp; Gratitude**, what will come will be more then what we had **expected, tried to manifest or prayed for.** 

It takes time, but the most important part is to enjoy **the here and now** because that is truly all we have.

**Today: Get fresh air. Call someone you haven't spoken to in a while. Be present and enjoy this very moment we have been given.**

**I love you.**
