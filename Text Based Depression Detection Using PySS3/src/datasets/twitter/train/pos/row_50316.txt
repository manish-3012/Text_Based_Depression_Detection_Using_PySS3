Online school is legit giving me depression I have 0 motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and yet i still have to leave bed just to stare at a screen for 8 joyless hours, and then waste all my free time doing mountains of homework in useless subjects, and by the time i finish it, my parents won't let me play videogames and actually enjoy because "it's already late and it will disturb my sleep". And if that isn't bad enough, the second i mess up because of technical issues, both my parents and my teachers start yelling at me and punishing me for something that isn't my fault.

It fucking sucks. I just wanna stay in bed and cry, all day, everyday.
