Kind of a odd thing to mention but I wonder in what the average teen thinks about this. What do you think about dressing as different costumes? I will refrain from giving my own opinions on this. Letâ€™s say it was Halloween, someone wanted to dress like a Bob Marley â€œJamaican Cultureâ€ costume. Should they reconsider purchasing it as it may offend people of Jamaican decent? Or if a person of different race decided to dress as a â€œstereotypical southern white Americanâ€. I understand women may dress like men and other way around but how is it different for culture or race dressing up as the other? Iâ€™d like to hear your honest opinions since 2020 has definitely changed us.
