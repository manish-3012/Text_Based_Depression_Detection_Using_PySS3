As a male, crying while someone comforts you, even over a Phone call feels so good. There was a thing I was really uncomfortable with, it gave me anxiety like everytime I thought of that. 



My dad knew what happened but he didn't know it was such a big deal to me. He started talking about it over phone and I couldn't control but cry.




He comforted me about it, and even made me laugh at the end.



I love you dad





I really really love you.
