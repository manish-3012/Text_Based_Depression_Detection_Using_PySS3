It you're one if the people who's contributing to the all buildings matter hashtag today, you are the scum of the earth That's not what today is about, it's not funny to joke about today and the fact that there are people who do think it is funny is incredibly disgusting to me. It's not "dark humor", 9/11 is not a joke and it never will be.


I just feel like that needs to be said. People really have no respect and it's truly pissing me off. It shouldn't matter what side of the political spectrum you are on or where you fall period, this was a day where almost 3000 people died, how in the hell is that funny or politically charged in any way? It's not, that's the answer point blank.
