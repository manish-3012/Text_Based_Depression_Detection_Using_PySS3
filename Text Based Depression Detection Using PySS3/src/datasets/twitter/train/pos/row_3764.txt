tf I do now? I'm making a fb account bc I started college and I think it might be useful and stuff. I tried making an account with my emailadress, turns out there is an account linked to it already and now Im logged into it... its basically an empty account but the first name isnt mine, last name strangely is. TF I do now? idk how to delete this persons account and create a new one... or do I change the name since she aint got any friends or interaction on here anyway
