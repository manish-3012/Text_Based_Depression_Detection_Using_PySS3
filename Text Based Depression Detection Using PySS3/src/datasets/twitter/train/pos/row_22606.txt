I don't know what to do. Everyone keeps saying that life won't get any better than this, but in my view, I don't think it can get any worse.
I was 6, living in a nice town in Manitoba when my dad was falsely accused of touching my older sister, and my mom took me away from him,  after what I think is 2 years in prison (mom never told me when he got out) he was told that he had to stay in the province, but he moved to Ottawa. It worked for a while, after my neglective mother finally let me go back to my dad's after 5 years, we lived happily together for another 3 years, but, because of a broken tail light we were going to fix, the police pulled us over and took him away, some of his friends tried to foster me, but they gave me back to my mom's after about 4 months. its been about a year since he got jailed again and I don't know what to do.
I'm doing well in school, but I am definitely not doing okay mentally, everyone in my class hated me, but no one believed me, so they kept getting off free, while I got punished and told to "just stay away"
I feel like a alien everywhere, even around those I trust. I'm a furry but I know that if I told my (currently Shakey friendship) friend. They'd just freak out at me. I've been told time and time again that life just gets worse, if that's true, I don't know what I'll do at that point, my life has already gone too far down that if my dad doesn't get his bail soon and charges dropped, I'm seriously thinking of just running away.
