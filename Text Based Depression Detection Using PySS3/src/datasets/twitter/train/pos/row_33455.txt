Parents please. Every time we plan something. Donâ€™t plan something instead of it. Forced fun is not fun. We teens have a limited time while being teens. It maybe doesnâ€™t seem like we never do something. The only thing parents maybe see is us laying in bed. Maybe weâ€™re doing that but, thatâ€™s something we want to do. Weâ€™re not wasting anytime. If we are up late at night, itâ€™s not because we want to go against our parents. Itâ€™s because at that time our friends are awake, we socialize at that time. 

Donâ€™t take our phones away. Just because your parents didnâ€™t have phones when they were young doesnâ€™t mean that we can go without them. Today we use our phones to talk to each other. Without our phones we will not have many friends. People will forget about you.
