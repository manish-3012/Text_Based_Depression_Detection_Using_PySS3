The debate between anti-maskers and pro-maskers reminds me a lot of the flat earth vs globe earth debate... In the case of anti-mask and flat earth, both start with a conclusion (earth=flat and mask=bad) and try to scrounge up "facts" to support their idiocracy, I mean claim. These people have done no experiments and usually use Facebook as their primary source.


But for the globe earth and pro masks, most have come to their conclusion (earth=round and masks=good) because of scientific evidence and experimental data that support the hypothesis. These people learned that these things are good because things were tested and conclusions were drawn from the scientific method.
