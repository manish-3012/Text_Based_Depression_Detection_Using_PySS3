Well. I wanted to share my interesting love story (Long text)

This happened like 2 wonderful years ago, in my school a classroom-shift happened and I leaved my "friends"(not really) behind because of this, I felted kinda sad about that but I tried to socialize again white my new classmates. Then I saw her, she was not that "beautiful" to me in that moment, she interested me because we had the same interests on cartoons, we both liked to draw, basically we were the same person, then 3 weeks passed and I started to have feelings for her. But she already haved a boyfriend, I never meet him in person but he was really an asshole with her, until one point the breakout and she was feeling really sad and depressed so I started to motivate her to hold on because "if you feel sad, I will feel sad". 

Then I wrote a letter for when I would decide to propose her to be my girlfriend, I thinked that I shattered the letter but oh boy I was wrong, she eventually discovered the letter an we didn't talked like for two days, I felted like I messed up our situation but when we were alone in the classroom she proposed me to be her's boyfriend, I kinda cried a bit but accepted and hugged her, she still likes to remember that day, she describes it like "the happiest day in her life". Today we celebrate 2 years of a wonderful relationship, relation that everyone sayed that will not work because we are too young but here we are, laughing at that people together.

Thanks for your attention if you lasted till the end, we both thank you for your support!
