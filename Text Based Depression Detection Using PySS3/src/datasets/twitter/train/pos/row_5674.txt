I've discovered that I cry during sexual situations and my girlfriend left me for it. So we were in a car chilling in the woods and things started to get steamy. I got really emotional really fast and started crying. She said something along the lines of "why the f are you crying." At this point I attempted to explain how I never thought I'd be loved this much, but apparently I was already to teary for that. She then proceeded to make fun of me for a few minutes and then drive home. Then right when I think it can't be worse, she drops me off at my house and says "Oh, by the way we're done." And drives off. So yeah I had a great day
