I'm very annoyed. My mom has done this i times. "Oh, I'm leaving him ofr sure this time. I've been looking at condos for rent" and "oh, I promise you, I'm leaving him." What does she do? A week later she runs back to our step-dad. He has broken so much shit and wasted so much money and caused so much trouble. He throws fits like a 3 year old, blames everything on my older sister or my Nana and shares his opinion on everything. He is an alcoholic, political, annoying, rude, cunt. I don't get why my mom lives him so much. "He's a good guy when he isn't drinking" fuck off with that bullshit. It took you 13 years to divorce a drug abuser/alcoholic. I can't even trust my own mom and anytime my step dad is home its always stressful because you never know what he'll do. Right now they're at a hotel. My mom is spending the night with him. SHE FILED DIVORCE PAPERS. HE STABBED HER AIR MATTRESS WITH A FUCKING KNIFE. You know what she said to me today? "I missy my husband" SHE DOESN'T FUCKING CARE WHAT ME OR MY SISTER WANTS. SHE DOESN'T FUCKING CARE. I don' need a dad. I meed a responsible, smart, parental figure who can guide me to adulthood. Not an airhead of a mother who is horrid at choosing men and is a pushover. I fucking hate him but everytime she vents to me she always tells me how open minded and responsible I am. UGHHHHH I WISH SHE WOULD JUST GIVE UP ON HIS SORRY ASS ALREADY. MY FRIENDS ARE A BAD INFLUENCE? LOOK AT THIS LOW LIFE IDIOT WHO THROWS TEMPER TANTRUMS LIKE A 3 YEAR OLD ANYTIME ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING TO HIM. And stop coming to your 13 year old daughter for advice. 1. You never listen or take advice from people who give it. 2. I'M 13 I DON'T KNOW THAT SHIT. Ffs stupid ass parents. 

That's not how an adult should act.
