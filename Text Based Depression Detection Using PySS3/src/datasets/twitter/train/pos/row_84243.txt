I think i just had one of the most unique nightmares of my entire life. I couldnt move, i felt like i was trapped, i heard like those bee sounds, i felt like these bees were all over my body, i tried to scream, but my mouth couldnt make any type of noise, i woke up almost jumping off my bed, that type of bee noise, like a zzzz or something was stuck on my head, i felt like i was dying, does this mean anything? Idk, strangely i could only feel and hear it, it was like i couldnt see anything.
