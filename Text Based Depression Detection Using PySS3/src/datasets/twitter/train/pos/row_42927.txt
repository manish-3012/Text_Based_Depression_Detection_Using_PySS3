My dad is delusional So, my dad asked my if I (15) wanted to go hiking for a week straight and I told him that I have to think about it. He then said to me that EVERY other child of my age would be so happy to go hiking and everybody does this at least once a month. He doesnâ€˜t believe me that this is complete bullshit, so I had to make a post to show him that really no 15-year old wants to go hiking
