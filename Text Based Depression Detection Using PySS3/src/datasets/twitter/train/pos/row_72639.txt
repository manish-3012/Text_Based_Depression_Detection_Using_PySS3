Anyone else's parents just not giving a shit about their stress? But of backstory, I'm 17 and in my final year of secondary school which means I have my leaving cert at the end of the year which is stressful enough under normal circumstances, let alone when it's in a pandemic and we aren't even currently in school

On top of that lovely fact my parents split up in November, dad moved out after New year's and I stayed living with my mom and siblings 

So you guys can probably understand I'm going through quite a stressful time right now right? My mother however does not give a shit in the slightest, whenever I bring up the fact that I'm stressed she only replies with "what do you have to be stressed about" she refuses to leave me alone during my online classes and even though I have asked her to not let my brother play online when I'm in zoom classes ( we live in the countryside so our WiFi isnt great at the best of times let alone when he's online with his friends)

To be honest I'm reaching a breaking point, I had to email 3 of my teachers yesterday and ask for extensions on work I can not get done bc of her constantly needing me to do something whenever I'm doing school work

Today especially she's watching my niece and she's now demanding I do all my online classes downstairs in the living room (today's included) so she can "make sure I'm actually doing it and not sleeping" which means I have to try and do my work without my desk and have her baby talking the fucking child in the background

Any advice on how to not lose my fucking mind?
