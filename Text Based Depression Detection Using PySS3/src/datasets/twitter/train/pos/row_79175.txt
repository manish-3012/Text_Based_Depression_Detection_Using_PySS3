Why do we even need history? Every time I ask somebody they just say "If you don't know who your ancestors are,do you know who you are?",like,is THIS your argument? WHAT WILL CHANGE if we don't know? I just needed to read literally 200 pages of fucking history of Kazakhstan. If I know that Burunduk khan helped make Kazakhstan bigger,WHAT WILL CHANGE?
