â€œâ€â€â€â€â€giftedâ€â€â€â€â€â€ I really donâ€™t know where else to dump my word vomit. 
I constantly got pretty good grades throughout my life, got sorted into gifted classes and all that. then i got to highschool and had to actually study and iâ€™m like aight sure. took a while to get used to but sure. now iâ€™m basically failing math despite studying 3 hours a day for it. id label myself a gifted burnout except iâ€™m not really burnt out. i try, not a lot but i try. i barely listen in class but i try to make up for that by doing my own work at home. i always have such high expectation for my grades before it all crashes down and iâ€™m actually surprised. i feel like anything i get below a 90 means that im not trying hard enough, and i just got a &gt;40% for a project i thought i NAILED lmao. i have crazy high delusional expectations of myself and feel like iâ€™m headed towards greatness even though iâ€™m just gonna get a desk job or some shit in 5 years. my parents reinforce the shit out of my toxic mindset, and they probably have even higher expectations for me than i actually do myself
