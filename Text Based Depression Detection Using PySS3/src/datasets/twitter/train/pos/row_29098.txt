Teenage dude problems I am pretty sure my room smells like you know what, even though i havent jerked off in there in over a year, my friends dont say anything and neither do my parents, but i just to do not want to have the room that ever smells bad. How would i go about making sure my room smells fresh all the time, i know the carpets and sheets are clean, as well as the blankets, and i never eat in my room, but how do i prevent teenage boy smell?
