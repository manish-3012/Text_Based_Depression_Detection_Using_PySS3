Emotional Intimacy All I want is someone to talk to. Everyone at school expects me to be funny, and just keep it at that. I'm not close enough to my parents to talk to them about my emotions, and I don't have any friends close enough either. I would love a significant other to talk to, but it seems like if you have any other motive than sex nobody wants to be with you. It sucks, because I enjoy genuine conversation, but I have nobody to provide that.
