a raaaaaaaaaaaaaanttttttt (tw: grooming, molestation) see, the thing is, due to being groomed twice and molested by a relative, i am repulsed by the idea of sex. like it reminds me of being vulnerble like that and i never want to go through that again. but at the same time, due to being sexualised from a young age and having access to porn from the young prime age of 8, i can be considered quite a hypersexual person at the same time. like it's a problem. so this makes me very confused. and i hate being touched - i feel like i'm once again vulnerble and i just hate affection from most people. like when people, especially my brother, hug or cuddle me, i feel sick. but at the same time, touch is my love language. so when the right person shows me affection, i fucking love it. but this is a very limited amount of people. so once again i'm confused :D
