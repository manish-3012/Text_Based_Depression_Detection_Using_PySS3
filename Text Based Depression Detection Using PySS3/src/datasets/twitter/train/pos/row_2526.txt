Iâ€™m losing all my progress on weight loss Over quarantine Iâ€™ve been playing basketball in the driveway almost every day for about 45-1hour but on thanksgiving I fucked up my ankle really bad going for a lay up. I thought I broke it at first dude it hurt so fucking bad. It was just constant searing pain for forever and it swelled up and shit. Apparently I just rolled it really fucking bad and itâ€™s still fucked and I havenâ€™t exercised in like two and a half weeks and I can tell Iâ€™m rapidly gaining weight again. Itâ€™s so fucking annoying. Now itâ€™s healed to the point where I can walk fine most of the time. Stairs can be scary sometimes but not too often, but running and jumping hurt so much and I donâ€™t wanna fuck it up again. It also doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™ve been gorging myself since my mom keeps buying so many snacks.
