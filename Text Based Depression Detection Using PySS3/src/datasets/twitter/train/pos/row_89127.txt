i wrote some shit Remember:  

You are just like a single grain of sand in the Sahara Desert, or like a single molecule of H2O in the Caspian Sea.    
     
You aren't standing out, you just create it with billions of others. No one's going to care for you, because there are billions of others like you.

But if not you, and billions of others like you, it wouldn't even exist. You aren't meaningless. :D

***HOLY SHIT I JUST CHECKED THERE ARE " approximately 1.504 septillion grains of sand." IN THE SAHARA DESERT***
