Suicide and self harm is overrated Ok, I know I'm about to get blown up but I'm doing it anyways. Suicide is fucking stupid, just flat out stupid. Its the pussy's way out of an obstacle, it's just you saying you can't do something. If you fall over and over again, do you pussy out and give up after a while, or do you just get up and keep pushing till you get it. So what happens when there's a rough patch in life. You get through it, I've lived in some pretty tough conditions and  I didn't pussy out and kill myself because I thought it wasn't get better. I got up and kept pushing and now everything is fine. If you need fucking help just say it. Don't be a pussy.

Here's my opinion on self harm. Why would you hurt yourself? Do you like the pain? If thats how you cope with messing up than I dont know what to tell ya. One of my coping methods when I'm pissed the fuck off, I like to run the fuck off and yell if I'm that mad. I don't hurt myself like a little bitch. Instead of hurting yourself, hurt anything thing. Like a punching bag, or you pillow take your rage out on that. Not yourself.

Say what you want, I don't care.
