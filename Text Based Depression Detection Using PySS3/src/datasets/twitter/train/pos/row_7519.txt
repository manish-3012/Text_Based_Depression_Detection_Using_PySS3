Frick physicals All they do at mine is look at you butt-naked. No questions about drugs, sex life, etc. No tests, no cancer screenings. Nothing.  They get up close and personal just to be like â€œokay yep, youâ€™re definitely going through pubertyâ€ and then tell your parents about it. VERY NECESSARY.

Its not even for my sports since they got cancelled this fall.
