Let my friend fly my drone, he lost it. What should I do? The drone is worth at least 175, he's a beginner who has flown other drones before. He just literally took off flying away and when I told him to cut throttle I don't even know if he did. He said "sry about that- the drone" that's all, didn't even bother to pay for some of it. Now he's offering $50 after I lost my only drone and my mom got mad at me for letting him fly it.
