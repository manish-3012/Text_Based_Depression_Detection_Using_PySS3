Being unsure as always... I was about to FINALLY go to sleep but realized something. MY CRUSH LIKED ME GOD DAMNIT. She literally held my hand ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. She cried on my shoulder... I wish she would have said something. I am in a new area now. Hope is lost... Welp. Hope yall out there are doing better!
