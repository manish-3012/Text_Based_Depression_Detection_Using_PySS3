Disgusted by the transphobia I woke up and saw a sweet post about a trans girl coming out to her supportive mom and it was nice. But a lot of the comments were transphobic and just awful and disgusting, so please if you were some of the people that left the bad comments, get yourself educated.

Yes there is more than 2 genders.

Yes gender is a spectrum.

The reason the suicide attemp rate is so high is becuz of transphobic people making the trans people feel like shit.

*TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS*
