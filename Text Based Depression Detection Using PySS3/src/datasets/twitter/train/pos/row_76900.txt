Getting flamed in every aspect of my life after calling this girl an attention seeking bitch to her face. This girl that goes to my school is one of those that romanticizes mental illnesses, and talks about her being bullied whilst making othersâ€™ lives fucking awful. She pulled a stunt on Friday saying last night she tried to commit suicide. She has newly formed scars on her wrists and position her arms in ways in which it would show it off.

First off, why would you go to school the DAY AFTER you attempted to commit, and ALSO why would you TELL EVERYONE WHAT HAPPENED?

Hereâ€™s my backstory; I lost a friend in January to suicide, and almost lost a friend to suicide in September who is now paralyzed, so suicide is a very sensitive topic to me.

I go to the parking lot right? And I see this girl wiping the makeup OFF OF HER WRISTS. I went out of line here but I hit her door and started calling her a fucking attention seeking bitch.

Then on her instagram story she posted about 20 panels of her crying and saying how traumatic today was and tagged me. I have been getting so much hate recently. Fuck everything lmao.
