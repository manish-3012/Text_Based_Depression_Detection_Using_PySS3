Why do I to feel bad every time I see someone I know smoking? *I don't actually know if this is the right place for this, but I am 18 and I have been experiencing this since ever, and I think that here maybe there is someone else that experiences the same.*

Every time that I find out that a friend or a person whom I admire, I like, or I feel comfortable with, smokes, I feel very bad for him/her and that inevitably changes what I think of that person, and ruins my day.

I know exactly what smoking can cause and I have never understood why some people start smoking voluntarily. My cousin was born with deformities of the urinary tract due to his mother smoking while pregnant, and that definitely changed his life even before beign born; thus I have a very negative perception of smoking.

Should I force myself to ignore that? Let's clarify: every time that happens I keep it for me and tell nothing about it, so I do not bother anybody other than me.
