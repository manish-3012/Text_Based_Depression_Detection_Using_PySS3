Why must I suffer like this? Last night it snowed, at the time I absolutely loved it, snow is groovy. Then a few hours ago I get hungry and decide to get some sweet sweet chocolate.

At this point a new game is downloading onto the olâ€™ ps4, so I leave the Student Accommodation in high spirits, unaware of the forthcoming tragedy.

I notice that the ground is icy, so I decide to go slow and steady, then halfway there it happens.

I slip on the ice and land right on my butt, on instinct I tried to use my hands to save myself to no avail. In the initial bout of pain I swear like itâ€™s going out of fashion.

Then to add insult to injury by time I get to the damn shop I found out itâ€™s closed.

Fast forward to my game having finally been downloaded, now I canâ€™t play it properly because I can barely move my left wrist due to pain, me mum thinks it might have been slightly fractured or bruised or something.

Fucking bullshit man, going off to the land of nod now and hoping that itâ€™ll heal up overnight.

Thanks for reading the rant.
