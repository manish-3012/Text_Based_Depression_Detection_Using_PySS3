Self-esteem Today I hang out with my friends. My very attractive friends. They are praised for their looks and their characters. They are beautiful in every way. I am the potato. The one that smiles awkwardly at the camera and doesnâ€™t know how to pose with confidence. 

They shower me with love and assurance. They tell me that I am beautiful and lovely too, but I donâ€™t really think so. I am chubby, I have a belly. My arms are thick and legs are hairy. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m beautiful. 

I smile anyways, as the camera is in front of me. My confidence slowly breaking and my anxiousness slowly raising. I stutter and cringe as I try to pose for the picture. My friends are having fun as they do silly poses, they look at me wondering why I donâ€™t enjoy it. 

I donâ€™t want to ruin the beauty of the photo, the beauty of the moment, with my awkwardness and fear of looking bad.

I love my friends and they love me. I love myself. But.. I donâ€™t like the way I look. 

After they leave and weâ€™ve said our goodbyes, I sit on my bed and think about why I feel terrible when Iâ€™m supposed to be happy. Each thought contributing to my sadness. 

Why do I feel this way? 

Why is beauty so important? 

Why does the standard of beauty feel like a goal nobody can achieve? 

Why?
