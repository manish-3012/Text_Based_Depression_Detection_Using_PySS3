Anyone think this way? Whenever I feel utterly defeated and just sad (which is often) I always think someone else is going through worse, stop being a bitch pick yourself up and donâ€™t let your brain push you around, I get intrusive thoughts and I have tics (Touretteâ€™s) my life 24/7 is constant thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m gonna say if you know what I mean, but I always remember thereâ€™s someone worse.
