Will Ferrel has such a recognizable, yet unnoticeable voice When you hear him talk while seeing him, youâ€™re like â€œOh yeah, thatâ€™s Will Ferrel, I know that guyâ€

But then if Iâ€™m watching an animated movie with Will Ferrel I cannot notice it at all. For example, in the Curious George movie, Will Ferrel plays Ted (the man in the yellow hat). I never would have guessed that.
