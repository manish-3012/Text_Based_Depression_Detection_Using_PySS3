I have a question for the femboys here, or just anyone whoâ€™s worn thigh highs before I have an outfit planned with a dress and nylons but the elastic/lacey part digs into my thighs. Like goodness gracious I created the outfit to be a hot ass bitch with my friends but I look like Iâ€™m trying to start an only fans at age 16. Please tell me how to get rid of that and have it not go into my thigh at all. Like do I have to cut it so the elastic is more loose? But then wonâ€™t it just fall down? I refuse to go out with thigh highs that dig into my legs because the guys in my town are disgusting, Pls help I can assure you Iâ€™ll delete this by the end of tn when I try out a suggestion and itâ€™s successful &lt;3

Donâ€™t bother with the â€œguys like it better when it goes into the thighâ€ you can take that remark and shove it up your ass.
