What the fuck, YouTube I have several questions

First of all, why am I getting recommended stuff that I donâ€™t watch, am not interested in and even repulsed by

Second, read the first

And last but not least, why is like 25% of my homepage ads and 50% of it polls

Like câ€™mon YouTube, ik u wanna recommend me something new and exciting, but you donâ€™t have to push all this shit in my face
