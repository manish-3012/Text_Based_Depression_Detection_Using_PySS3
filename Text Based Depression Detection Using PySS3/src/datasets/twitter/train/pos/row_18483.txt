Stopping chasing hoes is the best thing that happened to me, now Iâ€™m improving on myself 1 year ago I was down bad I really wanted a girlfriend or just to talk to girls but now I changed that. I got myself a job started dressing better, went to the gym before they closed and now will go again. I wanted to improve myself and I never felt better in my entire life. 

I feel good about myself for once. Gotta stop caring about others when they donâ€™t I improved on myself and itâ€™s paying off. I found friends that appreciate me for who I am. Despite this pandemic Iâ€™ve never felt more alive.
