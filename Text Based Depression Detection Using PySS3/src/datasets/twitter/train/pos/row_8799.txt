I want to start from 0 with my dogs. But i can't. I need to vent myself from what have i done, sounds horrible and.. it is. I need to post it with my main, because, if i use an alt, it doesn't work.  
So... When i was a kid (7-10) i had some anger management problems, why? Because my parents gave me chores, and i couldn't play roblox all day. Sounds stupid, and it is. I used to take out the trash, and filled with anger. I grabbed the home dogs, and well... Abuse them, stomach hits, grabs in the snout, so they wouldn't shout.  
Toby the new one (by that time) would get the worse. I used to grab him by the snout, and twist his skin, hit him, kinda kick him, it was horrible, and i accept it, IT WAS horrible.  
Maya the older one, already a fully grown adult, harder to hit but, sadly, not impossible, i used to kick her in the stomach, hard, with HATE. She would try to hide under the cars, bt she didn't fit anymore, and i went on and and on.

Thankfully, i stopped doing that when i was 10, and now, since i was 12, i've tried to get the trust they never had on, don't really worked until i was 13, i started going out to the yard more, and, they fear, started to fade, and that's the best thing as a human being i've ever done, i finally gained some trust, but. It's almost impossible to get them by 100%, i'm trying, but i can't.  


I really don't care about hate comments, i deserve them, i don't care if i get downvoted into hell, i deserve both.  
I'm  just glad they don't fear me.
