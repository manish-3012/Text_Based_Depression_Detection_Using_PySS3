comment your plan for your 20s mine is to learn academical subjects, learn how to cook well, learn how to bake, hit the gym, improve my appearance, grow intellectually and culturally as a person, obtain a healthy mindset and then let myself drown in sadness do drugs and die on impact after throwing my self off a cliff. Very quirky so what about yours?
