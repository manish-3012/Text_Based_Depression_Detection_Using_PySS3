I've seen all these posts about people asking out their crushes... Honestly not everybody always says yes. You cant always get what you wanted. But it's better to try then to just sit there and do nothing. 
    I had a huge crush on a girl that was in a club with me. I really wanted to ask her out but never got the courage to. Eventually we both quit the club and went our separate ways. I see her in the hallways at school sometimes and wonder if she even remembers my name. One of the biggest mistakes of my life was never just talking to her while I still had the chance. Shoot your shots while you still can fellows. Dont be afraid to take risks because you'll regret if you dont.
