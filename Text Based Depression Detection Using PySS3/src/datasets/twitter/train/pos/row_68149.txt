Parents want to know who supplied alcohol to my friends and I, and who's idea it was to drink and I don't know what to say. Me and some friends drank and got ourselves into some trouble with the police. We were all dropped off at 3AM to our separate houses, I immediately told my parents what happened. They want to know who's idea it was to drink, and who supplied it to us but I do not want to snitch. They say my punishment will continue until I tell them who gave it to us. What do I say? I'm worried that if I name some random kid from my school that they will call their parents.
