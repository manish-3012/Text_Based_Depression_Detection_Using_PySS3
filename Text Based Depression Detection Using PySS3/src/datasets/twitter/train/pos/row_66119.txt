I [17F] kissed my bestfriend [17M] and he has a girlfriend. Scared things might be awkward.. So my best friend is moving away for a couple weeks to another state and so we went out to eat together and just went walking around our mall for a bit (it is outside) for desserts, and a parting gift. 

So it was really fun, and things were just like how they used to be before he had a girlfriend. So towards the end we started getting more playful and touchy and when we got back to his car we made out. He initiated it and it was really nice. I wouldâ€™ve gone further if we had time but my mom was calling and doing a lot. 

When he was driving me back home he was acting kind of weird. And I texted him and he hasnâ€™t even responded. I kind of feel weird about the whole thing. I hope he didnâ€™t tell his gf. 

He has liked me in the past and I rejected him a couple times. And I ghosted him for a bit but our relationship has recovered. 

Is he upset with me? What should I do?
