I don't think im depresed but idk if I can be happy So I don't knoe how to format this but I'm going to start of by saying that I don't think im depresed but idk if I know how to be happy anymore, Every time there is a family gathering of sorts there's always a few adults(mainly the same ppl every time) that tell me I need to start making money, at 14 years of age... And that I need to make a company or sell something im good at, and the problems start there.
#1 I don't have time for myself, to be happy or to do anything I enjoy cause it feels like school is trying to kill us with huge amounts of work, by thinking that we need to do work on weekends and if we have distant learning (1 week at school and 1week home) that they don't have to do any work and we have to find all of the information ext. so I don't have time for anything.
#2 Whenever i think of doing something or selling something there's always this though in my mind, by being called smart your whole life you feel good or smthng but then you realise that your not smart and you only know a few things about a lot of things, not enough to make profit. And even If I do there is always someone who knows way more than me and at a much smaller price where it doesn't even seem worth it for me.
#3 Talking about school, when going to school from school my avarage daily sleep is no more than 4.5hrs(a lot of times much less) we have so much work that we have to study fore that i begin to start hopeless and think about working as a professional goat in the mountains, and tomorrow is my birthday (I hope atleast some of my friends remember) and I have to study for endless tests so I can't even feel happy on my own birthday anymore
#4 Whenever I try to be happy I start drifting off about subjects, companies ext. And keep thinking how fucked the world actualy is and how basicly everything is corrupt and i just go in a spirle unable to think about anything else and sometimes even starting to cry(I know it sounds dumb but I get emotional when I feel hopeles)

Thank you to anyone for reading this rant and sorry for formating.
