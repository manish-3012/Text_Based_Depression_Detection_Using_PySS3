Advice? Please lol Firstly..Sorry for wrong flair if that is the wrong flair..Secondly Enjoy lol..

So..Iâ€™m that type of female who is very quiet/Shy/awkward and just all of that..I also have two crushes (is that bad lol)..I wanna get close to them and just be more extroverted cause I want a social life and more friends..

If you were/are also in this situation how did you get over it/how did you be more social and such? I mainly donâ€™t like speaking because of my voice, I have a speech problem and itâ€™s really annoying so I hate it and itâ€™s hard for me to really speak and such. 

But yeah..Just any advice on any of that? (My crushes donâ€™t know I like them by the way, Weâ€™ve had small convos back a few grades but thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™ve been close to each of them a bunch and I just blush like crazy under my mask at least I think. Iâ€™ve thought about waving towards them but then just completely dipping out of that lol. I almost confessed to one of them but then dipped once again cause yeah- Were also in our last year so I might not get to see either of them next year so fun..)
