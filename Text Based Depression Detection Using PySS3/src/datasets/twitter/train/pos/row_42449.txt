leftist ideologies are whack almost every leftist system and ideology is pretty whack. just look at socialist countries. note, nordic countries arent socialist. vietnam is doing... average. venezuala is true socialist. ussr was not very prosperous. not to mention how leftist ideologies require people to seriously suppress competition. most of the time, competition is good, especially in a capitalist system. thats not to say all of leftist ideals are bad. more equality and workers' rights are awesome. but what is not awesome is robbing people of a better life with more opportunity.
