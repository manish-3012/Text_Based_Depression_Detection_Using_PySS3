I worry about my friend sometimes... I worry about my friend a lot...sheâ€™s gotten completely unstable and to a point where I always feel like crying and being a terrible person when I talk to her. I tried to help her, I tried to get her some help, I tried to be there for her...but itâ€™s not enough...

If youâ€™re reading this, stop posting on the styrofoam page and please, actually come talk it to me and we can fix this...seeing you like this makes me want to actually fucking consider being in a coma for the rest of my life
