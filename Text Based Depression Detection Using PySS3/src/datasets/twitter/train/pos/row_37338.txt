I am confused I have always thought there were 5 steps to a relationship

Knowing her -

Start talking -

Being friends-

Cuddled-

Bang 

But yesterday I guy told me that if I treat a girl as a friend ,then sheâ€™ll friendzone me (note I am on stage 2 )
So should I skip phase 3 or not , I always skipped part 3 in the past 
Because I am bad at keeping things going and I didnâ€™t want them and I to drift apart ,so what do I do ,friends or no friends ? 

(Btw I donâ€™t want the bang , but if the bang comes ,itâ€™s welcomed )
