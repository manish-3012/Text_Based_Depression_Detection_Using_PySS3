A post about people who comment "America is a continent not a country" every time someone calls the US America on the internet Personally, I believe this misconception arises because of certain linguistic and cultural differences between English and other languages. For one, "America" is not a continent, "the Americas" make up 2 continents and "America" is reserved for the idea of the "New World" at times or, usually, a shortening of the name for the US. However, the synonym of America in other languages (AmÃ©rica in Spanish, Amerique in French),  are the word for what in English is The Americas, two continents, and is seen elsewhere as 2. So, this cultural and linguistic difference causes mistranslation when these words are viewed as synonyms, because their meanings differ. So, you get people who falsely equate them and lack the understanding of the language difference and so see America as referring to what a native calls The Americas.
