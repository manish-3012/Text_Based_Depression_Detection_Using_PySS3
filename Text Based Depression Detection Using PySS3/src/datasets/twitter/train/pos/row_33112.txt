letâ€™s talk about my friend My friend, letâ€™s call him fred. Fred likes to blame me for things that happen in his life. The other day Fred had a breakdown and left his house at 1 am and told me he was going to kill him self. I immediately told my mom and we talked to him for an hour in a parking lot.

Fred likes to take his anger that has been built up by either abusive parents or his girlfriend, and take it out on me. 

Iâ€™m constantly putting up with his shit and I hate it.

Monday: was supposed to hangout with his girlfriend

Tuesday: was supposed to be with me, because Wednesday I drove to 12 hours away for family and Iâ€™m gonna be here for a week, so ofc I wanted to see my friend. 

So, Monday night he says: â€œbro (name) is being a bitch because I told her I donâ€™t wanna hangout with her today, and I will hangout with her tomorrow (Tuesday, ofc the day we were meant to hangout).â€ 

So I said â€œI mean yeah she has a right to be mad you bailed on her, also we arenâ€™t hanging out tomorrow?â€

â€œYeah Iâ€™m gonna be with (name)â€

â€œWell yeah I see why sheâ€™s mad I mean you just bailed on me and Iâ€™m pretty annoyed alsoâ€ 

He pretty much says sorry but idc

On Tuesday I get a text from Fred and heâ€™s mad at me, because his girl is mad at him, because Ik of the whole situation. 

Btw sheâ€™s also not the most nice, sheâ€™s also pretty toxic. 

She calls me annoying I tell her â€œcool we donâ€™t need to be friendsâ€ 

he text me Wednesday and acts like he didnâ€™t tell me to fuck off the day before.

Sorry for the staggered read, tell me if I should drop him.
