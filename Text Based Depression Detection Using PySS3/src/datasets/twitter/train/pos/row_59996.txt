How can I help my cousin out with his insecurities? Me (15) and my younger cousin (14) often talk about anime, life, and a variety of things. Recently, I've discovered this new side of him, or maybe the REAL him, that he is extremely insecure. In our convos, he says things like "well tbh i dont think i deserve ANY friends" and saying he doesn't deserve a girlfriend and he probably isn't going to have a wife. He also goes on about how he deserves to be insecure and how he's irrelevant and how I'm being too nice for worrying about him. He also talks about how "the annoying part is i have motivation to do their hw, but when it comes to my own it goes away . When ever I try to press the subject about his insecurities he just says to not to worry about it. Is there anything I can do to help him? I was in a similar place a few years ago to a less extreme degree and I want to help him overcome his insecurities.
