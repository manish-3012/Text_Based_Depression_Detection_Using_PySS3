Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 23: Napoleon Bonaparte Napoleon won 56 victories in the battlefield, more than anyone in recorded history. They called him "the Enlightened Monarch" because he showed values that no modern European monarch knew existed. He even saved the Revolution from the foreign invasions.

Y'know, before destroying it himself.

The wars that he campaigned across Europe led to the deaths of up to 0.65% of the entire world population of the time. 

He also had a killing boner for Britain. He had a plan to dig tunnels under the English Channel. When he remembered that science existed, he then wanted to build a big-ass bridge, then later, hydrogen-powered balloons to bomb Britian. Funny enough, that strategy was put into practice over Britain... 100 years later. 

Of the scientists he hired, one was an American named Robert Fulton. He presented a new ship to crush every navy in the world. After hearing of the plan, L'Emperor replied, "What, sir? You would make a ship sail against the wind and currents by lighting a bonfire under her decks? I pray you excuse me. I have no time to listen to such nonsense.â€

That invention, you ask? The steam engine.

Fulton also designed him a submarine which worked wonders in mock battles. The *one* time it leaked was when Napoleon showed up. He swiftly sacked Fulton.

His killing boner ultimately led him into the Russian scorched earth and then his fall.
