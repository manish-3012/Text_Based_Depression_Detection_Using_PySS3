I keep having dreams about meeting girls who I fall in love with. I'm lonely. The one I had most recently was last night.  In the dream, we had a new neighbor to the right.  I went over there to go meet them and welcome them to the neighborhood.  There was a girl there, who was beautiful, and for whatever reason, they had the entire ocean off of the side of their porch, which I didn't recognize as strange until after I woke up.  When I met her, she was sitting on her porch, looking out at the water.  We talked and laughed for a while, and she invited my family to come have dinner with hers.  After that, my family went home, but me and her stayed out on the porch.  It was cold, so I grabbed a blanket and covered us both with it.  She wrapped her arm around me, and I did the same to her.  I know it was just a dream, but I can still feel the warmth of her embrace.  I must be mega lonely to keep having dreams like that.  But then again, I haven't been in a relationship since like January of 2019, so, I probably am.
