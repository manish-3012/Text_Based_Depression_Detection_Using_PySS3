Would anyone be interested in joining a free speech chat? You'd be allowed to talk about literally anything, but I'd like to focus on controversial topics or taboos. It is not a safe space. Your ideas will be challenged and you'll have to defend them. Anyone in will be respectful, or be removed. Let me know in the comments if you'd like to join!
