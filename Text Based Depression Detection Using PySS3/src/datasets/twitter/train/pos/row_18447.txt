We all know that dividing anything by 0 is undefined. Even itself. So what would happen if it's possible to divide by 0? Obviously, (0 to 10^100)/0 = undefined. So we need to easily break the laws of physics. How to break the laws of physics? Simple! Give one half of a cookie to 0 friends. Although it is impossible since we live in a law biding universe of physics.

But what if we were able to give the half cookie to literally nobody? Several things may happen, the universe may crumble in on itself, a black hole, time just breaks, or on easier terms... Fall onto the floor since you dropped a cookie by handing it to someone that's not there.

There are equations that can be graphed out if dividing by 0, it will just either be curved and go up or down the y-axis to 10^100 and -10^100 (including positive and negative Infinity)

Luckily we're able to have 0 divided by (1 to 10^100) since it equals zero.

(10^100 = One googolplex)
