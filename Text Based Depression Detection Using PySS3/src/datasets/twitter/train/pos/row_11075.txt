My poor body image (f) Warning: eating disorder mention




I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even posting this, but I wanted to vent and see if anyone would actually listen or have some advice for me, and maybe it will be comforting for others to read if they are going through what I am.

I have always had a negative view of my body and face, since I was twelve, and I am now sixteen.

I have also always been considered skinny or lanky, not only by myself but practically everyone. I have thin arms and tiny wrists (which people comment on a lot). My shoulders are wider than my hips, and I barely even have hips, because I have hip dips and not very much thigh fat. Plus, itâ€™s just my bone structure, so thereâ€™s nothing I can do about this. I donâ€™t have â€œcurvesâ€ anywhere, except for my waist, and they arenâ€™t even prominent. Itâ€™s only because all of the weight I even put on goes straight to my stomach.

I think everyone is beautiful for so many reasons, but I am just not happy with my own body because itâ€™s not what I want for myself.

I want to be able to live my life without being called anorexic (even though Iâ€™m not, Iâ€™m at a normal weight for my height; I donâ€™t even have an eating disorder), and without being told that I look like I do drugs or something. Iâ€™m not often teased, but when I am, itâ€™s about my body. How lanky and disproportionate I look, how â€œprepubescentâ€ I look.
How huge my hands appear compared to my stick arms. 

I am not even the skinniest person in the world. In fact, I would consider myself â€œaverageâ€ or on the thinner side of average and I am just that. I donâ€™t feel special. I never have and I donâ€™t know if I ever will, because there is nothing special about me. I donâ€™t understand how I am attractive at all. I wish I could be physically attractive. 

Everywhere I look, I am practically told that my body type is not special. That Iâ€™m practically like a warped plank of wood. Itâ€™s not desirable, and even if it is, only creepy old guys would be into it (you know exactly what I mean). 

Iâ€™m going to delete this eventually, Iâ€™m sure, but I needed to get it out. This has been bothering me for YEARS, and any time I try to talk to someone about how I feel so ugly, I am shot down and told to stop saying such things. I just donâ€™t know what to do now. 


And please, no jokey comments that are aimed towards what Iâ€™ve said if you can help it, thatâ€™s the only way I know how to describe my experiences.
