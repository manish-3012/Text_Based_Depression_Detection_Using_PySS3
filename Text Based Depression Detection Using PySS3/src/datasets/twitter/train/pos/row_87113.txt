TikTok is good for nothing  I don't know who is using tiktok, but it is absolute garbage. If anyone thinks this is a 'Reddit moment', no, absolutely not. There are literal pedophiles lurking in tiktok. Both children and adults are doing stupid and fatal challenges. A 10 year-old Italian girl died doing the 'blackout challenge'. People are trying to cut their teeth using nail cutters, and come are trying 'skull breaker challenge'. A woman also did a 'Coronavirus challenge' in which she LICKED a toilet seat at an airplane.

Ah yes, this is music and comedy? Then I might be stupid for thinking funny is comedy. Cringe is comedy.

And people who do this think it will make them popular or it's cool. Since when did risking one's life is cool?

TikTok ruins friendships. Might've not happened with many, but this happened with me. When I was in 6th grade, my classmates used to sort people who used tiktok and those who did not. I was pretty much the only one who does not use tiktok. They always teased me and bullied me for not using a specific app. Don't f\*\*king tell me what to do.

I'm not gonna risk my life because it will be cool and will make me popular. TikTokers steal songs without the OC's permission and dub it their own 'Original song'. They say the each and every tiktok user has their own 'original ideas'. Nope. When one tiktoker does something and becomes viral, the others are attracted and they do the same thing. That's how many dumb and risky challenges are born on this cancer.

Sometimes I think Thanos did a mistake by sparing half of the humans in Infinity War. Thanos should have killed them all.

What started out as an app for everyone to show their dancing talent, is a Cringe Complex now.
