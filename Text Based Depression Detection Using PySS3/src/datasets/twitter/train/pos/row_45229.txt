guys this story is cringe as hell but iâ€™m so beyond embarrassed i read fanfic, itâ€™s a guilty pleasure of mine. i was reading this fic by my all time favorite author and i vividly remember it, i had a stupid bad migraine and was crying (because of the migraine) and had read the fic in the car in the parking lot of a nature preserve (the norton arboretum in chicago. itâ€™s a nice place) and whenever i finish a fic thatâ€™s uncompleted i save it as a private bookmark with the note â€œfin with (chapter name)â€ so iâ€™ll know where i left off. me being a dumbass using ao3 on mobile with a migraine so bad i was about to claw my fuckin eyes out left it as a COMMENT.  
 
and now my favorite author of all fuckin time responds â€œ*pardon-*â€ I FEEL SO BAD AHAHBWNDKCJHWBWB guys this is embarrassing for like 7 different reasons
 
and moments like these i hate that my friends know my reddit look away besties thanks i needed to vent
