Unpopular opinion/rant: Discouraging people from killing themselves is just virtue signaling in its purest form. When someone on a large forum says they're suicidally depressed... clearly, nobody actually cares. This is no one's friend. This is an anonymous screen name, and if the person behind the screen name hangs themselves from the rafters, no one is even going to notice. People come and go all the time. From forums, and, well, from life.
The way we cheer on those who say "Don't do it, you have so much to live for" and viciously condemn those who say "Well, you gotta do you" is offensively irrational.
And people pretending to give a shit is far more depressing than the objective reality that no one actually does give a shit.

That said, I don't want people to kill themselves and I do realize that some people genuinely care, but a lot just use it for social brownie points.

OK, rant over.
