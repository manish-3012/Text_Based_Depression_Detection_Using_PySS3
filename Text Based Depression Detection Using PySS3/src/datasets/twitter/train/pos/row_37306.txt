Hypothetically: I know a guy who knows a guy whoâ€™s anxiety and depression are through the roof right now and heâ€™s not sure why So this guy goes to Reddit for advice because he feels REALLY guilty for asking his friends for help because he doesnâ€™t want to burden them because they all have their own shit and donâ€™t need his problems too. What should this guy do? This is purely hypothetical ofc.
