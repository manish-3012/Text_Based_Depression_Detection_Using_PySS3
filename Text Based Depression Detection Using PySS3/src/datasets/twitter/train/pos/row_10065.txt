Have you noticed that fb is copying reddit ? It starts with auto play videos but I'm not sure of this one, then the reply in reply you can reply to replies and it's organized, that was here ages before, and the last thing that the group posts are showing the name and the picture of the group more than those of the op, which looks like subreddit posts
