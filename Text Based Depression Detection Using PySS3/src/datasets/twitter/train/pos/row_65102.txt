I got scammed by a friend, what should I do? So my friend invited me to join this company. He told me that I could earn money just by watching ads. But I need to pay $40 for registration fee and he told I could get 625 token monthly, 1 ad per token and you can earn $0.2 per ad, so I really got interested and he already in. So I decided to join, and later did I know that you can't get your hard earn money immediately, you have to invite someone in order to claim your money. However, you can only claim $10 per invite from the ads you watched. What should I do, should I tell my parents? The money I used is for my tuition fee, and the only reason that I joined is so that I can save money and have allowance.
