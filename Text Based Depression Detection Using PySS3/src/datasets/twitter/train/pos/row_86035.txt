Well now that I will probably never get to ask my friend out now I feel different about her Well, so basically it turns out another one of my friends has asked her out. A different friend did so a few months ago. I don't know what's up with this next one. Well, for a long time I've been denying that I liked her but now for some reason the fact that I'm never even going to get a chance to ask her out just makes me feel sad. I guess I really did like her. But I guess all things must come to pass.
