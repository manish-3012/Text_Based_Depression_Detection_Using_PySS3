What the fuck has Spotify done to my recommended. I just opened my recommended in Spotify and it was completely fucked.

My recommended for today:

The Home Depot Beat

Squidward's Tikiland

Minecraft: Netherland Update Soundtrack

What Am I Supposed To Do

Little Runmo soundtrack

The Seventh Time (Katerino's Song)

Mandelorian: Chapter 1


What the fuck is this shit. And why the fuck is Home Depot Beat on Spotify? I donâ€™t know why this has me so mad, but it does.
