Anyone else see the problem here? Students with high grades usually already know about what's being taught. Students with average grades usually learn about the material as it's taught. In the end both parties know the material, but one party is penalised for not knowing it beforehand. May I remind you that teaching students about what they don't know is ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR SCHOOLS EXISTENCE. So summing it up, the reason we have school is to educate students about what they don't know and yet they also use a grading system that penalises you for not knowing material beforehand. Does anyone see a problem with this?
