I got a 20% on a math midterm, somehow! I REALLY thought I'd get at least a 70% on my midterm. I was so confident!!! I screwed up really hard and this is probably the worst mark I've ever gotten on a test so I'm down in the shitter mentally. It's really overwhelming, to the point where I want to just want to curl up on my bed and sleep for an eternity.

I withdrew from the course but I still feel horrible. I wanted to be a teacher but because I am so shit at math, I doubt I can pursue this career any further so I'm also a bit lost in the grand "scheme" of things.

It felt good to type that out :) College life is rough.
