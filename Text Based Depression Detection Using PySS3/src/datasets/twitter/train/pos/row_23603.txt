itâ€™s my 18th bday and my closest friends forgot my best friends didnâ€™t even bother to send me a message, even just a short one. for all their birthdays i posted instagram stories to greet them and they do it too to each other but not for me. ik this isnâ€™t a big deal for some but it kinda is for me, especially since itâ€™s my 18th bday (turning 18 is a big deal from where i live) :&lt; thereâ€™s no word to describe how i feel rn
