Why I think the education system is a scam Disclaimer: take everything with a grain of salt


First off we don't get enough sleep, the older we are the longer we want to sleep, resulting in not paying attention in classes. Us humans, not being able to concentrate for more than 90 minutes maximum adds to this effect. You see forcing us to learn is not something we humans want, it's the feeling of freedom that motivates us on doing whatever we want. Also the other reason why the education system is going to fail is because of people having some sort of superiority complex because their older and think it's embarrassing to even feel like losing to people younger then themselves. Teachers also do not get enough funding to get a better mic, what I think can really help people learn is calm voices, if you came asking me sounding like a crackhead about what the fuck the fucking powerhouse of the fucking cell is I would probably feel like I'm more forced to do this shit. Teaching also haven't changed in like a lot of years. Now there's the internet where you can just find whatever you want on Wikipedia tho for some reason teachers deemed it as a untrustworthy website for some reason so either people are gonna think that teacher is a dumb bitch or their gonna trust the teacher and maybe find fake information somewhere else. The education system really makes us feel more like we're taught to not be in the way of adults rather than being respectful to them(probably to satisfy their ego after seeing how a 14 year old dick is bigger than he'll ever dream of) it feels more like we're growing up just for other people rather than pursuing what we really want.
