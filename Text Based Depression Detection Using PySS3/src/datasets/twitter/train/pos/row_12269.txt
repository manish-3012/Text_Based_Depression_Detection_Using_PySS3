I am trying to become better friends with my class Because of Corona my class has been split in two groups. It's my last year of school and I'm barely acquaintances with them. They are all a large friends group and idk how to approach them. I'm bad at speaking to people, especially if they are a different gender which makes up for half of the group. Please help.
