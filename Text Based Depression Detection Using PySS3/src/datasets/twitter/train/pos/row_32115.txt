To everyone here: How do any of you stop procrastinating? I'm currently in school and all my grades are abysmal. I'm barely scraping by in terms of passing my classes and it's not because I'm a dumb student or anything I just procrastinate on all my assignments and eventually I just straight up don't do them. This problem is already out of hand as the only reason why I join classes is to be there for attendance but as soon as I join I immediately just mute the tab. I'm scared that if I don't find a solution to stop I'm going to just completely fail all my classes. So for anyone that's been in the same situation as me how do any of you stop this? I really don't want to fail my classes (duh) and this year is really important for me since this year is what decides which classes I go to for high school and I really don't want to go to a sub basic class. My parents have also been yelling at me about this problem since as far as I can remember.
