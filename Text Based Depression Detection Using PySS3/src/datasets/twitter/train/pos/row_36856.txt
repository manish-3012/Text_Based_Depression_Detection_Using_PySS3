I'm so glad I have friends ðŸ¥º Get yourself a good friend. 

We (11th/Junior) only have school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Fridays are optional if you're called in. I came in today for a club activity that was canceled and I didn't know. I live 45 minutes from school and I took a bus here that won't show up till 2 PM (currently 8:30 AM). My mom is obviously pissed and isn't gonna come to pick me up because it's 45 minutes away and she has things to do. 

So I text a friend, THE MVP OF THIS STORY.

GIRL COMES IN CLUTCH

SHE'S ON HER WAY RIGHT NOW TO PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME HOME

GET YOURSELF A GOOD ASS FRIEND LIKE HER
