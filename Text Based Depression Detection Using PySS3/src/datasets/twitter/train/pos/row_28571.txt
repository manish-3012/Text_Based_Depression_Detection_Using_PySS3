I absolutely hate Gen Z. I canâ€™t stand my generation, everything from the bleeding heart bullshit activism to the shitty fucking tiktok trends. I hate the garbage fucking band kid esque humor too. Really, there are no redeeming qualities of this generation, maybe other than the fact that itâ€™ll prolly be one of the last one, considering gen z men and women hate each other.
