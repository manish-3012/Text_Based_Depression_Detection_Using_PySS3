iâ€™m just gonna list some stuff i hate to hopefully make myself feel better i hate myself, the month of March, S.A.D., distance, the fact i donâ€™t have anyone near me that i can cuddle without some serious effort, my body, my torso specifically, my height, the fact i canâ€™t pierce my ears, the fact iâ€™m still too scared of ordering clothes i want, the fact i canâ€™t think straight during my SAD seasons, any milk that isnâ€™t 2%, bad caesar dressing (too creamy or too vinegary), the size of my ribs, the long ness of my torso, the fact that no one is laying on it rn, my school, my grade, my teachers, my grades, capitalism, the copy pasted personality that applies to so many people around my age, the homework that iâ€™m behind on, my director, my life, my experiences and lack thereof, my shitty lungs, my tall ass head, my flat ass hair, how much i say without saying anything meaningful, my skinny arms, the non functional adhesives on my LED lights, cold weather, hot weather, waking up before 10am,  people not directly shaming me but instead just giving me really specific and indescribable looks, football (itâ€™s just boring), and looking for colleges.

if you want me to go into more detail about any of these i can
