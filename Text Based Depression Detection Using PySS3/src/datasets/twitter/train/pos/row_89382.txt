I'm waiting for Carson's Response before i pick a side. I want to hear both side's before i pick a side, Although it seems unlikely Carson could be innocent for all we know. I hate how people rush to pick side during the start of allegations like these instead of waiting to hear both sides.   


For now im unsubbing from Carson until he makes a response, if he's innocent i'll resub if he's not i'll stay unsubbed.  


Innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven Innocent.  


My apologies if i come of as rude in this post i kinda rushed it.
