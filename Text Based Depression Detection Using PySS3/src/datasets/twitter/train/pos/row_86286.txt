Why do people love shidding on popular games or some games in general? The reddit hivemind doesn't like fortnite or epic because .... fuck knows? People shid on minecraft for so long until someone big in particular picked it up again. Why can't mfs let others enjoy sum? Annoying ass mfs I swear bruh
