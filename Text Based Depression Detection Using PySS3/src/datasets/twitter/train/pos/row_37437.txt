I'm so conflicted on my view of bisexuals. I'm LGBT so like I want to be able to accept each other and not discriminate. I can't help noticing how problematic a lot of bisexual people are though. It's just like too many of them are way too far on the edge of being straight. I used to think I was bi but I don't want a girlfriend at all, the majority of girls aren't attractive to me, so I'm fine with my identity being gay. 

And ik you don't have to be 50/50 attracted to both genders to be bisexual. It's just the I don't feel like a guy who only wants straight sex and a girlfriend/wife, is alike me or gay or trans people even somewhat. 

And then this is more personally applied to me but even if a bisexual guy is seriously into both boys and girls. I just don't see why any of them would potentially want me at all when there's pretty girls, idk. I have small chances of getting a date at all but if it is possible then I think I have better chances with a gay boy than a bi boy.
