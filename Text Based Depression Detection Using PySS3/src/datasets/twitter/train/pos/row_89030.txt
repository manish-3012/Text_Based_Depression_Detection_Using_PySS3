opinions on the super straights?ðŸŸ§â¬›ï¸ yk the ðŸŸ§â¬›ï¸ people who donâ€™t want to date trans people and made a lgbtq+ sexuality (super straight) surrounding that? they have their flag and everything, and are mostly on tiktok. 

im not trans so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but i do think itâ€™s fucking stupid. i mean the preference is whatever, but to make a whole mockery out of lgbtq+ is so heartless and immature. like ew, grow up and mind your own business like everyone else.
