I normally don't need help on things like this but I'm genuinely torn on what to do One of my closest friends admitted to me that she was being flirty after I called it out and said that she was doing it non romantically in a way and has to stop now that I've discovered it, but now she's doing it again. I'd totally date her I'm not gonna lie but I'm confused on wether I should make a move or not, she's been saying words like babe to me and whatnot. She seems to sometimes speak to me like she's hinting towards something but whenever I ask she's like "you'll never know ðŸ˜" or when I ask more directly let's say this for an example "why are you acting so flirty again is there something else going on?" She'll be like "what do you mean be more specific : - )" as if she's waiting for me to make a move so we can get rolling. I'm not sure tho since the whole non romantic flirting thing, I need advice.
