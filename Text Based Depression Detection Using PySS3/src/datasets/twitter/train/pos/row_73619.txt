Hereâ€™s another one of my 3AM theories/ random bullshit So you know how poison types are weak against ground types in PokÃ©mon? What if thereâ€™s more to it than that. Poison can be described as â€œtoxicâ€. Toxic being a word used to describe mentally unhealthy people. People who are manipulative, impulsive, aggressive etc. So what if â€œground typesâ€ was just another way to describe someone who is â€œgroundedâ€.  Someone who is mentally healthy. Someone who is reasonable/logical. So, putting these two together, putting a mentally healthy person and a mentally unhealthy person together in a debate, the mentally healthy person would always win.

OR MAYBE IM JUST FUCKING STUPID
