So incredibly pissed off right now I was walking my dog, but around a quarter through her walk, I realised I didn't bring my phone. I didnt mind too much as I thought I didn't need it. Around half way through the walk, from a long ass distance away , I hear a dog whining (dog owners, you'll know what I mean). Immediately, I'm very concerned and try to find the source. This lady was walking her dog, and the more I saw, the worse it got. She was absolutely dragging it along, mind you the collar was on it's NECK (don't know the gender of the dog so I'm just going to call it, it). I mean like when it wanted to sniff something, she just dragged it along so it was almost choking, and its a very small dog. After half a second of thought I immediately try to discreetly follow this lady. After a while of her berating her dog for trying to sniff things (y'know, the kind of thing a dog DOES ON A WALK), she noticed me following her so she crossed the road. I stayed on my side, because it would be obvious then. While she was trying to cross the road, SHE DEADASS DRAGGED THE DOG ACROSS, EVEN AS HE WAS WAILING. Honest to god I was so fucking pissed at this point and even other people that were walking also noticed this, but didn't say anything. I absolutely hate myself right now for not bringing my phone and recording it, so tommorow I'm going to try to leave at the same time and see if I can catch her dragging her poor dog along. Will update if something happens. I also know she somewhat lives nearby, so I will set out a bit earlier than usual as she was coming back from the walk when I saw het
