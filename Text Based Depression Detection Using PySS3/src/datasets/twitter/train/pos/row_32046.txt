If you have a friend that's decided to change, let them be and support them It's not your decision on how someone else should live their life, so if your friend has changed, don't go ranting about how "I miss the old you".
If you consider the person a friend, you'd support them no matter what.
Sorry about this short rant. Enjoy the rest of your night
