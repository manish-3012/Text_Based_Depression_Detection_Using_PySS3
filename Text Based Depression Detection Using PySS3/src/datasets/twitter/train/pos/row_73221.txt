whats the point of living? this isnt a post about me saying i want to kill myself or anything, but wether i do or dont wont matter in a few hundred years. iâ€™ll just be a forgotten thing of the past. i would probably just kill myself if im being honest but i cant do that knowing how much my family would hurt because of it. with the chance of me living past my parents being likely i will have to grieve and suffer their deaths and thats something i think about all the time. im not worried about dying and it seriously hurts to think that one of my parents will die before the other forcing the other one to lose their soulmate, the person they spent the last 60 years with. in the grand scheme of things nothing i will ever do will matter and everyone i know will be forgotten. ill work a 9-5 job for the rest of my life not getting to do what i want and theres a chance ill be forever single without a family of my own. the only reason im alive is because of my family yet theyâ€™ll all die someday. there isnt a reason to be alive anymore and the rest of my life is just gonna be mediocre and forgettable.
