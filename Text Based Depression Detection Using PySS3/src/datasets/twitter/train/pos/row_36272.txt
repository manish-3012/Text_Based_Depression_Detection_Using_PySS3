So my dad just had a stroke So my dad just had a stroke this morning around 6:30 and was driven from his work home, my step-mom drove him to the ER where they told him he had a miniature stroke (so nothing too bad or permanent) but he was told to go to another hospital ER about a mile away. He's currently there getting tested and we don't know if he is going to be staying the night or not and we are not allowed to visit him (because of COVID) so I went with my aunt in town to go change his tire and oil like I was supposed to today. For the brief moment I saw him today he looked okay, but I'm still nervous. At least he didn't have it just 2 days before when we were camping.
