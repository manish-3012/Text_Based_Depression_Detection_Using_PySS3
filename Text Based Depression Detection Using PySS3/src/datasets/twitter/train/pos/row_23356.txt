Suicidal thoughts I'm in 9th grade and ever since 6-7th I've felt depressed exhausted and defeated and my main thing keeping me going has been my best friends I really only have 3 friends and we've always been really close till recently for about 4 months my best female friend ghosted me always ignores me and I never get a text/call back we've know each other since 1st grade and I feel I did something she says shes not mad at me and that shes just busy but I dont understand how she can be too busy to have a 2 minute conversation unless I'm an ignorant asshole  but recently (2 weeks or so ago) we met up in person and everything felt normal then boom I still haven't talked to her since and its ripping me apart inside
