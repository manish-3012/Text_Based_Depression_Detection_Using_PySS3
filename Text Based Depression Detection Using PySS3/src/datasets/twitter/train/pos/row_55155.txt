I just got friendzone. But it's cool. She asks me out of knowhere if I ever liked her. So I told yes. I told her she's been making me confused all this year....blaa...blaa..blaa. She said thanks for liking her. I asked "Friends cool?" she said "coolll". Little sad. We wouldn't work anyway. Next week of school going to be weird. (we are not in lockdown in certain parts of Malaysia)
