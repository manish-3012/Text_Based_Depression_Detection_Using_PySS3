Ight fuck it, random information about myself. I'm a 15 year old Filipino dude who lives in Quezon City, Philippines. I have brown skin and black hair (I have pic in my profile). I recently got my wisdom tooth removed and as a result there's a small lump in the lower left side of my face. My grades are slightly above average I guess. I also own a subreddit called r/vibeshop. It's a cool place where you can post memes and stuff. In reddit, I'm a rat king and my name is Ron, The Almighty Rat King.
