lmao my parents think taking away my phone and laptop is gonna help me not doing my homework. So my school gave us ipads and thats what some of us use to do our homework. My homework has been piling up and idk what to do but my parents have been alerted about this and now my mom has been on my ass ab it and my dad wants to talk to me when i get to his house (i dont want to fucking talk to him lol) . My mom thinks taking away my laptop and phone and just letting me keep my ipad is gonna help me. I use my laptop for almost everything and i use the phone for music and social media. Music has been one of the only things keeping me (aside from the ppl i look up to and skating videos) alive and my mom thinks taking that away is gonna help. 

If i dont at least attempt suicide by idk maybe March/April then that'll be a goddamn miracle. I was planning to get my life together by next week but now ig not lolz. I just want to fucking scare them by attempting and see what they do lol
