Will Dua Lipa's new song become the unofficial anthem to SpaceX and the new space race? When the space race it caused an explosion of space themed music. Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to The Moon", Elton John's "Rocket Man", and David Bowie.

We are on the cusp of a new space race. Last May American astronauts returned to space on an American made rocket and spacecraft. NASA is nearing completion of the Moon capable SLS rocket and Orion Spacecraft. Sierra Nevada is bring us a cargo version of the "Dream Chaser" with a crewed version to follow a few years later. Jeff Bezos just had a successful test of his new space tourism oriented rocket and capsule. China is building a rocket that capable of launch spacecraft to the Moon by 2030.

Just as "Fly Me To The Moon" became the unofficial anthem to the space race and the Apollo program will "Levitating" become the unofficial anthem to SpaceX and all the cool space stuff that will happen this decade?
