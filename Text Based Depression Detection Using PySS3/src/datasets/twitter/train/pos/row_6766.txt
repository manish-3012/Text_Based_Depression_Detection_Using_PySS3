im so close to ending it all my life has no direction. were all gonna doe anyways. I have so much pressure put on me by everyone and I just canâ€™t handle it. no one even likes me anymore. mental illness is ruining me. everyone left me because they think im an annoying piece of crap. I have adhd and when I explain that I cant help it they say im playing the victim and such. no one ever appreciates me. I feel like I do so much and no one cares. I feel selfish. I feel annoying and dumb. Everyone acts like im a burden. My mom is getting concerned. She keeps texting me (my parents are divorced and im at my dads house) if im ok. My parents are going to court in a few weeks. My grandma is shunning me because of my sexuality. I have no reason to live
