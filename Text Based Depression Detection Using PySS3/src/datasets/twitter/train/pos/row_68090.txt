What is your opinion of the "stereotype" that all redditors are lonely and will always be single? I see this kind of thing all the time and I just find it odd. Maybe its a joke and Im too oblivious to see it, but I wonder if those people actually have the self-confidence or self-esteem to believe they can get a partner. I mean, I have a boyfriend that I really love and I believed that I was one who followed in that stereotype. Now that Im taken, I think that everyone can find someone who they find special.
