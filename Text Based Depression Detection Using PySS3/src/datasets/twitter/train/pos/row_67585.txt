My teacher just died He was one my favourite teachers who passed away from a heart attack. I saw him just two weeks ago... 

He was a truly beautiful and hilarious man who deserved so much. Now all I can think about is how distraught his poor wife must. 

Now Iâ€™m just taking a bath listening to sad music bc idk what else to do. FUCK!
