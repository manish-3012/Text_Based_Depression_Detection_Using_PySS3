[UPDATE] My teacher is quite possibly a pedophile In case you don't know what's going on, this is the [First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ilz6z4/so_my_pe_teacher_is_quite_possibly_a_pedophile/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)



**TL;DR on first post** : My PE sir who joined less than two years ago has recently been rumoured to be messaging underaged (15-16) girls asking them about their personal relationships and wanting to meet with them _privately in hotels_. Eventually the girls gathered up enough evidence to prove what he's been doing.


**This is an update on what happened today so far**




He turned out showing signs of guilt slowly as the time passed. All along it were the students and ex students spreading the information as far as they could and earlier this morning, a few school officials did confirm that they have acknowledged the incident and would look into it.



And sure enough, he was quick to delete all his social media (which is essentially Instagram and Facebook for Indians) accounts and no one has ever heard a word from him since.
Fast forward only a few hours and the information had been sent to the principal of the school and he said if the rumours were true, the teacher would be immediately fired.



I'll keep y'all updated if there's more to come :)
