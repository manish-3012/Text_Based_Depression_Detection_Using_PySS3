I think Iâ€™m going through a phase right now All my life my parents have been very controlling of me, it feels like a nursing home or a mental hospital, where I always have to be monitored. in fact they are so God damn worried about me that they hardly let me be without adult supervision. I donâ€™t get it, Iâ€™m 15 now I can handle myself. Also most of my life theyâ€™ve praised me for my intelligence and doing good in school, as if thatâ€™s all that mattered to them. Because of this my social life was basically garbage, and I had hardly any friends since I put so much focus on school. Despite my ability Iâ€™m still very unhappy, whatâ€™s the point of succeeding if I donâ€™t get to live? I want to be more Independent in my life, and I want to take more risks. You would say they care about me, but if thatâ€™s the case why do they control me, like Iâ€™m some sort of robot or something. my parents are so controlling, in fact they get pissed off if I even talk back to them, how do I confront them about this?
