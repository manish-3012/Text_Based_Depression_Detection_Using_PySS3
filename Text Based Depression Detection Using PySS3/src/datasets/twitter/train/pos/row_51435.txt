Need computer help and don't wanna deal with my dad Alr so I know this isn't the right spot for this but a majority of you guys are computer whizzes. So I have an essentially brand new powerspec gaming computer. Don't ask for specific specs because I don't know them. 

Anyways, I have 465 gigs of space and it says that 357 is used. However, I have added up everything and it's not even close to 357 gigs. This is stupid. Does anyone have any idea of what could be going on?
