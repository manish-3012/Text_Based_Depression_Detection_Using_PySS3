My school is about to go into virtual classes for 9 hours a day Before Christmas break I was in classes for maybe 2 hours and they just gave us a bunch of work to do, but now they have it as a full schedule and you have to be in front of you computer for 9 fckn hours a day. Like how is this not literally detrimental to your health?! I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this, if you already do this, got any tips on how to cope?
