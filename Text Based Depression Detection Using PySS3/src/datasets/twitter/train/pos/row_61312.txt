Iâ€™m not really sure if I want to be in a relationship. On one hand, itâ€™d be nice to just, be with someone yâ€™know? I recently left my group of friends and so I essentially donâ€™t have any close friends anymore, so itâ€™s be nice to just be close with someone. On the other hand, it can be kinda hard being in a relationship and a breakup is inevitable and i donâ€™t think I can handle more emotional issue right now. I honestly donâ€™t know if dating would better or worsen my mental health. I honestly feel like iâ€™m not fit for relationships, I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d full â€œget meâ€ yâ€™know? Idk just a random thought I had.
