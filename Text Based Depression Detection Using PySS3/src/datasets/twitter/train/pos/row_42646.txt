Why are we like this Nowadays, we canâ€™t tolerate opinions that differ from our own. We go by different facts, and so itâ€™s impossible to have friendly debates or discussions. For example if I were to go on here and say Iâ€™m anti-vax, I would get hate. Hardly even arguments. Straight up hate. Just for having a foreign opinion. There should be no problem with believing in different things and feeling certain ways about certain things.
