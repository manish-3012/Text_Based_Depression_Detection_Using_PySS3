So we found weed in a school locker This happened a week ago, we cleaned the classroom lockers (yes we have them in classrooms) and besides old textbooks, we found beer and vodka bottles, a 3 month old sandwich, stuff like that. But when I opened one of the lockers, I found a tiny ziploc bag with some powdered plant, which we were sure of, that it's weed. Then we showed it to the teacher, and he just threw it in the garbage. (this happened in Budapest, Hungary in a high school, probably was some 12th grader)
