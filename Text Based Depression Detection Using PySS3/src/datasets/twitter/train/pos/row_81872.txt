Well I was too depressed to ask you guys this but here we go I have a crush whose in a relationship and idk if she interested in me or not (even tho she probably wonâ€™t) and I hate myself for feeling like this and I think even if she was single it wonâ€™t make a difference anyway so I was just hoping for some advice form you guys to cope with it
