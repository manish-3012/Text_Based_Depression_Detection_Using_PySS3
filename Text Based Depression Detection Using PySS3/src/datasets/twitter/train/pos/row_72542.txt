My strength is so uneven I hate it I have this grip trainer thing and I can do the full 90lbs with my left hand with no problem

But my right hand is much harder :((


Guess I gotta start beating off with my right hand now or whatever idk


If you know any way to fix this tell me pls lol.  Or suggest an exercise sub if you know a good one
