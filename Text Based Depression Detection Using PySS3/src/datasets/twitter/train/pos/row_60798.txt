Medical Panic I'm sorry, and I'm probably being overdramatic. But to cut it short, I drank around half a gallon of water in probably 5 minutes, my stomach's been hurting all night, and I've used the bathroom multiple times. I'm kinda panicking about having hypoatremia, does anyone know whether I might or not? I'm 6ft 135 pounds if that helps.
