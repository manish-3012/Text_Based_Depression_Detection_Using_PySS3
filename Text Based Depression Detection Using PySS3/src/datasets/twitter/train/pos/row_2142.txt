My best friends dad died yesterday and i dont know how to help him My best friend (A) lost his dad yesterday. He has 4 siblings (3 older, 1 younger) and they are kinda poor. The dad was in a hospital in Ohio but we live in New york so the family had to drive there. A and his younger brother (R) had to stay behind cause when the family left the mom told them it would probably be boring for them (they had no idea the dad would die) A and Râ€™s last conversation with their dad was on the phone. They didnt know it would be their last convo with him. Yesterday when their dads parents picked them up from my house the grandparents drove them home and sat them down and told them the horrible news. They have money problems and both the parents worked at low paying jobs. I saw A and R again today and me and my little brother (m) tried our best to avoid the topic and have a fun time with them. They didnt cry but I could see in their eyes that they felt like sh*t. I dont know what to do cause I want to help them but I dont know how. Can you guys give me some advice on how to help them through this?
