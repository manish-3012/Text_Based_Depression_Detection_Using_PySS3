Just because something surprises you or is inconvenient doesnt mean you cant benefit from it. Yesterday, my mom got am e-mail from my school saying that I need a laptop. Because it starts next monday, we were panicking because we didn't have one suitable for school. We eventually went and got a nice 400 dollar laptop for school that doubles as a tablet and can use styluses for drawing.

If something happens out of the blue that scares you, you can turn it around to help you.
