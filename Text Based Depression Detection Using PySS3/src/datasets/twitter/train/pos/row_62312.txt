I hate pissbabies bro I was in a subreddit, and someone gave this prompt thing right? And then I responded and got downvoted to oblivion. All for one stupid joke. Like bruh, I get yâ€™all are sensitive little bitches but istg what they did was just annoying. I said something about the friendzone and everything right? And then people got mad and said how â€œoh the friendzone is creepyâ€, â€œmen use it to vilify the woman for saying noâ€, or â€œyou werenâ€™t friendzoned, you were already in it.â€ So naturally I got pissed and went off. Some people actually took my side but you know what? They got downvoted too. Their karma went down because some people just get offended by everything that fucking exists on planet earth. I apologize to anyone who read this rant, and thank you for your time.
