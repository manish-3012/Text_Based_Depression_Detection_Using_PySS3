How do I make online friends? Iâ€™m (18F) kind of introverted so I havenâ€™t been very social during the pandemic. Iâ€™ve always wanted to have online friends because it seemed easier and less socially draining than irl friends, but I never know how to get them. Iâ€™ve tried joining discord servers and Snapchat groups and stuff, but things usually dry up in a couple days and I never really connect with anyone. Any advice would be helpful, thanks ðŸ˜Š
