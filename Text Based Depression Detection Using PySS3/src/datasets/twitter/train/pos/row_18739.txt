I can't with this... So I'm watching all the dragon ball z movies cause I'm bored. So far, I've thought they were pretty decent most of them. A little repetitive and stuff but that's generally just dragon ball z.

So now I got DBZ Broly: Second Coming and I hate it. Like firstly it focuses on Goten and Trunks as little kids and makes them annoying af. Secondly, it just feels rushed and thirdly, why the everloving fuck did they need to put edgy metal music in it? That just makes it feel more like an AMV (which are cringe as fuck) than a DBZ movie. I've heard the next one Bio-Broly is even worse and I'm not excited.
