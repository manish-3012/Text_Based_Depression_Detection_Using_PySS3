I am worried about my grandma I think that she is not going to end the year with us.

She is 93. Even though she has no major physical health problems, I feel like she is becoming isolated from the world.

She just looks really sad all the time, and since my grandpa died 5 years ago her mental health is worsening each day. She has practically no recent memory that lasts more than 10 minutes, if so. And by recent I mean the previous 10 years. 

She just says that she is tired constantly, and does not want to get out to the street. Her Sister started like that some years ago, and now she is 99. I can tell you, a potato is more active than my aunt-grandma.

I do not want my grandma to die but I do not want her to end like her Sister either. I just feel at a loss and do not know what to do.
