Notice me Senpaiii I have a huge crush on an awesome girl I met on Discord but it's nothing realistic ):
She's so unbelievably awesome.
I just wanna be with her so bad but know that it won't happen ever. I always feel so excited when she texts me and am worried that I might upset or annoy her (maybe I'm also spamming a lil bit because I'm insecure). I had only one real crush before this and it's nothing like it, its way more intense. I'm thinking of her literally all the time and how things could be if... I need advice and don't want to get even more depressed. Everything Sux
