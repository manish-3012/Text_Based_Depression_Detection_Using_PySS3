Posting Wikipedia articles until I get a girlfriend day three Panzerschreck (lit. "tank fright", "tank's fright" or "tank's bane") was the popular name for the RaketenpanzerbÃ¼chse 54 ("Rocket Anti-armor Rifle model 54" abbreviated to RPzB 54), an 88 mm reusable anti-tank rocket launcher developed by Nazi Germany in World War II. Another earlier, official common name was Ofenrohr ("stove pipe").[1]

The Panzerschreck was designed as a lightweight infantry anti-tank weapon and was an enlarged copy of the American bazooka.[2] The weapon was shoulder-launched and fired a fin-stabilized rocket with a shaped-charge warhead. It was made in smaller numbers than the Panzerfaust, which was a disposable recoilless gun firing an anti-tank warhead.
