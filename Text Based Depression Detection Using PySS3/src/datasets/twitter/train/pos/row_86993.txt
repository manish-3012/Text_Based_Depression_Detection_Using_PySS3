Why am I more energetic then the other kids Like I remember PE and we always ran around after running everybody was always tired but not me I also remember some kids saying they would just start running really fast I knew that wouldn't work because they would get tired really quickly and they did anyways after working out I always got exited I always love running around but all the other kids get so tired why can't they all just be as energetic as me?
