I've never hated my dad more than now! So a little bit of background, my dad is stupid. He went up to half of 6th grade and my mom didn't even finish 1st grade but she's way smarter than him (I guess that says something about the education system). But they lived in Iraq, not in America. Also none of them speak English, and my dad smokes. We've also tried teaching him the simplest common sense but he just ignores it and does it again. He can never learn.

Somethings that make him stupid are:

Â· One time when construction workers were building our house, one of them told him to "grab a glove full of cement" and they gave him a glove. Then he literally went their and opened the glove and filled it with cement then he gave it to them. They could not stop laughing and my mom was embarrassed.

Â· A little bit of background for this story, he's always picking his nose, ass, and dick and barely even washes his hands. Anyways, we had chicken and rice for dinner and for the first time my mom told him that he can put the chicken in our plates. Then he literally says "Oh I don't need a spoon to move the chicken from the pot to your plates" and he literally picked one up from his bare hand..... We had to throw that one away and my mom came.

Â· This one was fairly recent, it was last week. So he got sick and went to test himself and it came positive. Then he took me with himself to get the vaccine because he doesn't speak English. When we got there, I grabbed a mask and got out of the car, then I see him just going there with no mask. I asked him where his mask is and he straight up said "Oh I don't need a mask, I'll be fine" WHILE HE HAS THE FUCKING VIRUS!!

Now, with all these events proving he has less than 10 brain cells left, I still had 30% of respect for him because he works hard to provide money for us, he deals with 40% family financials, and..... Well.... He made us I guess. But THIS EVENT JUST FUCKING PISSED ME OFF!!!

This was like 2 days ago. Me and him were in the car in a parking lot waiting 30mins for something, then he gets a phone call from one of his friend. They talk for some time then his friend casually mentions that one of his friend is abusing his wife. (Note that my dad hasn't ever abused my mom) then my dad says "It's the woman's fault because her job is to stay quite, work around the house, and take care of the kids. She shouldn't be putting her nose in his business because she's a woman, she can't handle his stuff. She can't live without him so just be quite and don't annoy him." THIS FUCKED ME UP. His friend tried to go against him but he had to go so they just did a friendly "goodbye". I tried to argue with him but he just said that I'm just a kid so idk anything about this kind of stuff then he just looked at his beard in the mirror and ignored me. I. WAS. SO. MAD. My respect for him went from 30% to -40%. I told my mom and she just said "That's crazy" and moved on.
