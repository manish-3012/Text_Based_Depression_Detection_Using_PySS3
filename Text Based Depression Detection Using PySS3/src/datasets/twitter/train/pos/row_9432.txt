I'm not sure I want to "repair" my relationship with my mom. Ever. She is emotionally abusive, she sometimes physically lashes out at me, and only me, for no reason, or even if it's someone else's fault and I have nothing to do with it. She doesn't respect my boundaries and doesn't leave me alone and doesn't respect my privacy. She threatens me with things she knows will hurt me if I don't do something for her. She's manipulative and controls everything in my life. I'm going to fail because of her and all the stress she puts on me, not to mention my terrible English who only makes my stress worse because his class is too hard and he knows that, he acknowledged in front of our class at the beginning of the year, and he said he's not going to change it.

 Not so sound like an idiot, but I think I'm going crazy being around her. I can't bear it sometimes. I have contemplated suicide, but I have too many things to do, I don't have time to think about that. I feel like throwing up a lot of times from my stress, I can't think straight, I lose sleep, I think not good things. I didn't do anything to deserve this, I keep to myself a lot, and I would spend tons of time with her, but she tells me I don't do anything with her and I'm hurting her. My dad doesn't try to understand, he only comes in to back her up, and it hurts way more getting yelled at by him, I love him so much and have so much respect for him, but here he is, throwing away all the respect I have for him and show him and making everything worse. It's starting to hurt to love him now. Every day, I swear it gets worse. I know I don't have it nearly as bad as other people, not even close, but this hurts me, almost so much I can't bear it. I can't take much more of this


I know this is premature and stupid, as I'm saying this in the post as of posting it, but: thank you all the kind redditors out there, I hope you know you do help people, though little it may be, it's still help. Thank you
