UPDATE: How I accidently slept through 3 periods instead of 2 So, if you look at my profile you should find a post I made about how I THOUGHT I slept though my first period, was relieved, went back to bed, and slept through my second period. Well, I have a story for YOU!             
               
This morning when I woke up, I remembered that we had no biology. So I felt there was no reason to wake up at that time. However, my dumb ass monkey brain thought it was the weekend and slept through the NEXT TWO PERIODS. Luckily for me, I had minimal work to do and I can quickly get them done.             
             
I am rather really lucky or not lucky at all.
