Guys can we not use the will Smith crying meme. It is from him crying about mental health and using it as a meme kinda feels like a kick in the teeth about men's mental health. I love memes but not the will Smith one. Or any other ones like that. I don't want all memes about something bad to be banned just relax a little using them.
