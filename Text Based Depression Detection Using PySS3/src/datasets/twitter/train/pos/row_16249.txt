I fucking hate people who say "who tf asked" Like this is why I have social anxiety. All I'm trying to do is spark up a conversation or add something interesting to the discussion. Do people even understand how much it hurts when you try to say something and people just respond with "ok, nobody asked", "who cares?" "Shut up", etc. 

Please don't, it really hurts and just discourages people from socializing.
