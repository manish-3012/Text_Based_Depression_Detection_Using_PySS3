Grades are ruining my life Im an indian and my parents are really overprotective of me and always want me to do well, schools say to â€œnot let grades define youâ€ but my parents dont seem to understand what that means. I just dont get why Making a few mistakes, or not understanding a concept will judge wether or not you get into college. And why getting into a college will judge wether or not youâ€™ll get a job. I have 3 missing assignments and my parents have gone crazy over it. Theyre telling me to go through 20 pages of just worksheets and worksheets to understand one concept that Im never going to use in real life. Im writing this as quick as possible before they notice that im using my phone. Like they buy me a phone and when I use it, they act surprised and say â€œWHY ARE YOU ALWAYS ON YOUR PHONEâ€ and I just want to take a break from staring at a computer screen for 8 hours everyday. Im not sure whats wrong, I dont know if its my fault, if the quarantine and online school got to me, or if its just a phase but I hate it, and I want to get out of it as soon as possible
