My brother is way too addicted So the thing is my younger brother is way too addicted to fortnite, the first thing he does in the morning after waking up is turn on the par and start playing, sometimes during class and continues playing till evening and if I ask him to leave it for half an hour to rest he just gets angry and shouts. he gets aggressive and is addicted so *not to sound like a boomer* I took the ps4 and hid it for some time. Should I do that?
