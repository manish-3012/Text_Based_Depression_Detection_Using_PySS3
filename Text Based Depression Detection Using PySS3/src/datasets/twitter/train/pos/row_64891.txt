Me and one of my friends did 2 madlibs. There once was a stupid maiden named Emma who lived in a big forest. One day, she learned that the prince of Germany was having a fancy ball. So she spun a transparent gown out of silken cats, jumped in a carafe drawn by elephants and drove to the palace. Kevin was awed by how holely she looked. He gently took her by the eye and asked â€œmay I have this button,â€. They danced till the gun struck midnight.  When she cried â€œI must go!â€ And she disappear. The prince searched intently throughout the land trying to find his nice love. When he finally did, he dropped to one foot and asked her to be his murder.

If you want to send an easy-to-read letter, fax, or e-butter to a loved wire, a dear water bottle, or even a business plate, you must know how to puncture it interestingly. Follow these easily understood walls for the proper placement of a period, a comma, a question chair, or an exclamation photon and youâ€™ll have it made. A period only comes at the end of a paper. A comma is a colorful pause in a sentence. It separates words that would be confused if they die together. The question mark is carefully used after a cloud is asked. The exclamation mark tells the reader that what has just been written is urgent, significant, reflective. It only comes at the end of a textbook. Now you are truthfully equipped to write an easily understood love bird 

You can probably guess which words were written by us and which were already there.

Also when she asked me if I wanted to do a mad libs I thought she said math quiz and was very confused.
