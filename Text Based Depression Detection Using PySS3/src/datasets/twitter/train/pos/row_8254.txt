(TW) suicide, self harm, and other bullshit DON'T DM ME

This is just gonna be a thing where I rant about stuff because I feel like it and I care about none of you. I feel like my life now should be perfect. I have friends and even a girlfriend. But I don't really care about my girlfriend honestly. I don't even know why I started dating her. She's a dumb e girlfriend anyway and it makes me feel pathetic. I'm not actually happy. I'm just kinda slightly more enjoyed when I'm talking to people. But otherwise I just feel guilt for some reason. Even sometimes I feel panic attacks. I used to self harm with a noose and I had panic attacks after but I kept doing it for some reason. Partly because I deserved it I know but I don't really know anything else. I just have a lot of thoughts in my head. I just know I'm gonna be a failure so really what's the point in even really living. I don't really care about anything and I know my friends hate me and all that shit. But whatever. Don't even really know why I'm saying this. But again

DON'T DM ME

Have a nice day
