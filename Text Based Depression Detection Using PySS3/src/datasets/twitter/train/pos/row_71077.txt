I donâ€™t even know what to think rn Iâ€™d like to think Iâ€™m well off socially and at home. I have Friends and a social life. But these last few days I feel like I donâ€™t have any friends. I know people would be sad if I disappeared or something, but nobody wants to hang out with me. 

Everyone doesnâ€™t want to hang out, they say theyâ€™re busy or leave me on delivered. The people who I treated with support and kindness during their tough times are ignoring me in my tough time. 

I honestly donâ€™t feel like I have any friends. I feel under appreciated, I feel like nobody cares about me unless itâ€™s convenient to them. I know I feel sad becuase of my seasonal depression. But I know Iâ€™ve felt like this before it happened.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong or if Iâ€™m evening doing Anything wrong. Iâ€™ve done nothing but be as kind and supportive as I can be to my friends. 

Iâ€™m filled with doubt, I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re trying to be supportive but theyâ€™re busy rn. Or if theyâ€™re even trying to be friends or want to be friends.

Iâ€™m not really an insecure person, Iâ€™m confident in myself but this. It just feels another punch to the gut at a time when you donâ€™t need it. 

Iâ€™m writing this because I need to say something to someone, I canâ€™t let my emotions bottle up
