Oh so apparently i can say whatever i want, even advocate for the deaths of minorities, because of "freedom of speech" So it should be ok to say "all homophobes, transphobes, and racists should be lined up along a wall and shot in the head"?

Because apparently people can say intersex people should be killed just because they're born with weird genitalia? So this should be ok too?

Yeah fucking right

~~sorry lol I'm in a bit of a pissed off mood because people always make the excuse of "freedom of speech" so they can say some really horrible shit. It's fucking stupid. I'm not actually advocating for deaths here but I think y'all are smart enough to get it~~
