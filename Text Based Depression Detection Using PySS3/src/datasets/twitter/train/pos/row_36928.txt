Idk if people actually like me Iâ€™m a 13 year old little shit head that teen hag out with because my sister needs to go out with some friends. Idk if people actually like me or like me because Iâ€™m the only reason they can have a good time. Idk every time I come up with a joke it flops harder than a nba player. Idk if all my friends are trying to get something out of me because I sold candy before COVID hit and i have been only to text one friend and I have like 30 contacts, I need someone loyal
