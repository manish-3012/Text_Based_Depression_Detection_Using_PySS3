I and my crush nearly made out Actually one day this new girl Comes to our class. She was damn beautiful. She was only looking at me when she first joined our class, even I used to stare at her. One day we had sports event at our school. That day everyone were there in the ground. But I couldn't see that girl (my crush) so I kept searching, I didn't get her. So  i thought at least she might be in the class. So I went to class. Guess what, she was there. I got nervous she came near me she kept staring my eyes, even I did it. She came close to me. Even I went close to her. At last only few cms gap was there between me n her. When I went to kiss her, my mother poured water on me, and I had to wake up and go to school. But I never found that girl again.
