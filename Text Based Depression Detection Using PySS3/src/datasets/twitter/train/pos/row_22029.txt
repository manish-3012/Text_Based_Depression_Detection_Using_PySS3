GUYS I FINALLY DID IT I'm actually serious here. I've been in love with this girl for years. She had loved me as well. We had gotten together last year, but her mom is very strict and controlling and just toxic overall. She ended up breaking us up in January. So for 10 months me and her had no contact, until a few weeks ago. She told me last year that she'd come back to me when the time was right.....and she kept her promise. I knew that I had found my life partner, someone greater then a soul mate last night when me and her went on an actual first date. I picked her up from work and we  drove around and blasted music and screamed the lyrics like the two idiots we are. I took her to the very top level of a high parking garage (ik very romantic right), but it was at sunset and you could see for miles. There was no one up there. And as the moon as our witness, I kissed her. Then I pulled away and saw her smile, a scene I will never forget. And then I plugged my phone into my speaker, then asked her to dance. Then we slow danced to "it's been a long long time", the very same song played at the end of Endgame. Then we just stood there and with my arm around her waist, and her head on my shoulder, we watched the sun set, and saw the beginning of our life together. I stg im gonna marry that girl one day.

Okay thanks for listening:)
