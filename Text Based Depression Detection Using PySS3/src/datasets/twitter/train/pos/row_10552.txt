Can something be done about non satire subs that engage in and promote animal cruelty? Like this one

I just saw that you guys got a vegan satire based sub banned because they were posting images of dogs in satire posts and talking about eating them. Without using any graphic images and footage unlike actual animal cruelty subs.

I didn't realize that is not allowed on reddit, but it's strange to me that non satire actual animal cruelty subs are allowed.

i understand people have a preference, they choose to perceive dogs differently and not eat them. So i understand they get passionate about a sub like that 


But the whole point is that objectively for the animal it is no different, for the dog it is the same as for a pig, a sheep and a cow..

So if a satire dog meat sub makes people take enough action to get it banned, imagine what it would be like if you lived in a world where you see dogs the same way except dogs replaced farm animals and killing and exploiting dogs was the norm and was perceived as fine and acceptable.

That's what it's like to be a vegan, not basing things on arbitrary things, on perception, but rather being objective, and putting value on dogs for the same reason as putting value on other animals, because they're sentient, they have inherent value, it's not just about perception.


So that's why dog meat satire subs exist, in a way it's kinda helpful for vegans to cope with living in such a world, and to show the double standard in this world 

By simply replacing farm animals with dogs, and that sub only promoted 'humane' treatment of dogs too. All still satire. With no graphic images, videos, completely cruelty free, and it explains it all in the about page.

unlike certain subs..

I'm making this because if you guys are willing to put that much effort at getting a cruelty free satire sub banned because the satire is about eating animals you perceive as important then i do hope you can also target actual cruelty subs and achieve something good and helpful.

Thank you for reading and have a great day.
