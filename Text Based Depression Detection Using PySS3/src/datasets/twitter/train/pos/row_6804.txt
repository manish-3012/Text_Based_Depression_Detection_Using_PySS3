why does reddit shit on younger users e.g. 13-14 year olds. i see posts saying â€œimagjne being 14 or underâ€ or â€œyouâ€™re 13 why are you dating so youngâ€. in reality itâ€™s maturity that matters more than age itself and age should only be an issue if itâ€™s something illegal. being younger than someone doesnâ€™t make you less cool is what iâ€™m trying to say
