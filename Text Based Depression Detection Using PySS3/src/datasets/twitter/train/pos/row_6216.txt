Guys I made an epic shitty discovery It is about the 3rd episode of Re-zero that has been released.

At 24:00, the music you can hear during Garfiel's dialogue uses the same notes as [beauty and the beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02nFtebCkMw&amp;ab_channel=VesislavaTodorova)! (the cello solo) and it just makes me laugh because it means that garfiel is the beast and that's just too fun lmao
