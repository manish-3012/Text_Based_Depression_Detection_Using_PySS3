You guys ever just find someone you can talk to who makes you feel, free? Like, you don't have to bottle everything up anymore. It feels great but at the same time you have to confront everything you've been bottling up. It's hard, and I try so hard not push them away because I know I don't want to but I can't help myself sometimes. They're great, funny, smart, kind, goofy. I really like talking to them because they make me feel free. I can just, be myself. Don't have to fake anything, I can just be myself. And then everything I've been bottling up for years starts surfacing, and it's just hard. I try so, so hard not push them away and tell them what's bothering me but I just can't sometimes.
