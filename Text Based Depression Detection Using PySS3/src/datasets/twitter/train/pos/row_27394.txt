So someone I told not to text me again just texted me and I donâ€™t know what to do. I dropped him after about a year and a half of a really close relationship after he started smoking weed and being mean to my other friends. I see him regularly at science class but we never talk. He also has like tough family issues and I donâ€™t know whether to get him back or not. Someone give me advice pls!
