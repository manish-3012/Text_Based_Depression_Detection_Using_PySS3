Iâ€™m the person conservatives would call a â€œLibtardâ€ but iâ€™m pretty much being forced to vote Trump this year. I donâ€™t see how people donâ€™t understand that Biden is a horrible person and will absolutely ruin the Country. More than Trump already has. I hate this phrase but itâ€™s literally the better of two evils here. Trump is better at economics, interacting with other countries, and controlling the military than biden will ever be. Trump is shit at doing all of those, but Biden would be more shit.

Donâ€™t let Biden be president.
