My parents- Why do you and your brother never leave the house Also my parents- No, I wonâ€™t drive you anywhere because I donâ€™t like driving. And Iâ€™m too busy, donâ€™t you remember Iâ€™ll be out of town that day? I have a life too you know. 

Honestly I donâ€™t even know why my friends bother asking me day of if I want to do something with them. Stg I have to plan a week ahead and even then my parents could make me cancel after some random bull crap shows up. If you have a stay at home parent youâ€™re automatically at an advantage in life smh.
