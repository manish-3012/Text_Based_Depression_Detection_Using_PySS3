My grandma just died So, my dad's mom just passed away, she had a heart attack. I'm not really close to her, last time I saw her Or talk to her was over a year ago. However, even tho my dad doesn't live with me, I care for him a lot, and I'm very sad because I know he is sad. I can't be with him physically right now but I want to send him a text or call him, however I have no idea what to say, I already had a small talk with him on the phone and just told him everything will be OK, but I guess that was not the best thing to say... so I'm looking for advice from you guys on what will be the best thing to say on this case
