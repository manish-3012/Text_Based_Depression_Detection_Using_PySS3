So my teacher just left me on read. I was asking her a question on teams in the chat about my senior project and she started typing and then stoped and she hasnâ€™t answered me since. Plus sheâ€™s on the board over a video call so I saw when she was typing and just stoped and started something to else.

American public school system for ya I guess
