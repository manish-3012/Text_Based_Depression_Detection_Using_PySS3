heres a bullshit conspiracy theory that i started. it became a religion for my karate class there is another universe watching us. trees are people and people are trees. everytime we cut down a tree a human dies. thats why people die so fucking much every day. the age of the tree determines the age of the human that dies. thats also why the queen of england is still fucking alive. her tree has not been cut down. we are indirect murderers of our own kind. we need to sue the people who clear out forests. they are murderers. they kill thousands, MILLIONS of people a year. all because they are cutting down our life trees. when people stop cutting down trees, humans live forever.
