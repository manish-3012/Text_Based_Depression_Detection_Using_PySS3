Im really anxious about my math teacher Last time we had class with him was wednesday and we started something new and with how the system in my country is organised (half the class goes to school and the other half goes online) I was in the online class. And he asked me a pretty basic question and i couldnt hit the unmute button and he thought i wasnt there ( i had my cam off ) and then i finally managed to unmute and i told him i was there but i just froze at the question and im so stressed that hes gonna remember me and ask me stuff on tuesday
