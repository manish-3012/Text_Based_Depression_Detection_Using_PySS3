I hate when people ship a guy and girl who are friends. LIKE PEOPLE CAN JUST BE FRIENDS. My guy friend and I get shipped all the fucking time, and itâ€™s super uncomfortable because weâ€™re like brother and sister to one another.

So please donâ€™t do that to every guy and girl you see thatâ€™s hanging out. Thank you very much. ðŸ˜Œ
