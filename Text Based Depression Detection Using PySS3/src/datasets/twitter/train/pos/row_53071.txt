Boys I failed but then I didnâ€™t, and I need your wisdom TL:DR at bottom

Okay so some backstory I do year round competitive swimming, and this year I got invited to the NCSA meet in Orlando (Big deal national meet) Since itâ€™s pretty hard to get into, only me and this one girl went to the 14-under meet. I have a strict rule that Iâ€™m not going to date until I can drive myself to the date, but there have been 3 people that have seriously made me reconsider that decision. She happened to be one of them.

Anyhow, throughout this 4 day long event we were just hanging out on the bleachers talking and laughing and stuff. She didnâ€™t mind my (lightly) offensive humor, I didnâ€™t mind her (lightly) patronizing humor. And the whole time Iâ€™m there trying to figure out a way to get her number. 

//side note: HER DAD IS THE COACH so itâ€™s not gonna be like a â€˜oh dumb kids trying to go outâ€™ itâ€™s gonna be more of a â€˜Iâ€™ll fucking kill you u/Sacrificial-Toenailâ€™

At one point the coach (her dad) took me out to [Unnamed tourist attraction] and dinner for team bonding or something And we went on some rides and stuff and yknow weâ€™re having fun, but both of her parents are there so I canâ€™t do anything (stay with me this story has an ending) so I just enjoy myself the rest of the night.

So on the last day weâ€™re talking and we get this idea to go though our camera rolls, so weâ€™re showing each other the best memes weâ€™ve found over the years (yes sheâ€™s a memer) and other dumb photos. She starts going through her Snapchat memories or something I donâ€™t have Snapchat, but she shows me this pic of her flipping the bird, and thatâ€™s the final nail in the coffin because sheâ€™s got her index finger half bent and her thumb out, if you know you know. 

By the way weâ€™re laughing and talking, so the other people around us can all hear if they wanted to. So this girl taps me on the shoulder and asks â€œExcuse me, but are you two dating?â€ And like a dumbass I respond with a â€œNo.â€ When I should have said yes and then followed up with a just kidding or something to gauge her response. So she sits back and says to someone else â€œthey should beâ€ and he agrees (she didnâ€™t hear this). Thatâ€™s when I realized that combined with everything else Iâ€™ve experienced this week, I need this girlâ€™s number, if not to get together just because sheâ€™s an awesome person. I promise myself that Iâ€™m not leaving this building until I get those digits.

I failed. 

But then I got a text from an unknown number that said â€œHey bro great job this weekâ€ obviously I wanted it to be her but I wasnâ€™t sure yet so I asked who it was. Sure enough it was. She had to contact a friend of mine to get my number! Obviously I should have asked her myself but still! If there are any girls reading this, is this a good thing? I feel like it is but Iâ€™m unsure.

TL:DR I failed to get a girls number but she contacted a friend of mine to text me. Good or bad news?
