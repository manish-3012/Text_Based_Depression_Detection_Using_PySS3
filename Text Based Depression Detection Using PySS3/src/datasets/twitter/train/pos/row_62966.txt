This is where online class got me So with this pandemic and all, we started online classes and stuff. We just finished class, and I had some homework to do and I was like, let me do it with one of my classmates but I didn't know with who.
I ended up asking a girl (yes a reddit bruh moment) and we actually had a really good time, we started talking more, playing games etc but when it comes to real life interaction we never really did anything cuz mr virus is on the loose. What I'm asking is if I should try and take it a step higher?
