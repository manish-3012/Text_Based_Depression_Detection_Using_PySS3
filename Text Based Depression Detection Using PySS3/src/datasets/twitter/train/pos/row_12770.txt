If you haven't already. y'all should check out Archive.org Parent here. I'm gonna sound like a dinosaur, but hear me out...

Back in my day (oh God), the internet was an amazing place filled with quirky little websites, videos, and a whole bunch of other cool junk. It wasn't as accessible, so the amount of grief and garbage was much lower. When all of this computer shit was new, there was a lot of cool stuff to check out.

If you want to spend some time checking some of this stuff out, instead of contributing to the mass advertising deluge that is YouTube and TikTok (not saying don't do them...I'm on them too), take a break and head over to [Archive.org](https://Archive.org). Some things you'll find on that site:

* [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/): look at any website at any point in time. Pretty amazing to see how websites have changed over the decades or find stuff that doesn't exist anymore.
* [MS-DOS Game Library](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games?tab=collection): play old games in a browser emulator. A lot of good stuff on there.
* [Audio Archive](https://archive.org/details/audio): great place to find audio samples for making that softboy lofi you kids are listening to.
* [TV Archive:](https://archive.org/details/tvarchive?&amp;sort=-downloads&amp;page=2) hundreds of thousands of video clips from TV stations and world events
* [OpenLibrary:](https://openlibrary.org/) so...many...books...available to check out for free. Wanna learn about something to compliment some of those YouTube videos? There's a ton of great information here.
* [Art from the Met:](https://archive.org/details/metropolitanmuseumofart-gallery) thousands of awesome images from their collection. I've definitely seen some meme material in there...also, just beautiful, interesting art.

Full disclosure, I'm a regular donator to the organization (I'm not employed by them, nor is this sponsored...I just love the site). They're a non-profit run by \~150 people and would probably love to see a bunch of folks check out what they've built.

Especially since everyone is going back to school, it's nice to have some other content to check out to break up your day. Who knows, maybe this stuff will actually help with your studies.

Anyway, that's it...hope y'all check it out and find cool shit on there.
