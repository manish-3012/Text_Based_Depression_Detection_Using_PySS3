Why I believe trump was the best thing to happen to the world [Serious] Hi there, it's the crazy guy who posts controversial shit and is not afraid to speak their mind.

Now moving onto something important.

Trump was a gift from God, heres why.

When you fracture a bone or a bone is broken in a weird way the doctors breaks the fractured bone or breaks the broken bone in a correct manner, though this is painful it helps heal the bone straight and correctly. 

Trump is something similar to that. He is breaking down society (through his idiocy) and exposing all the racism, sexism and stupidity society has to offer.

Now that we know the problems we should make an effort to solve these issues and rebuild society but this time do a better job, where it is not based on descrimination but rather based on collaborativit, merits and logic. 

Thank you for reading this
