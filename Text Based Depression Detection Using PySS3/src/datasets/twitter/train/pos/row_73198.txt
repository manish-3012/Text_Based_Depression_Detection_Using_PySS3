So apparently it's weird to talk out loud/talking by yourself when there's no one around My family thinks I'm weird asf for doing that.

Like wtf I'm being normal I'm just voicing out my internal thoughts inside my head bcs boi I think a lot like inside my head-It's loud so I feel the need to let it out and voice my thoughts out loud

I'm pretty sure lots of people do that.

Ok maybe sometimes I refer to myself in 3rd person and kinda talk to myself but most of the time I speak normally lol I'm not weird for it and I'm not crazy for talking out loud by myself.

No I'm not talking to someone else u cant see or a ghost??I'm not psychotic either pls I'm just voicing out my thoughtsss
