ranking the letters of the alphabet 1. S
to no ones surprise s is the most versatile letter out there. a nice shape, thousands of uses, no downsides, can go on almost every word, easy to make the sound.
2. Y
coming in at number two is y. a controversial pick to be sure, but itâ€™s unique status of being both a vowel and a consonant makes it unlike any other and truly unreplacable
3. A
the flagship mascot of the alphabet. best vowel. need i say more
4. L
incredibly fun to say, easy to write, simple, concise, clear.
5. B
i must admit iâ€™m a bit biased towards b because i used to have a speech impediment and b was really one of the only letters i could say clearly, but come on whatâ€™s not to like
6. I
i is not outstanding, but it is a vowel, and is one of two letters in the language that is its own word, and for that, i give it kudos 
7. T
t is one of the unsung heroâ€™s of the alphabet. it holds words together, starts them off, and is the partner of the best letter (t) a stellar letter without a doubt
8. H
h is the ultimate wingman. fits with half the letters in the alphabet, and makes them so much better.
9. C
c is just a spectacular sound. granted, it is not unique, but itâ€™s harsh tone makes words sound so fierce
10. E
 putting e any lower would just be disrespectful. it is the most overrated letter, but it absolutely carries half the alphabet.
11. P
p is a very polarizing letter. not quite as good as b but in combination with h becomes a whole different sound, which is fairly unique. not my favorite but still cool 
12. F
i canâ€™t put f much lower than p. f is just solid. soft, easy, and simple. not special but not bad
13. O
o is just the most average letter. itâ€™s a vowel sure, but it doesnâ€™t do anything special, isnâ€™t used in fun ways, and is just a circle.
14. X
i personally love x, but itâ€™s just not good enough on its own to be high ranked. it NEEDS help from vowels to really shine, and thatâ€™s just not the sign of a top tier letter
15. M
m is the most forgettable letter. often lost in speech and glossed over. not fun, not special, just forgetting. itâ€™s the arbyâ€™s of the alphabet 
16. N
literally just worse m. 
17. V
v is just... awkward. it doesnâ€™t fit anywhere really good and isnâ€™t particularly attractive. it has its uses but theyâ€™re really not that good. not fun to say, nor to write.
18. R
r is trying to be the jack of all trades, but canâ€™t do it properly. not harsh enough to be c, not smooth enough to be L, not versatile enough to be s.
19. U
without a doubt the worst vowel. practically made obsolete by o. i cannot stand u. makes gross noises in combo with others.
20. Z
i want to put z higher. i really do. but itâ€™s too annoying to say, too similar to s, and just too niche.
21. G
g has the WORST noise in the alphabet. if not for its sheer amount of uses it would be last.
22. J
j is underused and for a reason. itâ€™s not useful. it doesnâ€™t have any combos, and canâ€™t even end a good word. needs to get its stuff together
23. K
wannabe c. pointless letter.
24. Q
q is useless without u. itâ€™s literally ANOTHER C SOUND. and is SO underused. grated the q and u combo sounds cool, which is the only thing preventing it from being even lower
25. W
ugly letter, unoriginal name. terrible sound. would be the worse if not for the last on our list 
26. D
d is a terrible letter. used too much for its value. way too hard to say in the middle of a word. can be easily misheard. not fun to write. i hate it.
