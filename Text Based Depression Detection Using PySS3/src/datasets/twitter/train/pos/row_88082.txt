I just wanted to share this story somewhere, so I decided to share it here. The story of how I broke through my school ceiling (long warning) I Was In 7th Grade &amp; for my school thats the year that's the year were you stop taking music classes (School max grade was 8th, very small school Maybe 300 Kids) But I &amp; Some of my friends didn't like that, because around that time I Was learning Piano (Now I'm a Pianist Good Job Past Me) &amp; I Was in pretty good relationship with The Music teacher their who was very friendly, but the thing is, when the grade below us was learning music (The music room was right next to the gym) the 7th &amp; 8th graders would do gym &amp; that stuff, are schedule was we do workouts for about half an hour &amp; goof off &amp; play like dodge-ball or something like that &amp; than when we were done the music teacher is done &amp; would lock up the music room because that's all it would been used for the day. But The Thing me &amp; my friends did after we did our work outs since we weren't really athletic kids (healthy and all but just sports weren't are thing) we would ask the music teacher that if we would have the keys for the music room &amp; it would just be us in there either playing Piano, talking about Music or listening To Music or just doing whatever, we would make sure it was fine with the coach &amp; if they both said yes than the music room was ours &amp; than when we were done we would lock the room up, give the keys to the coach, &amp; then in the next day, the coach would give the keys to the music teacher. It all worked out good, But one day, The Music Teacher was sick, &amp; their was no music even for the 6th graders (I'm pretty sure they just went back into their rooms) but anyway when we were done with our exercises we were kinda screwed. We politely asked the coach for the keys, but he said "No, Because the music teacher wouldn't know that you were there" Fair Enough, But The Thing was, grade 5th-9th you're in idiot, &amp; we couldn't take "No" For 'an answer, so what we did me &amp; my 3 friends sneakily snuck around the gym &amp; got in the hallway were the music room door was, &amp; above the door was those type of Styrofoam pallets of squares that you could easily tip over to the side of the roof &amp; go above the school roof, but the thing was. It was to high, But the thing was, there was a ice cooler right next to the door that, If one of us stood on it we could tip the Styrofoam pallets sneak through the roof, go tip the Styrofoam pallets through the music room above, Jump down &amp; unlock the door from the inside. Now, I Was the one who came up for this idea, &amp; we all kind of joked around about It, but we never thought we actually could do it, until after like 10 minutes of us getting bored we couldn't take it (i know, 10 minutes of excruciating pain) I Said "Ima Do It" my friends thought i was insane (witch i kind of was) but i actually convinced them that i was gonna do it, So i started to do it. My heart filled with adrenaline as i was doing it for ear of being caught, so my friends kept a look-out of if anybody was coming, so I pushed it above me, put it to the side, got my hands in front of the railing that the wall in-front of me was holding pushed myself up, &amp; I Was their, sitting on the top of the wall, with my friends in a stupid amaze like "Wow I can't believe you did that, You're an Idiot" Type look, anyway i gave them a thumbs up, got my fingers through the Styrofoam pallets lifted it up carefully and put it to the side &amp; jumped down. I Was In! I immediately unlocked the door from the inside, turned on the lights &amp; my friends were shocked (&amp; so was I) we kinda quietly did a little girl squeal and said our "Oh My Gods" &amp; "Holy Crap",s, than one of the friends went on the the other side, pulled the Styrofoam pallets back in place, &amp; I did the exact same on the other side. We were scot free, did are usual stuff, locked the doors back &amp; turned of the lights &amp; no one expected a thing (surprisingly cause we were gone for a really long time) the next day we kept talking about it &amp; we were so proud of ourselves, but the next day, The Music Teacher was still sick (probably flu) &amp; when we went to the gym, we decided to do it again. so after are workouts, we decided to sneak off in the back &amp; go back in the hallway were the music room was &amp; go back in there again. So i got up on the freezer-thing pushed myself up, but i forgot to rest on the top of the wall, &amp; Sat down on the back styrofoam pallet, &amp; i immediately plopped down to the floor, very noticable (surprised the faculty didn't hear it) But my friends sure did, i IMMEDIATELY unlocked the door &amp; showed them the monstrosity i made. We were all scared out of our minds, Thinking were dead. We tried to fix up the mess but it just was too noticeable, a whole 4 palets came out with a big chunk in the roof. We immediately went to the coach &amp; lied saying "tHe rOOf jUSt cAmE dOWn &amp; prObaBLY bOke OR SomEtHiNG, I duNnO" he somehow bought it &amp; got really frustrated &amp; told the superintendent &amp; The Princable, who came down to examine the place, &amp; we thought we were scot free because everybody seemed to believe our story. But the thing was, one of our friends always stays after school to our care centar called "Aftercare" for parents who don't get off at a time were it possible to pick their kids up at 3:00PM, the cafetiera. &amp; when he was at Aftercare one of the coaches (we had 2) came up to him &amp; said "are you sure you &amp; your friends had nothing to do with this", now, little info on my friend, he is very prone to intimidation (both of our coaches were intimidating people) &amp; when we he said that, he came clean. The next day when i came to school my that friend came to me &amp; said, "I Told Him" I Immediately knew what he ment, the other friend knew &amp; we all gave each other the "Were Screwed" Look, When I Told Him "Why" He said, "The Coach said there was cameras in there, i couldn't lie to him) There was no Cameras in there before we did what we did, &amp; now there is cameras in that room (smart choice) wew had a innercome just to our room so only we could hear it (7th grade) when we were all seated &amp; the principal said, We Need "Me, Friend #1, &amp; Friend #2" after the morning announcements are done, Out teacher said "okay, I'll be sure to bring them down there" &amp; while the class not even teacher knowing what was going on, everybody saw our group gave each other the "Oh.... Crap" Look, when the announcements were done we got our bags, &amp; went down to the office, &amp; when we got in her room, there was, the superintendent, the princable, the two coaches, the 8th grade teacher, &amp; then she called in the 7th grade teacher, (the two classes had to wait outside of the office, probably gossiping about us, we were incredibly embarrassed) &amp; then we sat down in our seats &amp; we all came clean. After we left the room, the elders had a discussion &amp; came in, after a actuall heartfelt note i sent to the superintendent (known the dude for years very nice guy) i think that was the thing that sat 'em of to say "Don't Punish Them To Bad", at my school, we were generally known as "Good Kids" &amp; it kinda made them all sad to see one of there "Best' Student go down this rabbit-hole, we all got ISD for 3 days, &amp; THAT'S IT! Dude I'm Still Shocked to this day, that is all the punishment i got (well, not excluding a 2 week grounding from my parents) &amp; other than that, we were just the talk of the school until summer break! And no one really talks about what we did any more at that school.
