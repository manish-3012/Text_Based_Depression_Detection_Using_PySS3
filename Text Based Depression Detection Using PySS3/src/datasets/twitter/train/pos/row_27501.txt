Guys i just realised that the media is more powerful than the most powerful person on earth If you guys dont believe me ,imagine you are the best person in the entire world but the media says your a terrible person , now imagine if you were a president doing a good job and the media tells people that the job youre doing is terrible . The media also had the abillity to make us forget , example , in the phillipines  a cop murdered a mother and her child and the media barely covered it ( they did but like you know not as much ) now a women died of supposed rape ( she wasnt raped but thats what the news said ) and they went ape shit on that , (not saying thats bad but hey ) , all im saying is the media covered it up basically .



Im not sure about the facts here , but still an example
