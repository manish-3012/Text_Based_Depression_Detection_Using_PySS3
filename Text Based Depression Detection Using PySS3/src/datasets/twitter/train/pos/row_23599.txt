Oh yeah Not to brag I've got a girlfriend
Yeah she's my valentine
She's like the hottest girl
She's so pretty, she's all mine
People ask if what we have is real
She's so cool, she's got a pool
She just goes to a different school

She's a model, you don't know her
She lives in Canada where it's colder
I'm in love and you're not
My real girlfriend's really hot

DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN

ONE THE VERY FIRST DAY OF CAMP
I HELD HER HAND AND WE MADE OUT
SHE'S EVEN HOTTER THAN HER TWIN SISTER
I'D SHOW A PICTURE BUT SHE HATES PICTURES

yes I am very bored.
