How do i take initiative? Recently, iâ€™ve been getting to know a girl in my class who apparently has a crush on me. I have a crush on her too, and we are really getting along well. 
However, we have gotten to a point where i feel like one of us has to take initiative for us to be a thing, and i want to be the one to do so. The problem is: i donâ€™t know how. 
Does anyone know what i should do in this situation?
Also, i apologize for my poor wording.
