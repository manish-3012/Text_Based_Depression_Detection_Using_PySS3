small confession i gotta make since hopefully not a lot of ppl will notice now i truly didn't know until just tonight hp lovecraft was an author and not some weird fanfic genre of Harry Potter. i just assumed Harry Potter fans were on another level when it came to fanfic. i just saw a random comment on a spongebob meme relating it to lovecraft and got the courage to google it and it wasn't what i expected (which is probably good in this case)
