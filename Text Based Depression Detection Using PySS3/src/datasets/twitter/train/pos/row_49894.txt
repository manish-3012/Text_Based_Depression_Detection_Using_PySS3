so I was thinkin'... since my stepdad is around 40-45 years old and doesn't smoke, we can assume he'll probably live past 60

so, *hypothetically,* if I kill myself before I reach the age of 30 and he lives past 60, then he would outlive me.

and since he's the oldest in the household, *hypothetically,* that would make me the first person in this household to die instead of him, the obvious First-to-Die candidate

&amp;#x200B;

well that's crazy :l
