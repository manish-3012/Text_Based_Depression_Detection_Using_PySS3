I just dreamed my crush told me I was fucking ugly In the dream she was talking to her friend about me and my other friend.

My friend and I was overhearing the conversation.

Her friend asked if she liked me or my other friend, and she told her she see us as her friends.

Then her friend asked about how good we look in her opinion and she said that she thought I was ugly and kinda giggled a bit. He said my friend was alright.

I cant fucking dream wholesome dreams and instead get friendzoned and told I was ugly IN A FUCKING DREAM!
