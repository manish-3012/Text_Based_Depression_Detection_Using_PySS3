How did you guys get a girlfriend? Listen here Iâ€™m trying not to sound like a simp here, but I want to be ready for a relationship. Iâ€™m a really nice person and all of my friends know that but for some unexplained reason only my friends can get girlfriend but I canâ€™t. One of my friends literally took a selfie with 5 different girls in one picture and it blew my mind when I saw the picture that these girls would date my friends but Iâ€™m the only one who canâ€™t get one. What should I do to increase my chances of getting a girlfriend? Just to note I believe in being friends first before dating.
