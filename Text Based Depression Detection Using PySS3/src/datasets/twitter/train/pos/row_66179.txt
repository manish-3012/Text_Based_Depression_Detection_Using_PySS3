Because I got hit by most of these recently, 25 general things in life I dislike. 1. Acne.
2. Being comfy on a chair/couch/bed, and having to get up to use the washroom.
3. An extremely small stain on a white shirt.
4. Parent(s) who don't apologize, just start acting nicer.
5. Accidentally smudging glasses.
6. Not sleeping.
7. Seeing teenagers you know (or just in general) in public, despite being one yourself.
8. Grinding for hours in a game, and losing all the progress within a 10-minute losing streak.
9. Not doing something fun for a long time, then when you finally get the privilege to do so, you screw something up.
10. Clogged nose.
11. Slowly seeing your eyesight worsen despite taking all precautions to protect those vision melons.
12. Not having anything new to watch.
13. Hearing your own recorded voice.
14. Family member hogging something the entire day.
15. Eating out of boredom, guilt, or sadness.
16. The brain always being self-deprecating.
17. Trying to mimic a singer, and sounding like a nasal donkey.
18. Being told to do something for a certain amount of time, or else there is no "feeling".
19. Spotify ads talking about Skip the dishes and how Spotify ads are annoying. When I'm listening to sleep sounds at 11 pm.
20. Seeing friends achieve stuff that "is stuff you should accomplish at *x* age.
21. Not seeing improvement despite days of dedication, focus, and hard work.
22. Biking and stopping to cross a road, and while cars are waiting, having to regain that momentum which takes a \*precious\* extra 5 seconds.
23. Karen stories that pop up daily.
24. Reading, and losing the will to read after being constantly pushed about it.
25. Stubbing a pencil.
