Ignore this. Its just a small rant. Im kinda angry right now since i joined a server on Among Us and since the game wasn't starting i decided to write "start" in the chat. A person named death note decided to say something like "shut up lime" (i was lime in that game) and was being a bit rude for literally no reason? I wasn't trying to be rude by writing start while they were talking to their other buddies in the chat, so i wrote "oh sorry". 
The game starts, someone reports the body, and death note and his friends start saying it was me with no fucking proof. I got voted off and lost my fucking temper, im very short-tempered and im working on fixing that but i got angry so i started cussing at the person, their friend jumped in to defend them. 
After the round ended, i rejoined that server and then they banned me. 
I mean fair enough, it wasn't nice of me to go off like that and im sorry to the person for loosing my temper, but are we gonna just ignore the fact they were being rude for no reason towards me?
