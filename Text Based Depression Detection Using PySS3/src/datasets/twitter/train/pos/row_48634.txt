Parents, I don't care that my friends aren't "always on their handphones" I don't care, I'm not them

You don't parent the same way as them, I sure as hell didn't grow up in the same environment as them, not heard the same stories.

So why the HELL ARE YOU COMPARING ME TO THEM. I GET IT, YOU LOVE ME, I LOVE YOU TOO PARENTS BUT COULD YOU STOP BLOODY COMPARING ME TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY FRIENDS THAT YOU MEET? I understand that you're trying to make me a better person, BUT COMPARING ME TO MY FRIENDS, SAYING "WhAt aBouT &lt;insert name&gt;, iS hE AlwAYs On HIs hANdpHOnE?" DOES NOT HELP ME, IT JUST MAKES ME MAD. SO STOP TELLING ME THAT THE PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME HAPPY AND THAT IT'S FAILING TO DO IT'S JOB. IT'S NOT, WHAT MAKES ME MAD ISN'T THE BLOODY PHONE, IT'S WHEN YOU 

#**COMPARE ME TO MY FRIENDS**

I'M NOT THEM, I DON'T WANT TO **BE** LIKE THEM.

I LOVE YOU, BUT IT'S GETTING PRETTY DAMN IRRITATING WHEN YOU COMPARE ME TO OTHER PEOPLE. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PARENT ME, BUT BLOODY HELL!

Stop, stop comparing me to my friends, it hurts. You don't even know what they do at home, they could be the exact same as me, but you wouldn't know.
