A short sad true story of me being a dumbass So the cute girl on the bus asked for my snap today, so I wrote it down for her, but I accidentally wrote down my reddit username and not my snapchat username. (They're almost\* identical) She gave me her phone and told me to write it in her notes (because her internet wasn't working). Now a homie has to wait till Monday.
