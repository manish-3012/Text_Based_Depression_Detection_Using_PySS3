Qustodio survived a factory reset!!! I had a shitty app called Qustodio installed on my phone.
I factory reset, after about two days my mom was still able to see everything I did through the app!
HOW? Its not installed anymore, I dont get blocked from things anymore but it seems that the ghost of the app is still there.
Please help.
