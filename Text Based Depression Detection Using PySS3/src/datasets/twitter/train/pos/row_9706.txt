I literally shake so hard when I text my favorite person Whenever I text my best friend (who I might have a small crush on, undecided on that) or hear their voice or see them I start like. vibrating. Like it starts from my core and I just get so happy and ah!! I just wanted to share to see if anyone goes through the same thing!!
