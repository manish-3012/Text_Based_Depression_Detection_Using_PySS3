So howâ€™s it feel being separated from your old classmates? Itâ€™s already almost the end of the year. I love my class. Thereâ€™s a few bad apples but overall the class is great despite its few issues. I feel like the time Iâ€™ve spent with them was short. Iâ€™ve been an antisocial person since the first day of secondary(or middle for americans) school. I feel like Iâ€™ve only changed a bit. I feel like Iâ€™m at ease because I got to know my classmates a bit.

Now all of itâ€™s being thrown out the window. The system forces us to be in different classes because not every class will have the same subjects. I donâ€™t know what class my friends will be going to. Itâ€™s all based on the subjects they choose. Next year Iâ€™m might have to be in a class of complete strangers. Iâ€™ll see a few familiar faces. I feel like Iâ€™m gonna be an antisocial mess again. Time is passing so fast. In the blink of an eye Iâ€™d already be turning 15. In a few more blinks I might even be in college. My life feels wasted.

Iâ€™m gonna miss most of my classmates even if I didnâ€™t get to know them very well. My class isnâ€™t very bonded. There have been many attempts to bring us closer but they all failed. Despite that, I will still miss them. I want to make sure we all keep in touch. Hell, I donâ€™t even know what subjects to choose. All these crazy things happening so fast make me feel a bit depressed. Itâ€™s a horrible feeling. I hope I can deal with this when the day finally comes where we all go our separate ways. I hope we can all stay together.
