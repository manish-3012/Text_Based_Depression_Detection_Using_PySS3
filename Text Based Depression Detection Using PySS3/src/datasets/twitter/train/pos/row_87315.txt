I downloaded tiktok Yep, you read the title right, I downloaded tiktok. Please read this before downvoting me to hell.

Now from what I understand Iâ€™m now supposed to have committed the greatest sin on Reddit. After seeing all those memes about tiktok being bad and cringe I had to see it for myself, after all you canâ€™t take what everyone says as fact, one must make his own observations. After some time on tiktok I have come to a conclusion, itâ€™s not actually that bad, it is really funny.

Will you still accept me fellow redditors?
