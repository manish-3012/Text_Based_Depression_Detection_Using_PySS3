my mom just forgot how old I was she was giving me a hug and was like â€œi canâ€™t believe youâ€™re still only 12 you seem so bigâ€ or whatever, but Iâ€™m 13. not a big difference or anything and she probably just said the wrong number so I corrected her, and then she just gave me this blank stare, and then she started laughing while covering her face because apparently she actually thought I was still 12 when Iâ€™ve been 13 since july.
