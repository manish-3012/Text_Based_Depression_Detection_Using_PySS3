I legit hate online games They're so stupid it's like just whoever clicks on the other person the fastest wins, and it's stressful and you have to waste so much time just to get good enough to the point where you can last 5 seconds. And you can't just pause and stop playing wherever you want. 

My anxiety says hell no even Doom can get stressful a lot of the time I'd rather play older single player games.
