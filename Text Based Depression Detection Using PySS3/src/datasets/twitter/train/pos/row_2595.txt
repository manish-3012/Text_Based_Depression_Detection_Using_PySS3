Sometimes I just feel invisible... Like nobody can see me

Say hello and I get no response

No one asks me how Iâ€™m feeling

I donâ€™t know if I just blend in or if they are ignoring me

Lifeâ€™s not fair

I blend into the crowd

I could try to scream but it donâ€™t matter how loud

No matter what I do, they just look right through me.

Just cause Iâ€™m wearing all camo doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not a human being.

I donâ€™t know if I just blend in or if theyâ€™re ignoring me 

Just cause I look like a tree donâ€™t mean you gotta be a jerk 

I think it looks kinda cool I donâ€™t really see the issue with wearing all camo

And Iâ€™m also in a bush
