My science teacher just confirmed everything this sub believes in We were having class about covalent bonds between elements and he was trying to describe how non polar covalent bonding works. So he goes â€œimagine if youâ€™re at a club and Ryan Reynolds bursts in the door like itâ€™s in some old 80s movie. Whatâ€™s your girlfriend going to do?â€ And some kid says â€œRyan Reynolds is the Deadpool guy right?â€ And the teacher says â€œyeah, but Ryan Reynolds is generally considered attractive. So your girl is going to leave you. Your gonna be a virgin till college yada yada yada. Same with electrons. Some positive element comes In and they are out of there. And you will never get anymore electrons.â€

I felt this lecture on a spiritual level.
