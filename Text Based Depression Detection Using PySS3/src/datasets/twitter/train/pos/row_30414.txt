Why is my teacher like this It's Friday. Imagine you have to do some homework for the next week. You think to yourself "ah, I'll do it after relaxing today or something"

Then you open to see what you have to do exactly and see "sike you had to send your homework like 45 minutes ago"

So basically this dude gave us homework today and some people probably have to speedrun it because everyone takes the bus to school.

So yeah I'm like 1h late now. Why
