I think Lofi should be a genre more people listen to Lofi is the perfect blend of musicality and chill that can is more appropriate for our generation. 

What kind of music teenagers like are varied: rock, rap, alt, etc. What we like reflects upon our character, our nature, our upbringings. Lofi is a perfect medium for when someone wants to chill and reflect upon their time as a teenager. While lofi won't be able to deliver a fast tempo for highly driven moments, it's the intimate, lone time that lofi exceeds at; Furthermore, it exceeds at being versatile and diverse for a teenager's ups and down.

Consequently from headlines, sound bites, and flashes of fame, time can be seen as flying by and teenagers are wasting their time. Hip hop and pop certainly help the problem when a popular topic is fame and money. It can cause anxiety. On the other hand, lofi is a journey that can clear a cacophony of clashing cans in your day to day life. Smell the roses. As long as the sun comes up and the stars are down, there's growth ready to happen, even at micro steps 

Life is a personalized game, everyone has a different pacing, and it's not about speed running. Lofi perfectly shapes this mood and reinforces it into the listener. Thank you new people for reading this.
