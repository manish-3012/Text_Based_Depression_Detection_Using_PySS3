Why in the world would you make a school book where you don't give translations to words that are supposed to be learned . So i just checked my German school book and I have to study words for a test , and I open on the page I'm supposed to get these words from ,and immediately I am confused . The people that wrote this thing expect me to find the accurate translations of the words and then study them . What the actual fuck why wouldn't you write the translation of the words , what if I don't have access to internet and I am using a dictionary that doesn't have the translations to these words , this is some degenerate system . Instead of it taking 2 hours to learn this it will take 3 , just because I have to check the accurate translation . Is this normal , and if so why and who approved it , it is so blatantly flawed I can't even believe such a thing could be so badly done
