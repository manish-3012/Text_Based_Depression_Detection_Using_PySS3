People who don't/didn't have their own room growing up, how has this affected you? I'm sure most of us (if not all) have heard that everyone needs their own space, especially teenagers. How does not having this space affect a person?

Does it change you for the worse or for the better? How does it create rifts in your family? I have several questions and I'm hoping some of y'all can answer them. Let's talk.
