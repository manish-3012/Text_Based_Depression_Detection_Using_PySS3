I think almost everyone has some kind of home movie where when you're a little kid you nearly fall off of something possibly a horse or a small building and your dad miraculously makes a good catch keeping you from falling off said object or animal It's like dad reflexes.... My mother literally has a video of every one of me or my siblings falling off of some object as a little kid and dad catching us randomly at least for me I was maybe a year old and walking and I nearly tumbled down 3 flights of stairs dad caught me on the landing before I went headlong down a flight of stairs and that's why there were a baby gates everywhere when we were growing up until my youngest brother  Old enough where they weren't necessary anymore.

Theres also videos of as moving from base to base when dad was reassigned where there's just literally boxes labeled baby gates like 3 of them that my parents would take with us everywhere..

I can kind of understand why mom always wanted a house with one story instead of 2 or 3 in most cases.... But that's kind of hard to find In some European countries
