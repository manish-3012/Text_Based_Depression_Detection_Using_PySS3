Theres everything wrong with me Everyone hates me and I understand them I hate me too but I wish I could be normal I'm not someone people want to be friends with and no one talks to me in school. I'm always suicidal and can't do anything I don't know what to do anymore I can't even talk to people. Not even online. If someone messages me I freak out and delete all my social media as if it would help. And I just lost my only friend I saw it coming but I wasnt prepared I just want to end this I really want to
