Like, you wanna go or not? Boys (and other humans) we should retake Jerusalem. I mean it would fun group activity. Like we could order some swords, chain mail, helmet, and maybe some group cloaks. I mean, Deus Vult. Should we like carpool? Or should we travel separately. Or, we could even do a mixture of both. Should we go all out, and buy passage on a ship? And if we do, should we go Templar, or Tuetonic knights? Those are two most common, but we could make do. Ask your moms cause mine would probably say no if I ask.
