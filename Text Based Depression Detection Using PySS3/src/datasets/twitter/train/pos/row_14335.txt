Some are very kind to give me hope that my dog will live
Sadly... he is now in the heavens of good pets where god can give him the love, the same love as ours which he once lost, now forever 
This was told by my father to my mom which she had a mental breakdown and I too as well in the middle of the class then it gave me a migraine forcing me to skip a few zoom calls. 
I almost broke my chair into pieces with my kendo sword before I tole myself â€œWhat can breaking a chair help you ?â€
It was heartbreaking that I will never going to meet my dog, my beagle again. Now I can only physically hold him with love in a cremation jar.

It was painful to even accept the fact that my pet is gone in a instant, he never get to see his original family again, but his spirit of being a good boi, the bestest boi here with us. 
Really a dejected moment for me and my family, now I wish the same fate wont happen to his sister which she is coming here with us so that we can do better for her
