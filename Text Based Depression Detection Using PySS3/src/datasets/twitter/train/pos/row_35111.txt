I want to ask my crush out but I donâ€™t know how, could you guys pls give me some suggestions/help? Iâ€™ve liked her for 9 months now and recently weâ€™ve  been talking a lot more and FaceTiming like every night. All of my friends thing that she likes me back but I donâ€™t think she does and Iâ€™m scared that if I end up asking her out and she says no it will destroy our whole friendship. What should I do?
