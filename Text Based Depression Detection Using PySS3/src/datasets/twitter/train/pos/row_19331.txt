I want to lose 20 lbs and I told my mom and she said Iâ€™m gonna â€œbe a skeletonâ€ I guess guys would consider me â€œthiccâ€ rn but I feel fat and wanna lose weight and my mom said I shouldnâ€™t cuz Iâ€™m gonna be a stick :) I literally canâ€™t win. I hate my body so much and just want to be happy but if she gonna bodyshame me once I lose weight idk what to do
