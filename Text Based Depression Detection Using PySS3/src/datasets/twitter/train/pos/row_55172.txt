im coming out of the closet! oh wow i forgot what sunlight looked like!

anyway umm iâ€™m coming out as pansexual to my family, that shouldnâ€™t be too difficult, but i also need to figure out how to explain to my parents that my future significant other isnâ€™t a girl or a boy... and idk how to do that. my dad thinks that you become a boy so that girls will like you more rather than if you were still a girl... or visa versa. so explaining gender neutral wonâ€™t be very easy.. does anyone have any tips?? 

all you transphobic and homophobic things better shut your mouths and go back to your â€˜biden stupid memesâ€™
