Hard work doesnâ€™t always pays off Today I realised â€œhard work pays offâ€ is utter bullshit.
I studied for an exam for 2 years, worked my ass off, sacrificed a whole lot of things. I did everything I could, I used to score excellent marks in the mock tests but in the end Iâ€™ve got an average score. 
Itâ€™s really difficult to accept the result.
