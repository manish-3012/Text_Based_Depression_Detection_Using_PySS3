Does anyone else take their shoes half off and on repeatedly when they're bored / nervous? My brother recently called me out on this. I never realised it but it's something I do in school constantly (Private school with uncomfortable formal shoes)

Does anyone else have this weird tick or know why they do it? Or remember when you started?
