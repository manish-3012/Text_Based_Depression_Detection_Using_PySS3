Hereâ€™s a poem I wrote Sugar Birdâ€™s Broken Record
By SpagEddie8113 

In a sea made of grape soda,
Thereâ€™s a dolphin named Miss June,
She jumped out of the ocean,
And flew over the moon.

While flying she found a seagull,
With sugar coated wings,
Chirping â€œHelp me Miss June, Please!
I canâ€™t fix this strange thing!â€

And he held to June a record,
That had been broken in 2,
So June just stood their thinking,
 She didnâ€™t know what to do.

â€œWell come into the sea with me, 
Thatâ€™s where I do my thinking.â€
So the sugary bird followed her,
And they kept on sinking.

â€œWe could maybe use some squid ink, 
To act as makeshift glue,
Seaweed to tie the broken pieces,
Is always an option too.â€

The sugar bird thought about it, 
And said back to Miss June
â€œI like the squid ink option, 
Could you find a squid near soon?â€

And Miss June simply laughed, 
â€œWell of course I can, dear bird, 
I have a pet squid over that way, 
To get ink just say the word.â€

So the bird looked to the squid, 
And said â€œSquid! â€˜The wordâ€™, ink!â€ 
And the squid looked right back at him,
And did a little wink.

The squid did a little shake,
And knew now was his time,
He exploded into a puff of black, 
A cloud of ink divine

â€œThank your dearest June!
And thank you lilâ€™ Squid too! 
Now I have the ink to fix this record, 
Just like new!â€

To celebrate the moment,
They played the record then, 
It was a beautiful arrangement, 
And a happy storyâ€™s end.

I wrote it for my girlfriend because she doesnâ€™t like my fancy symbol-y poems that are about like me and such. I think it was fun
