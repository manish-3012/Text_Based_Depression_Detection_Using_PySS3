Anyone else REALLY hate school? Like, I am willing to sacrifice a lot if that meant no school. If someone offered me a deal in which I never saw any of my friends in person again, but I had no school, I'd probably take it. I know it's kinda stereotypical for a teenage boy to despise school but I fucking ***HATE*** school.
