So long friends So my exams are 2 weeks away and i must pass these. Reddit was very addicting for me i was even scrolling through Reddit in the online class. So i think you can tell where this is going i am uninstalling reddit to focus more on my lessons i will probably install it again in 2 months or maybe i wont i am not sure. But Reddit was pretty fun for me and who knows maybe i will lose my virginity one day. But for know goodbye everyone
