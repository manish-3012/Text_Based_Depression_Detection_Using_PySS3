Complications with college and what I want to do with my life. Hey I hope you teenagers are having a good day.
I was hoping you could help me with something im having trouble working out in my head.

Basically I have recently started going to college but for the last three weeks I have had to have time off now and again because I have been quite ill. During this time I have been thinking of quiting college and having the rest of the year off then coming back next year to restart college, get to all my classes and feel motivated. 
I have always wanted a year off and because of that I havent been very motivated to go to college and so I think if I did take a year off it may make my grades better.
So what do you think? Do you think I should go back to college and carry on or do you think I should have a year off (the year off has to be approved so it could take a few weeks to be able to start my year off)
Anyway hope you people have a good rest of your day!
