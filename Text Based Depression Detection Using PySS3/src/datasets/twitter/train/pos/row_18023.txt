Bye for Now. My parents are forcing me to download Life 360 so they can keep controlling me and my dad threatened to beat me with a belt and threatened to supply me with only basic necessities and wants me to move out. Iâ€™m 15. This isnâ€™t the first time this has happened. My sister has depression and tried to kill herself. I have frequent mental breakdowns. My parents are taking my phone so I wont see you all for some time. It was fun.
