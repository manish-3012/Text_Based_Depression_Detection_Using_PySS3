I keep seeing all those posts about people liking someone and not knowing what to do... I WISH THERE WAS SUCH A PERSON FOR ME TOO. Because I don't like anyone. I don't have a crush to like, think about, or try to get closer to. All those people having a crush and just being too shy/stupid to get them should be HAPPY. Yes, happy. Also they should just ask them out.
