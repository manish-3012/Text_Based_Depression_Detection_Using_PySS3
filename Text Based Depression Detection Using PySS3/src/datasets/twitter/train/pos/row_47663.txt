Can I tell yâ€™all a story that makes me laugh? Some might not find it funny, as first I didnâ€™t either, but thinking back I laugh so hard at it.

So I dated this dude off and on for a small bit. (LDR) One night, we were just having a random conversation and I mentioned my older sibling and started talking about them. Skip ahead a few minutes and I get a text back from the dude Iâ€™m dating with MY FULL FUCKING ADDRESS LIKE â€œthis you?â€ So I got angry and we got into an argument about how it was a breach of my privacy and he was mad because I wouldnâ€™t tell him where I lived and I got mad because I told him I wasnâ€™t comfortable with that and would tell him in time, but noooo he didnâ€™t wanna wait.

Skip ahead like two years. We had broken up and hadnâ€™t talked for those years. I get a text from him like â€œwhatâ€™s good? Took me forever to find you. Itâ€™s 4am and Iâ€™m in the mood to make a mistake.â€ So I responded, we got to talking again, and I went fucking off on this guy hardcore. The relationship was extremely abusive and left me with so many issues, along with a bunch of anger. So when I say I went off, I mean I went O F F. Every single thing that had upset me, everything that I had wanted to say and every single feeling I had was thrown at this dude. Everything I had held inside for those two years came out in a matter of hours, and he took the full brunt of it. He agreed. He listened. He let me rant (which I really needed). Then he apologized, for everything, he explained that I was right to have those feelings and how he was a toxic asshole and everything else of the sort. 

To finish off a story that really shouldnâ€™t be this long and has way too much over sharing, we started sending each other memes and the convo ended with us fucking losing our minds over microwaves and â€œmmmmMMMMMMMâ€ and he showed me his cats and it was nice. It was the closure I needed, and it seems it was what he needed to. 

Damn I miss his dumbass lmao
