I got kicked out of online class because a kid was insulting me I was in the class and I did a reaction emoji by accident, this guy in my class replied ''you're a sad don'' I'm from England and that just means, you're a sad guy, I replied with the obvious reply, ''who asked'', he proceeded to call me a ''prick'' a ''tramp'', ''clapped'' and all I replied with was ''never :)'' when he told me to shut up. And then the teacher kicked me, I went back into the class and he was still in there and I was kicked immediately. This teacher is very biased, in her class, the guy who was insulting me plays on his phone all lesson and listens to music and doesn't get in trouble, while if I take a second to let my hands rest from drawing (art class btw) I get shouted at. Makes no sense tbh thought I'd see what you guys think.
