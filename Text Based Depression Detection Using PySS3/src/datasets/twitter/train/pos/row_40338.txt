Starting Freshman Year after I was bullied last year, Iâ€™m nervous. Last year and the year before that in the 7th-8th grade I was bullied about my appearance, I look very different from the other students, or you could say for short (Exotic) the school the i go to is somewhat predominantly Caucasian and Hispanic, Iâ€™m super mixed with a whole bunch of shit and Iâ€™m 2nd Gen American which makes me closer to my foreigner roots. Everyday that I went to school they would ALWAYS talk about my nose and say that I had a witch nose and point and stare at it during lunch, it was so embarrassing. I would usually sit by myself at lunch too since nobody liked me, or they thought I was â€œtoo weirdâ€ and I always ate school lunch since my moms home cooked traditional meals embarrassed me and â€œsmelt nastyâ€ to the other kids. The bullying got so bad that I tried to take my life before my 14th birthday, I just thought that I couldnâ€™t take it another year, I also go bullied heavily online as well, the name calling and threats wouldnâ€™t stop at all, and I think one of the students posted my nose on the internet and made fun of me. I need advice before I return to school in 2 days. Iâ€™m too embarrassed and stressed out I canâ€™t handle being bullied again.
