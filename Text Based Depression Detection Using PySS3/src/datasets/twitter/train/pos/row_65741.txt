Now this is one of the post that says please dont downvote me and not i know this is going to be downvoted I use reddit, and is a boy, but sometimes I feel like we are forced to do things we don't want on here, like why do I have to like clone wars?  I would rather watch descendants... :D and sometimes I feel like I have to push my intrests to what reddit expects and I don't like that... why don't qe just let people do what they want.... :)

Ps. I'm christian and no one likes christians on reddit

Pps. I know a lot of you will try to convince me to watch clone wars yea I have watched it  I don't like it like why do they just tell you what is going to happen in the beginning why is the storyline so complicated idk...

Ppps. B4 you comment hate pls remember that you accept other stuff like megamind and Lgbtq so like accept me too not sayin that megamind or lgbtq is bad just accept everything y'know? As long as it is legal....;)


Pppps. Just one more ps lol
