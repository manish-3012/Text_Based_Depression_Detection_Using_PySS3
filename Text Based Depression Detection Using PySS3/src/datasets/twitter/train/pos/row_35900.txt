I haven't cut myself in 3 days After cutting myself everyday since I was 8, I lost my razor blade and I haven't found it since. My razor blade was really the only thing I cut myself with. I tried a knife, but it isn't really the same, but I still felt something. I don't know how long this will last, but let's just hope it will last long enough. I hid my scars by wearing a hoodie or jacket, but I'll still be doing that, so people don't freak out. Anyways, have a nice day :)
