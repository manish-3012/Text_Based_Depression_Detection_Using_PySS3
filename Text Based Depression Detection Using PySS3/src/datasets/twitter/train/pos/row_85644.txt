Should I throw my ex under the bus?? I was gonna use a throwaway for this but I canâ€™t.
Iâ€™ve been considering this for months now.

It may seem petty and it may seem like I just want to make her life hell because sheâ€™s with another guy but really itâ€™s not.

I had a girlfriend from August 4th til September 22nd. I assumed it went longer than that but really it was done by the end of September..

Anyway. Iâ€™m 17, sheâ€™s 18 (now 19)
We both go to the same college.
She cheated on me, thatâ€™s why it ended.
It was a short relationship for sure but despite it being that short... she sent me nudes. 

Iâ€™ve been contemplating whether I should report her to our staff because she was sending nudes.. ontop of that, before I got together with her she bragged to me that she once skipped College to have sex across the street at a hotel.

The staff know she has this thing where she has tons of relationships.


So.. do I throw her under the bus and tell staff sheâ€™s been sending nude imagery to people over the internet ?

If I was to report her ... Iâ€™d have to throw myself under the bus too as I sent some very sexual messages but I may get let off as it wasnâ€™t so bad.
