I cant take school anymore This shit has brought me to my last fucking straw. I've been working the last 5 hours at Walmart on an injured foot after working on schoolwork all day. Come home to find im missing a 5 page essay thats due 1.5 hours ago. Im missing so many assignments and I have no time to myself. I only have Monday and Friday off, and the time I have is so damn limited. Our teacher gave us 48 hours to write A FUCKING FIVE PAGE ESSAY. IM SITTING HERE AT 1:30 FUCKING CRYING BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT. IVE GOTTEN SO LOW MENTALLY THIS YEAR, AND AT WORK, IM  FINE. ITS THIS SHIT THATS KILLING MOTIVATION. I swear dude I'm gonna drop out and get my GED instead. This shits so fucking dumb. I haven't spoken to any of my friends in over 7 months now. I just wish it would all end. As of today, its been 8 months since covid. I spent my birthday alone. I spent the entire summer alone. I've spent the school year alone. I have had no time to do what I want, its just school. Its not a fucking priority anymore, my health is now. PUBLIC SCHOOLS, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THAT YOUVE DESTROYED, FUCKING CHOKE ON A FAT ASS CHODE AND DIE OF ASPHYXIATION FROM CUM.
