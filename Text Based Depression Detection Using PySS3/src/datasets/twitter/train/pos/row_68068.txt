Ya know what's funnier than one dead baby? STOPPING MAKING JOKES ABOUT DEAD BABIES

Listen, I ain't no snowflake, this kind of joke got overused and it was never funny, really.

It's just trying too hard to be edgy i dunno. 

Dark humor is humor first, dark second.

Satiric humor can be harder tho, but that's just my view...
