I think I broke my back I was jumping off an inflatable water slide onto the bottom of it, little did I know the air thing had leave blocking the intake, therefore making it deflated. The thing bottomed out and I hit my tailbone on the ground pretty hard. I couldnâ€™t breathe for a bit. I got off of it once I felt good enough to walk and had to find a chair. By the way, my two best friends who I havenâ€™t seen since January were there with me when this happened so now Iâ€™m having to be apart from them. Anyways, Iâ€™m on my way to urgent care. Wish me luck that I didnâ€™t break my back or donâ€™t have spinal damage.
