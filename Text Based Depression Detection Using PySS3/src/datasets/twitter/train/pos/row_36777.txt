gym class fun so today this girl in gym accidentally sent:

heyyyyyy
gurllllllllllll
look at (my name)
omg sorry
that wasn't talking about the (my name) in our class

and you know what? this happened while our district is promoting kindness because people talked about their bullying experiences in an Instagram post. 

but you know what? I don't give a fuck about her opinion. bitch if she doesn't like what I look like that's her problem.
