I don't know whats going on with me. I'm feel like I'm falling apart quickly, a week ago I was fine, now I just had a couple of panic attacks and cried for an hour. I don't care if you guys say I'm farming shit, I just want to share so I can say this- be careful and watch out for yourselves, realize problems before its too late, I didn't do that now it seems like its all coming so fast. I'm not so bad, but bad enough to have thoughts of suicide, thankfully haven't considered it and hope I never do, I still have friends who are also going through things, worse things, and I absolutely refuse to leave and not help them. Please take care of yourselves, don't make the same mistake I did
