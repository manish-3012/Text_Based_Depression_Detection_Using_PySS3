Are they even my friends? Me and my mates have been friends for so long. We've known each other since we were only 9 years old. But something happened last year between my mom and one of my friend's mom. After that, it was a bit awkward between us, but it was fine again after a month.

But something else happened again and I know that they dislike my mom very much and even talk shit about her in front of me (on discord). They have zero respect for my mom and not much left for me.

  I seriously don't know what to do. I almost cried myself to sleep. I've been feeling miserable for some time now too.

What the fuck should I do?
