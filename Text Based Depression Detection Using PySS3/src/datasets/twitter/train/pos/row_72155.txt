I caught my first fish! Since my i have been in a different town for more than 4 months, i decided to do something to spend some time, i bought a fishing rod. After watching A LOT of youtube tutorials and trying for more than 3 weeks, i caught my first fish!! I tried to upload a picture but there was an error and i couldn't, so i thought I'd post it as text since i could give just a tiny bit of detail.
