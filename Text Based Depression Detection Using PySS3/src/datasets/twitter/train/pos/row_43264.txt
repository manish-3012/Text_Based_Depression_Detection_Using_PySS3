i dont know what to do with my life anymore i just dont know what to do with my life anymore. im fairly introverted and i dont have many friends, im depressed because i isolated myself from pretty much any human contact outside of my family for about 6 months. and i got a gf online about 2 weeks ago but my parents forced me to break up with her and i want to be able to confess to my crush irl but im scared shes gonna reject me and about 2 months ago i tried to open up to my parents and they just took my computer and my phone for no good reason and now im considering self harm which i know is bad but i just hate myself
