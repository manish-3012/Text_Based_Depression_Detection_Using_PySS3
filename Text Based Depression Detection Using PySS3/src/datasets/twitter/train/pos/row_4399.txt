I havenâ€™t spoken to anyone from school since covid began and Iâ€™m going back in 2 days I didnâ€™t leave my apartment for the first 6 months of quarantine.

Aside from my family, Iâ€™ve only spoken to 2 of my friends, and that was on discord while playing games. 

Iâ€™ve gotten even more insecure, and I completely forgot how to handle social interaction. I literally do not know how to speak to people. 

Half the kids in my grade think I switched schools, and they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m coming back this year.

Help.
