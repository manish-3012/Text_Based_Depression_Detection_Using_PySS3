I may have accidentally insulted someone? So, Iâ€™m pretty terrible at making friends, because I am constantly putting my foot in my mouth. A lot. But I sorta made a friend, and we eat lunch together. Iâ€™m pretty sure we just eat lunch together because she doesnâ€™t know how to tell me to leave, but anyways, she called me â€œweirdâ€ and I completely disagree. Itâ€™s almost impossible to be truly weird. To be weird is to do something that is not commonly done, and in a planet with billions of people, thatâ€™s next to impossible. To say you are weird is singling yourself out, as though you have done something billions of other couldnâ€™t. Your â€œweirdnessâ€ would make you special, but the fact of the matter is that your not actually weird. That comforts me, and I told her that when she called me weird. But she got really upset for some reason and left? I donâ€™t really know what I said, but I donâ€™t really know what to do either. Any advice?
