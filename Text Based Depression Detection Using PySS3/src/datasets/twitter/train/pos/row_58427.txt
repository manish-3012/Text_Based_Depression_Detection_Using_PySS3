Goddamn it I hate school musicals My dad is pressuring me into performing in the school musical I did it last year and Iâ€™m just not in the mood to do it this year. This year the school is performing Now. Hear. This. I just donâ€™t want to do it, itâ€™s not a requirement, yes I like ACTING, but HATE MUSICALS. this is fucking ridiculous. My dad forced me to do it last year but I donâ€™t want to this year
