A moment of introspection or just thoughts that I want to share with someone I have a little crush on my classmate. We've already had some talks together and I guess we have quite a lot in common. I made some posts asking how to start talking with him more and I received some really good advices

But the thing that I understood is that none of that advices will work if I won't just start talking to him. And yea, the most interesting discovery for me was the fact that my problem isn't the thing that I don't know how to chat with him or that I don't know how to attract him. The only problem I have is that I'm afraid of looking strange or dumn or something like. Like, in general, afraid to start a more or less long conversation with him

So yeah, I thought that the problem was in talking but real one was in my fear
