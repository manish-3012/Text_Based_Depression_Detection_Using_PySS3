I feel really bad not being able to donate to Wikipedia I was checking out the Wikipedia page for Body Mass Index and then donation thing popped up. I don't have a bank acc yet so I can't donate yet. 
So I scroll a little bit more (I'm on viewing the page on my phone) and then the popup comes from the bottom of the screen.
WHAT DO I DOOOOO

I feel really bad. . .
