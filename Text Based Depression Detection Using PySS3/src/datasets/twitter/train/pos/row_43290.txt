Has anyone ever experience a classroom where everyone just hated each other? I was looking back at those school days and I suddenly remembered that I never had a class were my classmates hated each other. Mostly everyone was chill with each other. Even if there were people that had conflict with each other they never got put in the same class. Has anyone experience a class where everyone hated each other and how was it?
