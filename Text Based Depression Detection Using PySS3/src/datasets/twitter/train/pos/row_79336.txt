How the hell do you get a driverâ€™s license? I canâ€™t drive because my dad never bothered to teach me. I canâ€™t practice driving because my family doesnâ€™t have an old car for me to practice with. I canâ€™t afford driving classes. My family didnâ€™t have the money(and still donâ€™t) to buy a car when I turned 16. Even if I did get my license somehow, I canâ€™t afford a new car so Iâ€™d still have to rely on my driving family members or Uber to get to school and work.
