I asked a girl if she wanted to hang out and study on the weekend and she ignored me I thought we were really hitting it off so I thought â€œfuck itâ€. I know shes read it because she has been active after i wrote to her. Maybe I fucked up, should probably have waited a bit longer. Idk, shit hurts. 

I think Iâ€™ve got a nice personality and it seemed like she liked me. Iâ€™m not very good looking so that might be it. Maybe

Anyone have any advice on how I should take it from here? Thanks.
