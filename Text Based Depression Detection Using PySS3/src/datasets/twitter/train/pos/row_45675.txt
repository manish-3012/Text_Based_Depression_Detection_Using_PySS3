another painful year... ( sorry for bad spelling and grammar iâ€™m on mobile) 
* sigh * guess i should say it sense no one else will... happy fvcken birthday to me .... another year another reason. my birthday has never been special, no one really cares about me so i just stopped telling people all together. itâ€™s currently some time at 1 am i just spent the last hour listening to the Ruru tribute song then i realized its now september 30th just another normal day, besides the fact i survived another year, but thatâ€™s probably just because iâ€™m to muck of a coward to die on purpose. sorry i just needed to vent so i did it here. hope to rules were broken sorry if they were!
