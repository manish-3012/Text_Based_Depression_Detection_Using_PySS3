Posting evil facts about historical figures you love until I stop being a cynical asshole day 12: Dwight Eishenhower He was Supreme Leader of the Allies in World War Two and president in key points in the Cold War, but perhaps his hero status is exaggerated?

He is called a war hero, but not once has he seen war. He was stationed in the mainland in World War One and did all of his work in an office in a city far away in World War Two.

As president, there were key issues he ignored. One thing was Brown vs. The Board of Education, in which he could have been a powerful voice for either side, but he wasn't, even after Brown won.

He also ignored Joesph McCarthy as he investigated innocent people as parts of the Communist Party (wish isn't even illegal) with flimsy evidence, and these accusations ruined many of their lives. Eishenhower was verbally against his actions, but ultimately did nothing.

Speaking of Communism, he also passed the Communist Control Act of 1954 (so did nearly all of Congress) which denied any person or organization that the government deemed "Communist infiltrated" protection by the First Amendment.
