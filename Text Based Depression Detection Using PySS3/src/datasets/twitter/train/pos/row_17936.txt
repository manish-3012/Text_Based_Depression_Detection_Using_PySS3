Just gonna vent here if you guys dont mind I dont know if it's just me but its really hard for me to make friends. First of all it was decently easy for me to make friends in school but ever since this pandemic I dont get to see them or talk to them. Another reason is that it's hard for me to talk to other people because I'm afraid they won't like me or I embarrass myself. If any of you guys want to help me out you can, I just have been feeling kinda lonely and I just want someone to talk to and hang out with  most of the day. Thanks for reading this kind redditor :)
