Unpopular operation: The God of the Bible is horrifically immoral and a monster I grew up a Christian, and havenâ€™t been for most of my life. I wouldn't say I'm out of it entirely, but I'm certainly on the very edge of the fence about my familyâ€™s belief. The main reason I'm considering leaving my faith is the problem of evil, I'll elaborate on it in my own way in this post and will also mention the answers I usually get to it from the debates and discussions I've had on it, and why they're unconvincing to me, and are also invalid and embarrassing, in my view. 

Here's a display of the problem of evil for those not aware of it : "Is God willing to prevent evil but not able ? Then he is not all powerful. Is he able but not willing ? Then he is evil. Is he both able and willing ? Then where does evil come from ? Is he neither able nor willing ? Then why call him God ?" -Epicurus 

Here's a chart that clarifies the line of reasoning more (and is sort of a TL;DR for this, but not entirely) : [The Epicurean Paradox](http:// https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQaM2iDol4ZfPeynmst94SIKv1gfQL25jcBrRMW4vpuGK1PFdgN&amp;usqp=CAU)

Here are some statistics for the sake of reference : 

-Every 40 seconds somebody commits suicide. 

-Every day 1660 people die of cancer. 

-Every day 25,000 people die of starvation. 

-(According to 2007 figures) Nearly 9 million children under the age of 5 die every year, 70% of them due to very preventable causes.

We live in a cruel, unforgiving, unjust, and absolutely brutal world that any omniscient, omnipotent and omni-benevolent being would be absolutely discredited if ever associated with it. I don't think the Christian God is good, I find him repulsive, mean spirited, unfair, and undoubtedly evil. 

I will elaborate further on why I think that's the case in my responses to the common responses as to not repeat myself, seeing as this is already a very long read. 

***1- You're just being emotional***

This implies that being upset over the evil in the world is somehow irrational or a weak point to suggest that evil shouldn't exist. Why is it that we move towards fixing issues in the world, then ? Partly because we are emotionally inclined to make a better world for ourselves and those around us, even if not all of us do. Better... That's an interesting word. 

***2- Where do you get your morality, then ?***

Easy, I get my morality from the Bible. Wait, But isn't this what I'm criticizing ? No, I'm criticizing the God of the Bible's morality (in terms of his actions), and not necessarily the Bible's morality. Most of the old testament's brutish laws have been overruled by the new testament and Jesus' fulfillment of the law (and thereby ending the need for it to be followed, see the entire letter to the Galatians) so, in current form, I have no issue with the Bible's laid plan for morality. The issue is with the God who doesn't follow his own rules, which bring us to...

***3- God is under no obligation to follow any moral rules***

This is exactly what a dictator's propaganda sounds like; Calling someone, who is so obviously awful, a wonderful example, and even a model to be followed, while their actions say the opposite. It is expected that the people's disillusionment with the picture they are sold on would be enough to sabotage any critical thinking. Here's where this falls apart for the God of the Bible; 1 Corinthians 13 (AMP)...

V4 : "...Love is not jealousÂ orÂ envious." Yet Yahweh is jealous, very destructively so, in fact. Kind of like an abusive spouse. (Deuteronomy 6:15, Exodus 34:14, Exodus 20: 4-6)

V5 : "it is not provoked [nor overly sensitive and easily angered]; it does not take into account a wrongÂ endured." Yet Yahweh clearly has anger issues and loves to describe his furious rage in meticulous detail. (Isaiah 30:27-28, Exodus 32:9,10, Ezekiel 25:17) He also has no issue with keeping records of wrongs and remembering wrongdoings even in someone's children, and grandchildren. (Numbers 14:18, Exodus 20:5, also the whole Bible because original sin, in case you want to call the other examples "righteous anger")

And that's just two verses from only ONE chapter that has God demanding a standard be set for all Christians that he himself doesn't come close to following, but also explicitly opposes as evident by his actions. Even though these are descriptions of his core characteristic, which is love (1 John 4:8). But what if I'm wrong... What if actually-

***4- God uses evil for good/God is purifying or disciplining us.***

Well, if this is enough to convince you, I have a question for you. Could God have achieved the same exact good/discipline/purification through means that don't involve directly or indirectly causing (or using/permitting) suffering ? No ? Then he's not omnipotent. Yes ? Then he's not all good, or else he would've done that instead. Applying this response is like using a Canon to send a patient to the hospital, or using a flamethrower to more efficiently take off your shirt. In other words; this would clearly be either the work of: an amateur, an idiot, or a sadist.  

***5- Well, that's just the old testament/a different covenant/a different stage of gradual revelation.***

God should not be accounting for people's culture or lack of understanding by causing unbelievable amounts of harm, then turning around and calling Jesus a full revelation of himself or saying the older covenants weren't complete, or the testaments changed. Stoning is not okay now, but it was back then. And so is this discussion (Leviticus 24:13-16), which if I had back then would've had me on the receiving end of a barrage of rocks and stones, thrown by bloodthirsty tribal people who have been raised to believe this is the most moral thing to do, until I arrive at a very painful death.

That which is not okay now, according to God, never should've been. Jesus makes Yahweh sound like his drunk psychopathic uncle. That's just how jarring and drastic and irreconcilable the morality of the new testament is with the old. You cannot, with good conscience, call them similar, let alone the same person. 

***6- Satan is the god/king of the earth, blame him.***

How can I ? Let's not forget that God created Satan knowing what he would become and never chose to destroy him, even though he is fully capable of doing it. Not when he falls, or tries to interfere in Adam and Eve's choice, or after he successfully interferes, or at any point since creation until now. Satan is clearly a major source of harm, so why not just chain him up in his infinite torture basement that he's bound to go to, anyway ? 

The only supposed explanation I've seen to this point is a link between (1 Corinthians 6:3) and (Hebrews 1:14) that claims the reason is that fallen angels (Satan included) were supposed to serve us, and therefore it's us who should judge them, not God, that's why they remain free for now. That's like a doctor refusing to close up a patient's potentially fatal wound because his father isn't there to watch. The least to be said about it is that it's infuriatingly cruel. 

Satan only exists and continues to operate and commit all sorts of evils and atrocities because God allows it, God isn't just an accomplice here, he's the Mastermind. And if you're among those saying God can't do anything about it because he can't interfere in a domain that's not his, or break his own rules.. I hope you realize you're calling God stupid. Because if he knew these rules would one day limit his goodness, or ability to be the most good, he shouldn't have made them in the first place. And don't even get me started on Job. 

***7- I guess you'll just have to blame Adam and Eve!/we live in a fallen world.***

Again, you're pointing at the wrong person for blame. What Adam and Eve did is that they ate a fruit. The major idea there is that God put a "do not eat" label on there, and a promise that they'll die if they eat from it. So, who sets the consequences ? God. Who constructed the mechanism on which original sin operates, thereby stripping us of choice and tying the nature of our existence to our ancestors' mistakes ? God. Who could've made a system in which all of this wouldn't have happened ? God. 

The fact that a world exists where evil overflows and spreads like a cancer into everything and everyone is something God saw eternity past, and still, he went through with it. He saw every child raped, every man and woman enslaved, every soldier shot, all those bedridden while disease eats them alive, all those afflicted with crippling mental illnesses, disaster permeating through our planet to the very core,  yet he remained unflinching in his will to make this world. To go through with this creation project, while entirely aware of the horrific downside. He should've done better, he should've known better, there is no excuse. 

***8- What about free will !?***

"Free will", what a joke. I see people using free will as an answer like it's some sort of an Ace in the hole. If you will it to fly and jump off a building, will you fly ? No. If you make a choice to be a millionaire and snap your fingers and will really hard, will it happen ? No. So, there are natural limitations to our choices, aren't there ? Who set those limitations there and constructed the laws of reality ? God. So why is it that we have a choice available to completely and utterly destroy ourselves with the previous knowledge that we would make it ? 

Our free will is already limited, couldn't God have gone just this one step further ? Death should never have been an option. To grant it is a vile affliction, a senseless brutality, a cruel and sadistic joke. You wouldn't get mad at the pilot for not letting you open the window to an airplane, he clearly has more concern for your safety than your absolute freedom. Would our free will be lacking had we been denied the choice of death ? Indeed. But think of how much pain and suffering and destruction and agony humanity would've been spared had God simply done this, plus, it's already limited, so what difference does it make ? 

You might say that death is just the logical opposite of God. Well, according to whom ? Whose rule is this ? Who could've made reality into something completely different where there's no need for eternal conscious torture that is too brutal a punishment for anything imaginable ? God. According to Jesus, most people that have ever lived will go to hell for eternity (Matthew 7:13-14), this is a truly unenviable world we live in, and if this is the best possible one, then God should've known better and not created at all. He is clearly too hostile and dangerous to sustain a good creation. 

He is a prideful and unrelenting figure, whose tyranny exceeds any of those we have in our history, he takes himself way too seriously, that's why free will to us allowed our death, and the consequence of eating the fruit wasn't much lighter and more reasonable, it is how one is executed for daring to follow one's nature, and be imperfect. To question or oppose Yahweh, that's death, that's how he likes it to be. People have done many evils in the world, but remember, this could've been better, and could've been prevented from before it ocurred. And there's only one world creating, all powerful, time traveller that we know about, his name is Yahweh. 

***9- God doesn't really know everything/isn't all powerful and that's okay.***

No it isn't. It also directly contradicts (1 John 3:20) which explicitly says He is all knowing, and (Jeremiah 32:17, Job 42:2, Matthew 19:26) that say he is all powerful. 

***10- This is God's judgement for people's evildoing.***

So, let me get this straight... You're telling me that the creator of the universe is not only concerned with petty squabbles and territorial disputes, but has no better solutions for them than chopping eachother's heads off ? For what ? Saying he isn't God ? Yahweh here emulates a child throwing his toy against the wall for refusing to say "I love you" back. And what of the children that were slaughtered, what was their crime ? (1 Samuel 15:2-3) or perhaps it was because they sacrificed them, so he ordered them killed too, anyway ? 

What of the Virgin girls "given" with the many horrible and vile implications of that term, given to men who murdered their entire families! (Numbers 31:17-18) does God stop this mess ? Perhaps you haven't been paying attention, this type of God demands a portion of the girls as tribute, then leaves the rest to the men, did you expect him to speak in their favor, perhaps ? (Numbers 31:25-40) who without a second thought commands men to kill their brothers or neighbors or partners (Exodus 32:27-29) 

Then he has the gall and audacity to say he doesn't enjoy the deaths of those who die. (Ezekiel 18:32) all the while delighting in graphic descriptions of ruin and genocide (Isaiah 34:2-3), does this sound fair to you ? Is this someone you would worship, if not for the threat of hell ? Because you genuinely love them ? Even if some of those killed had deserved death, who is really to blame here ? Who made them and put them into such a world and culture and time ? Playing chess against the fundamental idea of opposing him, with sentient beings as pawns made in his own image, the image he violates by countless incitements of senseless violence, within the context of a creation in which the instance of their failure was not only expected, but inevitable. 

***11- it doesn't matter, you won't care about any of this in heaven.***

That's like someone stabbing you, then stitching you up, and paying your hospital bills. That doesn't explain or justify the stabbing, though. 

***12- you've done evil too, what makes you think you can judge God ?/what's a better creation, then ?***

Frankly, I don't have to be a professional chef to say your food is burnt, and therefore awful, even if I don't know how to fix it or have a better recipe. I don't have to give you a better scenario for creation just because I'm saying this is terrible, the burden of figuring out a better way is on God, not me. Plus, you criticize all the other religions' gods with meticulous detail and ruthless questioning, even though theirs also claims to be an infinite God. Unsurprisingly, that defense works for neither of you. 

***13- We don't know, we may never know, our tiny brains can't comprehend God's mysterious ways!***

This is, by far, the most popular one. I'm certain I've unintentionally answered this somewhere up there, that's how absurd this response is. But let me add to your agony in reading this whole thing, why don't you; This response is nothing short of profoundly insulting. This is an author apologizing for his character's poorly described motivations and shrouding him in a veil of mystery to shield his shortcomings. 

Put simply; God owes us an explanation. We're his greatest ever creation, he apparently loves us so much as to die for us, he gave us tons of books that divulge tons of information about himself, yet he sees it appropriate to NOT express his motivations fully ? What does his being so mysterious achieve, exactly ? Why not let us in on it, make it known to us exactly what he wants us to do and why ? Wouldn't this be a greater motivator to follow him, because he's transparent and therefore trustworthy ? A lot of Christians reject this "mysterious ways" thing, yet some hold on to it, and it's honestly sad.  

***14- The character of Jesus redeems Yahweh's***

If a law abiding citizen claims to be the same person as a mass murdering maniac, that doesn't redeem the mass murdering maniac. And even if it was proven, that still doesn't excuse it, no matter what the murderer's intentions or true purposes were, he is still a murderer. If the God of the old testament was put on trial in a modern court, he'd be given a million life sentences. Not that I think Jesus is perfect or agree with his plan by sacrificing himself to himself, but that's a topic for another discussion. Point is, it's too much of a strain on any person with a conscience to call them the same person, not that it makes Yahweh look any better. 




Whew, that took a while. So, this is my case against the Christian God, his nature, his so called goodness, his misguided actions, and his absolute disaster of a creation. I've shown why he is either an impotent fool, an all knowing villain, or perhaps just an apathetic and distant deity. If you have a better response to the problem of evil or would like to further explain any of the responses I responded to, feel free to do so. I'm open to correction and civil debate. But, I will not compromise unless I am convinced, and will give reasons for why I'm unconvinced, if that's the case.
