I hate talking with people. I simply feel like I can't connect with anyone, everytime I try to contribute someone interrupts me, so in the end I just stay silent awkwardly. The more I interact with other people in university the more I realize how much I prefer to be alone, with my own thoughts.

After a call with a group in discord I just couldn't think anything other than "What a waste of time" in a pretty neutral mood. Why do I continue to interact with these poeple? Maybe am I masochist?

Just some thoughts I felt I needed to get out of my system. I hope I'm not the only one that feels like this.
