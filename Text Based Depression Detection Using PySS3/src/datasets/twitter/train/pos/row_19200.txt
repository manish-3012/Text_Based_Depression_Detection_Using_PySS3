Losing weight at 17 without crazy diet? Im 17. used to be pretty skinny but now Iâ€™m fat. Quarantine has definitely helped with putting on some weight but Iâ€™m ready to get rid of it, doing a huge number on my confidence and self esteem.

Anyone got tips? I want to eat normally though, no crazy diets or anything, mainly want some before bed workout routine? Iâ€™m really busy throughout the day.
