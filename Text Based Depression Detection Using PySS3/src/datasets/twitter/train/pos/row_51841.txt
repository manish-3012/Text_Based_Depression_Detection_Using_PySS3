politics based on ideology is just Delima modern politics is not based on ideology anymore. it is just two cults justifying the actions of their leaders even if it didn't incline with the core value of their ideology. conservatives are trying to be rebellious and liberals are trying to cancel comedians for crossing the line. Biden saying ''you are not black if don't vote me'' is getting justified because trump said a much-worse thing. body shaming is bad till it happens to trump. some conservatives are trying to oppose the free market, saying the anti-government stuff, opposing vaccines because their cult leader trump said them to. people are saying they are liberals/conservatives but their actions are completely opposite of the ideology they supposed to follow. world leaders are shifting from the policy-based leader (a leader whose policy inclined with their ideology) to personality-based. and it is getting scarier because now the action of political groups is getting unpredictable
