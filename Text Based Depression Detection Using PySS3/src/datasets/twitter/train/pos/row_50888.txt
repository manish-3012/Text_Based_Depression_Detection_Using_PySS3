Santa is fake I have known for awhile that santa may have been fake but had no proof to prove that theory.

For Christmas this year I found a few presents and I thought it was just my parents giving it to us but then when my sister opened the presents from suppodly "santa" it was the same presents I found in our travel bag.

I felt a bit heart broken that santa is fake and i have proff and I don't wanna tell my parents because I like satisfaction of getting presents from Santa and I like getting extra presents.

I know alot of you already know but what would you guys do or did at this situation?
