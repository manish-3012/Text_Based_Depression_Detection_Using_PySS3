love life moment elementary school:

*crush likes playing basketball*

try playing basketball

"stop stop he's traveling"

me: i am not cut out for this

except for when i was on the school announcements for the first time and she said i did good that was cool

middle school:

me and girl are friends

friend and girl are also friends though

they date it doesn't work out

slowly drift apart but shes in my high school lol

haven't spoken to her since like 8th (im in 10th now for reference)

high school:

9th grade

me and girl dont even talk

one day in latin class gives out a paper for us to write down phone numbers so we can make a group chat

ends up not making it and someone else makes an instagram one

she texts my number to ask for help

i am annoying and pushy and so i get blocked for one year

10th grade comes around

we're in psych and she dms me through meeting chat bc she missed something and i explain it to her

a sort of unspoken understanding comes between us and she dms me on ig apologizing for blocking me and telling me about how i reminded her too much of her stalker

we talk for a few months but huge surprise im still pushy and unbeknownst to me at the same time she's losing another friend so she pushes me away

she apologizes a month later and im fine with it but we dont talk anymore and i lose feelings (lets gooo)
