Iâ€™m going to boarding school soon and Iâ€™m really nervous Itâ€™s on the opposite coast (I live in the us) so Iâ€™m not used to the weather and with corona thereâ€™s a ton of restrictions. They make sense but it kinda dampens a lot of the reasons I chose boarding school. Also I have to leave all my friends in my city after not being able to hang out over the summer. Iâ€™m just freaking out after being super optimistic for a new start. Any advice for moving/calming nerves, or if youâ€™ve attended boarding school what were your freshman experiences like?
