can someone please comfort me one of my dogs broken their ankle and can barely walk and cant poop. my sister has an expensive ass broken foot too, so were not doing good with money. but thats not the worst of it, my dog, cookie, shes only 4 she has pancreatitis for assumed the rest of her life and has to eat lame food so i cant give her treats ever again, thats not too bad, but the worst thing is cookie has eaten countless rubber bands and isnt doing very good, her surgery also costs 3k and the reason why shes so sick is because of me, sometimes my rubber bands would fall onto the floor, i guess she ate them, i was asked to take care of her for the last couple days and it was like she was dying, shes always been such a crazy and fun puppy, but shes so sad and in so much pain lately it hurts so much.
