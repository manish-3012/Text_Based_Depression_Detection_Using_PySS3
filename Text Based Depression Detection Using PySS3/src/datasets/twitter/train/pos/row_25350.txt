I do be conflicted doe :/ A bit over a week ago my best friend had a freak meltdown. Her dad took her to a hospital and they put her on mood shit, she then got anti psychos and after that she completely disappeared off the face of the planet. Iâ€™ve been too scared to stop by her house but every time i pass seeing her car and stuff makes me upset. Itâ€™s weird though she wouldnt just abandon everything, especially me:( itâ€™s been a minute so now Iâ€™m just assuming shes in a mental hospital and Iâ€™m hoping she comes back soon, idk this is more of like a vent if anything. My dumbass is just upset she didnt warn me or anything but then again she didnt say anything to anyone and im trying not to blame her bc i know shes not herself :(
