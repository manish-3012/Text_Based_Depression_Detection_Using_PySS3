My mate always needs a poo on dates I posted a year and a bit ago about a friend of mine who got locked in a bathroom with his crush, and took a dump instead of making a move. They somehow ended up dating(???). I've heard little from him since.

Anyways, flash forward to about a week ago, I've just finished a shift at work and as I'm leaving I hear someone shout my name, and its him.
I haven't seen him in over 6 months and his first words to me are "thank goodness I've found someone I know, I'm waiting for a date and I really need a shit do you know any nearby bathrooms?" 
I guess he's just a nervous shitter?
