This pandemic is really teaching extroverts what it's like to be an introvert, huh My girlfriend just told me "when all this shit wasn't happening, I never had a dull moment. I never felt alone, I always had someone to talk to."

I thought everyone went through that and picked up the internet because of it. The only reason this pandemic doesn't seem to bother me is because my weekends were like this before. Inside all day, not knowing what to do with myself and looking at the clock tick. That's how I found video games. That's how I found my friends, from across the world. That's how I found music, the music that I really love. That's how I learned how to deal with my feelings on my own. It's so crazy that people don't share those weekends staring at the wall. Anyway, vent over. If anyone has suggestions on how to help her deal with this, that would be much appreciated as well :)
