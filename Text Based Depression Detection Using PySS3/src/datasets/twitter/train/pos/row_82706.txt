I'm standing alone in the street with a sword and people are looking at me weirdly So I'm 15, I live in Rome, and I've been doing martial arts for 7 years now. I'm supposed to have my lesson now, but the instructor said he is late, I've been waiting here for 45 minutes, and people are looking at me like :"what the hell is some weirdly dressed kid doing on a pavement with a sword?". That's exactly what I look like right now, my battery is low so I'll check in later.
