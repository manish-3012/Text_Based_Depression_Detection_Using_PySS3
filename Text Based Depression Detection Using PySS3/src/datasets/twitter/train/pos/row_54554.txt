Will pay someone for assistance on my chemistry lab (Gen Chem 2 college) I just performed this lab and Iâ€™m genuinely lost on it. Itâ€™s due by 5:50 EST today so I donâ€™t have time to read a book on it. 

This is gen chem 2 college if your experience w chemistry extends to HS Iâ€™d say this is out of your knowledge zone. 

Itâ€™s on initial rates. Finding concentration, rate laws, etc. 

I will Venmo/PayPal whatever if someone can help me. The lab sheet isnâ€™t lengthy at all.
