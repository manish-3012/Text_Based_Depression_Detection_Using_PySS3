My mother's not the best... So, last week I got my grades. They were not the best by any means, but they were close. My mother got really mad at me, took my phone, banned me from using my computer and from closing my door. After she yelled at me for about an hour I went to my bed, curled to a ball and cried myself to sleep. It was noon though, and she woke me up 45 minutes later with the excuse of "You're so fragile" and that "You always have been like your father" (My father is indeed an asshole and she knows that I hate it when she compares me to him). I didn't really eat for the next 2 days and after that she decided to give me my phone back... She also became a bit more relaxed with the initial orders she had me on from the day I got my grades. The week passes, a new week starts and I decided to stay a tiny bit late (instead of sleeping at 1:00 AM I decided to move it to 1:30 just so I can finish up some stuff) and my mother told me to go sleep at 12:30 and I told her that I'll stay one more hour. I think she didn't even hear me. She stormed in my room at about 1:10 and started yelling about me disrespecting her (meanwhile she was using her phone all the time when she had taken mine from me) and that "You think I'm something standard", whatever that means, and she took my phone yet again, exactly a week after she initially took it from me. I didn't really eat the last 2 days too, I didn't really care... The next day she didn't really talk to me, didn't go into conversations, and was generally closed up and hostile against me. Today I tried numerous times to start a conversation with her, but she would always cut it off early. She was watching something on TV about a kid and her mother and she commented that "She has a child, I don't really have one anymore". I really can't stand looking at her like that, but she doesn't leave me any other choice but to wait. Conversations have never worked. Any advice on this? I honestly am out of ideas.
