anyone else hear ringing in their ear when they hear this song? no this is not a trick to make you listen to black pink, I genuinely need to know if anyone else hears like, a ring, in the background, like the mics are messed up, or smth, I love black pink and this is my fav song of theirs.. but the ringing is just AGH.
