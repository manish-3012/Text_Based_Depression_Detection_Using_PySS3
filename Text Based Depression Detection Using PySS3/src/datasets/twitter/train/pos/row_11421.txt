There nobody at school I like I was never really into relationships or dating until I ask out my crush (she goes to another school) and she said yes Iâ€™d never been happier. Happiest 4 months of this year but I knew it was to good to be true because she said she â€œdidnâ€™t see me that wayâ€ and was crushed and now she doesnâ€™t talk to me anymore. Iâ€™m a very socially awkward person and there nobody at my school I truly like. I never released how much being lonely sucked. Anyways I guess Iâ€™m asking for advice I donâ€™t know anymore. I have friends to talk to but you know how guys are. I donâ€™t really know how to talk to people and I donâ€™t really have any friends that are girls Iâ€™m sorry if I waste your time with this Iâ€™ve just never gone through this anyways thanks for coming to my TED talk
