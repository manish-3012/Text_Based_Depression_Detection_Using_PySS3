I have nowhere to stay Everyone had to evacuate from college last night and my parents donâ€™t want to come back home because of COVID. I got tested the other day and tested negative. But since everyone has to quarantine for 2 weeks my parents donâ€™t want me back home. 

I have nowhere else to go. Nowhere to stay. Not even my parents want me.
