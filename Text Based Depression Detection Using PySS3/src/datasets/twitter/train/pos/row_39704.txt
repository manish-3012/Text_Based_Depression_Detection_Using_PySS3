I lost my 4 year old Minecraft world Iâ€™ve been playing Minecraft for years. Itâ€™s a huge part of my childhood. I remember how excited I was when horses were added. Iâ€™ve made a lot of friends on there and itâ€™s a different pain knowing Iâ€™ll never play with them again because of my older sister who used to find my best worlds and delete them. 
I made a world in 2016. I spawned on an island. I made a hotel so high it reached the limit. I had hundreds of massive houses all in a line with backyards. I improved the village. I added public bathrooms with working toilets. I made colourful,unique buildings and they were stores or cafes or pubs or orphanages,pools,fisherman places,a school,Aquariums,hospitals,police stations with German Shepard, I had cat/dog/ferret/hamster/parakeet and parrot cafes. Adoption centers,customized banners with countries,lgbt flags,a zoo, large bridges that lead to the ice biome so you could look above the polar bears. Farms that were huge. A witch castle. An ikea with furniture. I made my own texture pack and it was beautiful.

So when I got kicked off and went back on,only to find myself in survival,my inventory empty and in the middle of the ocean, I felt awful.

I had a graveyard with the names of my old Minecraft friends so Iâ€™d never forget them,since I have severe memory issues. A huge piece of my childhood just got ripped out. I got attached to that world. I had a section dedicated to little memories of my childhood. I made it because Iâ€™ve forgotten my whole childhood except for the bad things so I made the section because then at least Iâ€™d be able to remember some of it.

And Iâ€™ve lost it all
