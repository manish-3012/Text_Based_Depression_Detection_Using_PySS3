What's it like being a teen during the 2020's (and the Pandemic) Still technically a teen here for a little bit but I wanted to ask how people are doing during these times. This isn't just related to the Pandemic life (as schools have changed so much over the years, hell computers used to be far and few between when I was in school and I'm not even that old consider how older generations must view school nowadays) as I'm interested what being in school is like during the 20's. This isn't also limited to people in school, anyone dealing with higher education or jobs I also want to too know!

What I can judge is that social media is becoming more popular every year (Was quite popular to the end of my time in school but it seems to make up so much of teenagers life these days), I remember earlier in my school years BBM (Black Berry Messenger) was all the rage but now we have Snapchat, Instagram even TikTok. What I am asking here is how prominent these apps are in your life?

How is being in a Pandemic with online classes affecting your school time, as much as I hated school the thought of missing a year of it (In person at least) is quite worrying. Is there going to be a generation with less knowledge or do you think things will remain the same?

Most importantly, what are you dealing with and what are you worried about. As someone who went through a lot at School I am happy to offer some advice/help if you're struggling with work or social issues!
