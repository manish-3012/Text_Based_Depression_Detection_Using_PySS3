Please stop making Trump 2020 jokes, itâ€™s not funny I donâ€™t know who needs to hear this, but putting Trump 2020 on things totally unrelated to politics isnâ€™t funny, you just look like an idiot. If you happen to be the person doing this just consider the fucking situation for two seconds. If youâ€™re in math class working on your review packet for exams now isnâ€™t the time to say it, you add literally nothing to the situation and the only reason people are laughing is because you just said something that was completely asinine or because itâ€™s the trumpies who thought breaking into the capital was a good choice.
