What are your school shooting drills like? Does it affect you emotionally? I read that "[the exercises range from drills in which students and teachers go through the motions of turning the lights off and locking doors, to high-intensity exercises that involve actors portraying gunmen and victims while the sound of gunshots plays](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/active-shooter-drills-are-meant-prepare-students-research-finds-severe-n1239103)".

 in the same article, I found out that "On Jan. 4, 2019, a Twin Lakes elementary school hosted a training conducted by the White County Sheriffâ€™s Office. Deputies shot teachers at point blank range with airsoft guns during a mock execution, leaving staff bloodied and welted", making some of the teachers/staff leave.

I DID NOT KNOW that some places took these too far my school just turns off the light and lock the doors while we continue with our class lecture.
