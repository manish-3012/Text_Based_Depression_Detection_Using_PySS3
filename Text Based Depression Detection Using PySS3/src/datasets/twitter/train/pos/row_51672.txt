MY DIARY.DAY 10: RESTING yeah so it was a rest day...so all i did was, studying, went to post office and got my led light...i put them in my room...evedything good...nothing interesting



Also i realised that everytime when somebody asks me if i am feeling ok...i can't say that i am. I am starting to think that i have depression but i won't tell the details cause there are too much. also i described it in other posts.
