I get hundreds of views a video but have a very small amount of subscribers I have a political commentary channel where I discuss the current state of the presidential and senatorial election and make maps based on certain scenarios and changes in the political sphere. I am unbiased towards any party and make videos solely based on facts and numbers. I currently have 8 videos that range between 100 - 400 views each yet I only have 30 subscribers. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? I'll link my channel below in case you want to see for yourself to see what I may be doing wrong.
