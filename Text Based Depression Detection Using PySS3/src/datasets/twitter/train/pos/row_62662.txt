my parents are being so god damn in my face so im just trying to do school. my parents keep walking in and asking so many questions when im just trying to work. "did you email your teacher about \_\_\_", "are do doing \_\_\_ assignment", "\_\_\_\_ on the face book said \_\_\_" like please shut up and go away

i know that they are just concerned, but if they have to ask me questions about everything when i have breaks or am trying to focus on something, they can wait. i asked my mom where my switch was so i could play animal crossing since one of my classes wasn't working, and she started asking me a million questions just to end with "go read a book, animal crossing is frying your brain." 

IM SORRY, BUT WOULD YOU RATHER ME BEING LYING ON THE GROUND HAVING A PANIC ATTACK BECAUSE YOUR JUST REMINDING ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT VERY CLEARLY STRESSES ME OUT?!

sorry, i just really needed to vent. i like online school a lot more than in person, but i might beg to go back just because i want to get away from my parents.
