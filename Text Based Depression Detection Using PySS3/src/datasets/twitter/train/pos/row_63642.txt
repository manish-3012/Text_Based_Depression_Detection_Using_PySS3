Old fashioned romance is the best. Change my mind. Can you really say that there is anything better than the typical old fashioned romance in relationships..?

i mean.. I donâ€™t know, idk if itâ€™s different for guys. or maybe itâ€™s just me. but random flowers, telling me you miss me, staying up all night talking etc. 

not even no social media, like great stay on socials and stuff but like.. not needing to show the entire world at what stage youâ€™re in in your relationship. Tell me iâ€™m wrong but I think that shows that youâ€™re insecure in your relationship.. 

anyway! i still think theres nothing better than an old fashioned romance.
