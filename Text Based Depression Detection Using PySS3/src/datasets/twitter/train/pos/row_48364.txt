My friend needs help Ok so my friend doesn't have the balls to post on reddit so I'm doing it for her. She has a boyfriend, they have been dating for 4 months, they have only seen each other ONCE, and she thinks she's the only on putting in any effort to this relationship. I told her to break up with him, but she says that she can't do it. She doesn't want to hurt him. So she told me to ask the internet. And here I am. I say break up, they have only seen each other one time, and haven't done any stuff that couples do. They text and facetime but that's it. She feels like shes the only one putting in any effort. So please reddit, tell me what she should do.
