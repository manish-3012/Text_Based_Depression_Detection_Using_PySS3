R.I.P. So my... so my sister's allergic to Mangos. I know, it sucks. And last night, my brother came home from bike practice and gave me a mango coconut water with mango chunks. i didn't really care for it and stuck it in the fridge. then, just a few minutes ago, my dad was like "Who's coconut water is this, and do you want it?" and i was like "It's mine, and nah. didn't really care for it" and my sister wanted it, but she didn't know about the mango chunks in there. so when she took a sip, she gasped in surprise. and i was in the next room, and i just heard a loud gasp and then "oh no". I said "What? what's wrong?" and she said "This has mango chunks in it. i thought it was just mango flavoring." I looked at her and she looked back at me and we both started laughing. i don't know why we found it so funny, but we did.

P.S. Her allergies to mangos aren't like "Oh no gasp wheeze i'm dying i need to go to the ER. it's more like "fuck. this is painful. fuck. fuck. fuck. AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGG PAIN GO AWAY."
