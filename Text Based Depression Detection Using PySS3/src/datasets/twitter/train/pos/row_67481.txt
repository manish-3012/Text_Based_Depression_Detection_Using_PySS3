i'm having a sexuality crisis i was just talking to a femboy i met on this sub, and he's seriously making me question my sexuality. i said i'd questioned whether i was bi and he said "maybe i can make you bi", and we had a whole convo about if i found guys hot, and like - 

i don't know if i find guys attractive or not.

i think i prefer girls, but like i'd be willing to experiment?

i don't know

is anyone else in / has been in this position?
