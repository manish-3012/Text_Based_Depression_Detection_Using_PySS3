An interesting fact about the Japanese Bomber G4M1 Allied Codename â€œBettyâ€ The Japanese military needed a long range bomber with a big bomb load and a very very high speed of and thus Mitsubishi started to design a bomber. The head designer proposed a 4 engined bomber but the military was stupid and said they wanted a 2 engines bomber and thus the G4M1 was born. Virtually no armour was present on the bomber so that it could be fast by shedding weight and the wings were all just tanks of fuel so it was very long range but even if a rifle caliber machine gun sneezed onto the right spot it would explode spontaneously into flames and thus the allied fighters were told not to go too near to it while I was burning because there was a chance of it exploding and taking down the fighter with it. At (almost) the end of the war the Japanese  finally realised that the head designer was right but it was too late the Japanese Air Force was basically a potato and yea thanks for coming to my TED talk
