My best friend of 6 years is ignoring me He asked me out 6 days ago and I told him that I personally wasn't in a good place for a relationship. I've tried talking to him but he's ignored me ever since.

I'm really starting to panic. He's never ignored me like this before, and I don't know what to say to him to make this situation better.

Idk whether to just keep messaging him. I really do like him, it's just that I'm still trying to get past a bad point in my life, and I don't feel like I would be good in a relationship. 

Anyway thanks for listening (if you read all of this haha). I'm feeing really anxious and I think writing it out helps me.
