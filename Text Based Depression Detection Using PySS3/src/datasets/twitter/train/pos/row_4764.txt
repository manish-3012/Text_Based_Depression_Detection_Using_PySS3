do yâ€™all remember stuff? 
so iâ€™m fifteen and i know as time passes you donâ€™t remember everything that happened a couple of years ago. iâ€™m bad at remembering in general so maybe itâ€™s just that. 

i had a traumatic event happen to me in 2014 and i stg i donâ€™t have one single memory of that year. iâ€™m wondering if i have repressed memories because i remember stuff that happened before 2014 and after 2014 but that year is completely gone. 
like my friend and i were talking about elementary school and she was like â€˜omg do you remember when the teacher (...)â€™ and thatâ€™s the first time iâ€™ve ever heard of these things even though we were in the same class. 

i was 8/9 so should i remember something or is it normal to forget everything?
