my first ever relationship and idk tf iâ€™m doing :) i like you man, but like why should i be the one always staring the conversation? 
so hereâ€™s the thing, if i donâ€™t end up saying anything to him, it can go as long to 2 weeks, before we started this relationship he would start it but now like :// 

he makes me happy etc. but itâ€™s not like before as i expected
