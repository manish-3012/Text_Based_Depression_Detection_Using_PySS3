Kinda stuck Hey so within like 2-3 years it feels like lots of others around me, namely my close or once close friends are really going places, making more friends, finding significant others, doing well in school, in shape, etc. I meanwhile am somehow still behind, not 100% sure why though. I think itâ€™s that Iâ€™m either too chill for some people, or not chill enough for others. I think this is in part cause of COVID, and everyone else being more comfortable doing things, going out, etc, meanwhile Iâ€™m still indoors most of the time. I agree with how the rest of my family is going about COVID anyway. 

I never really got tight with as many people, and I donâ€™t usually tend to anymore. I do here and there but thatâ€™s about it. I think I just got partially unlucky with a lot of shitheads in my area, but still. In most to all aspects of life I kinda feel stuck, probably am stuck. Not really sure what if anything I can do about it. So yeah thatâ€™s basically it. Goodnight
