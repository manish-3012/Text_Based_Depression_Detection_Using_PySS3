I was just talking to a girl and I genuinely felt happy for once. Basically I just talked to a girl for like 10 minutes, but it was actually great because I have never talked to this girl before and I rarely talk to ppl. If yâ€™all havenâ€™t done this, I highly recommend it, makes your day brighter. Or it doesnâ€™t even have to be a girl, just someone you havenâ€™t talked to before.
