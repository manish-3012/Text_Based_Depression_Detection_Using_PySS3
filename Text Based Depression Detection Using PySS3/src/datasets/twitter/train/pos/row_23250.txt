Is flirting cheating? I saw a post on instagram about all of the things the poster thinks is cheating and i noticed so many people in the comments saying that flirting and hiding things isnâ€™t cheating. They were justifying it by saying â€œflirting is a natural and helps to show people you want to be friendsâ€. Also, that â€œhiding things doesnâ€™t mean your cheating it means you want to have some privacy in your lifeâ€. 

Personally, i think flirting is cheating. The people using the â€œitâ€™s naturalâ€ excuse most likely cheat and want to justify bad behavior. When someone flirts with another person theyâ€™re showing romantic interest in that other person, so how is that not considered cheating? I donâ€™t flirt with my friends in normal conversation to socialize... 

Also, i saw people saying â€œsome people are friendly and flirty when talkingâ€..... Being friendly is completely different than being flirty. You can be friendly without flirting with someone very easy to do. 

Though, i agree when youâ€™re in a relationship you do need to have a life separate from your partner, even if itâ€™s just friends that you both donâ€™t share mutually. Hiding that your going out with said friends does seem suspicious but i wouldnâ€™t consider it cheating, i would consider it something that should be discussed based on the level of trust in the relationship and whether there is a history of suspected cheating or actual cheating. purposefully hiding an outing isnâ€™t okay.

Honestly though, the things that are considered cheating are different for every relationship. 

What do you guys think? Is flirting considered cheating? Is hiding things from your partner considered cheating?
