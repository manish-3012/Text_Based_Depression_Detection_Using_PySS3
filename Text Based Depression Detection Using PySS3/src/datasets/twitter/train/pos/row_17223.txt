Need Help I am a 16 yr old guy, and pretty tall, about 6 ft or so (give or take some).

Around a month ago, I started fixing my really bad "banana posture" while sitting. Was going pretty well. But for the past 2-3 weeks, I have been having constant back ache. It never seems to calm down.

Hurts especially when I get up from lying down.


Should I be Concerned ? 
Is it because I am stressing my back too much ?
