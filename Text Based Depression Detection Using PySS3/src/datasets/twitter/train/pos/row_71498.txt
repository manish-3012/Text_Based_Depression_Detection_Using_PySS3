Looking back idk how I didnâ€™t die freshman year I was so unhealthy I only got like 4 hours of sleep a night I would drink 2 cokes every day get just a bag of chips for lunch and thatâ€™s all I would eat all day pretty much. I would have weights 5 days a week go to soccer practice 3 nights a week then have a game on The Weekends. And then spring and summer instead of soccer I would have baseball practice 5 nights a week and a game on weekends. I literally shoulda died I was so fucking unhealthy
