Iâ€™m in a fight with a group of friends Iâ€™m in a fight with a majority of my group of friends

So, Iâ€™m in the middle? The beginning? The end? Of a fight with a group of friends. And itâ€™s kind of weird and it really sucks because this doesnâ€™t really happen. There has never been a divide between us. 

Thereâ€™s about 3 different â€œsidesâ€ thereâ€™s two that are pretty heated (Iâ€™m a part of one of them) and the â€œletâ€™s forget about thisâ€ side. And honestly I kind of want to be a part of that side because I really donâ€™t want to be upset anymore. 
 
This is pretty difficult to explain without having to add in several details about each person involved and everyoneâ€™s relations with each other. Itâ€™s not a shocker that this all went down on Discord. 

Anyways, Iâ€™ll just ask generally. How can I possibly remedy this situation, itâ€™s a fight between close friends. Please ask for some details if this is too vague lol, but I just donâ€™t know how to fix things between a split fight or disagreement. Iâ€™m mostly worried about one friend here. Because this person told me to talk to them a week later (understandable but I really donâ€™t think any of us will even have indecisive opinions anymore by that time). They kind of gaslighted me, sounds exaggerated because it is lmao but they kept saying that I was â€œconfusedâ€. 

OKAY BUT YEAH, thanks :,,,,)
