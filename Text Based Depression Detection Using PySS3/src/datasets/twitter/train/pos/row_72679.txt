School starts tomorrow Thatâ€™s right guys itâ€™s my first day of highschool tomorrowðŸ˜”
Iâ€™m really anxious because Iâ€™m high risk and Iâ€™m being forced to go to school 
Iâ€™m getting so anxious to the point of throwing up. So many bad things happened this year with people from my school so I really just do not wanna see them. 

How do I control my fear?
Oh also how do I make my dark circles better? Iâ€™ve been sleeping well for weeks but they arenâ€™t gone yet. 
Please help me
