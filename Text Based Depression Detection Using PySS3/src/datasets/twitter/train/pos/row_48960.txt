how do i get a guy to know i like him lol so im f16 and i have had a crush on this guy in my chemistry class for so long, we have really similar interests (politics, videogames etc.) but i have no idea how to hint at him that i like him. we dont speak outside of school because he's kinda nerdy and doesn't have that much social media. any suggestions on letting him know apart from straight up telling him lol (i am wayy to scared of rejection for that)
