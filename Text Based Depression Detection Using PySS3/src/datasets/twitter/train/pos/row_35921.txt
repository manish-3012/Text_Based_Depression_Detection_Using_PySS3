A rant about the word â€œsimpâ€ Boys can be friends with girls without being a simp. The word has been completely removed from its meaning and is now way too overused. It makes boys extremely uncomfortable getting  together with girls as they were worried about their public image. People need to stop using the word and just let boys be friends with girls.
