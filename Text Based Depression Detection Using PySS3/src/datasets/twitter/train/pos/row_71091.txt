i cant online school anymore where i live the school year finishes by the end of november. but i think we're gonna have school in march and april next year. im a senior in high school. and well the thing is that i haven't been to any online classes in like three weeks. im too tired, im not learning anything, i cant talk out loud in class. i dont know what to do. i dont think its worth it to go to classes. id rather do them next year not online when i can actually learn something and not be a dumbass in university. that being said, i feel like i'll never finish high school. im not dumb, i got straight as the last few years, but i cant like this. its not like im failing a lot of classes, but idk. i feel stupid, im not learning anything and i dont have friends in school to help me. soo yeah, i hate this
