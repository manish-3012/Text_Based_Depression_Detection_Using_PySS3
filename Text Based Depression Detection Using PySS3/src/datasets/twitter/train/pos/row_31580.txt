Don't Confuse Idealism with Attraction For those of you who have crushes, please avoid putting them upon a pedestal, and idealizing a relationship with them.

Based on what Iâ€™ve seen in this sub, most of you have known your crushes for maybe three or two months at most; at that point, unless the crush is very open about themselves, you likely don't know much about them.

The reverse is also true.

Not to mention, putting a false idea of a person in your head can be very damaging when that mirror youâ€™ve created is shattered.
