Welp, grandma has a boner There was an old extension of my family who all had severe depression, it was a mother, father and 2 daughters. The mother had "broken" and just dealt with it after the father committed suicide. She stayed with the 2 daughters and was moving states via car, the daughters where asleep when the mother left the car on railroad tracks and abandoned them. They didnt wake up. The mother hasn't been found, if she's alive and makes contact with us, we kill her.
