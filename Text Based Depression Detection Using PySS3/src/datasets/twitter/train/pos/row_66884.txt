I have to go back to school and i dont have a choice I dont want to do in person school. My parents are doing this so I can get "better grades" and I just started getting my grades back up and now I have to go back to school. I have to go like 2 weeks into the quarter which I feel like im gonna do something wrong which doesn't help my never ending social anxiety. I also don't want to get sick and fucking die. I don't want to go back but I guess my fucking opinion doesn't matter
