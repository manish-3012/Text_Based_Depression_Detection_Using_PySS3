Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m making it through the day lmao I just finished a paper that I have due and itâ€™s 3am and I have an opening shift in the morning so Iâ€™m thinking Iâ€™ll just pull an all-nighter at this rate because I have to get up soon anyways, stop at the gas station on the way to work, hammer a few Red Bullâ€™s, try to get through my shift, drive home without crashing, sit through 5 hours of my 2 hardest classes, watch the Dodger game, and holy fuck I am gonna be dead by the end of the day
