Offering genuine advice â¤ I am fairly young, 24, but I have been through a long range of hardships and even, recently, some successes.

Childhood trauma, mental health/suicide, physical health, a true near death experience, relationships/marriage/divorce, addiction, self care/love. 

If you are looking for answers, advice or just an ear who will listen, please feel free to comment/message me at any time.
No judgement. 

I genuinely enjoy helping others and believe that all my experiences have happened for a reason. Currently, my reason is to share those experiences/advices with others, in hopes of atleast one person taking something away from what I have to say.
