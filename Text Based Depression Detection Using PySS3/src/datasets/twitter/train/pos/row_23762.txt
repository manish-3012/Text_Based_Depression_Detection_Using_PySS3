Shy introverts of reddit, how could I know if you would like to have a conversation? Title is self explaining. I lack social skills to see this my self so that's why I come to reddit for your great advice.

I ask this for irl and online conversations.

Edit: I am an introverted person as well, but in lonely times like these, because of the pandemic going, it is nice to have some social interaction in my opinion.
