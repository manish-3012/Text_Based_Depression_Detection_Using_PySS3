I want to ask out my crush but I feel it may lead to a disastrous school year | (15M) want to ask out my crush (15F) but I feel like she is unapproachable and she is my good friend and has been my best friend for 2 year but we never even cam close to talk about love or anything and I feel like if I ask her out, it may lead to disastrous events in our friendship . But I have been attracted to her for all my time in school and I seriously want to ask her out for a date but I also feel that she may complain about me (this seriously happens in India) to our teacher as it has happened before. We have a very great friendship and she lives nearby to my house . Should I just gather the courage and ask her out and suffer the consequences if she disagrees or should I approach this situation in a different manner?
