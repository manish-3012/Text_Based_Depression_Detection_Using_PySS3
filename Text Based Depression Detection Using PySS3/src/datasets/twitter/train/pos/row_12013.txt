Advice needed for friends and stuff Aight so I go to a private, all boys school in a major city, and Iâ€™ve been going since 7th grade (first grade that you can go to the school). The schools cool, there are kids from all over the metro area that commute in everyday (ex Iâ€™m abt 30 miles away). 

Now, Iâ€™m in 9th grade. I have a great friend group that Iâ€™ve had since 8th grade and everythingâ€™s going well. In the beginning of this year in my geometry class I was trying to get to know some new kids to expand my friend circle and I met this kid, weâ€™ll call him C. Heâ€™s wicked chill, great to hang with during class, but I noticed he doesnâ€™t have any friends in school (I get it, corona, shits difficult this year). Itâ€™s weird, because most of the people that are alone at school are weird or thereâ€™s a reason, but C is completely normal and has a ton of friends from his hometown (1 town away from me). Weâ€™ve played PlayStation together for like 6 hours a day for the last few days and weâ€™ve all around hit it off

My question is, what do I do next? I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m a popular kid, Iâ€™ve got a bunch of friends that Iâ€™d say are about average on popularity, maybe slightly above, like I am. But C seems like he would be wicked popular if, you know, given the chance. I donâ€™t wanna mess this up, because weâ€™ve really hit it off, but at the same time I wanna play it cautious and donâ€™t wanna go overbearing on him. My current friend group I kind of just clicked with, but itâ€™s different with C. I really just donâ€™t know what to do from here, I just donâ€™t want to be overbearing and also donâ€™t wanna be detached, and I wanna like keep up/begin our friendship right. I hope you guys know what I mean
