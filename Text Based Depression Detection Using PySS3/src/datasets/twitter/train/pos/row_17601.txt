Heard something in spanish class We were watching a video on reflexive verbs in spanish class, and the guy said "the man is the one doing the action and the car is the one receiving the action. It made me think of a guy having sex with a car. How would he do that, though? Also, the same guy was trying to hypnotise his dog. Weird video.
