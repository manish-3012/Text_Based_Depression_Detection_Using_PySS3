Aight, I def got like a mental block or som with girls Long story short with back story, there is a girl at my job that im interested in and anytime she talks to me or I have a chance to talk to her, I choke on my words, stutter, or say something dumb that makes me seem like I don't want to talk.

So on Monday after work, I needed a ride home and I was just waiting outside my work until one of my parents answered and she walks out and walks past me at first, and then I see her turn around and she just offers me a ride home. I froze right there and in my head I was screaming "say yes" and my first words are literally "nah, im good, thanks tho". I have been beating myself up since then, like wtf, that was a perfect chance for us to talk but no, like every single time I choke and freak out.
