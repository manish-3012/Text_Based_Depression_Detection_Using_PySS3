So i have this girl i liked So I have a girl I like but every guy likes her and she is also a big flirt with everyone but me. It's been a full year since my last crush and I've been finally trying to get back into the crush-ing game(i know that sounds cringe) and idk if this is a sign that she as a slight interest in me or if she just doesn't like me

I'm homeschooled so relationships and flirting are really hard so I'm coming on here to ask for help
