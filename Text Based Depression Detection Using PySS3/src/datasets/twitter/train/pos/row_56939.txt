Lmao school really expects me to attend class every day like we live in a utopia while Iâ€™m here tryna end my own life by thinking about suicide cuz I canâ€™t actually do it so Iâ€™m just hoping yet Iâ€™m not and hearing my parents argue saying shit like my mom coulda just left if she wanted to or how my dad always called her hurtful shit which could definitely make someone feel worthless. 

Lemme fuggin stay home a few times a year or something at least without having to fake being sick to a doctor to get his approval which also costs me 5â‚¬ which like what if I didnâ€™t have those ffs. 

Education can suck my nuts like it wonâ€™t help me when Iâ€™m dead will it. Besides Iâ€™ll forget most of the shit like as soon as Iâ€™m home anyway 

Like bruh cut people some slack will ya

I just want to have a little peace in mind like pretty much everyone else id assume.
