I've been watching stick and poke tutorials and I think I'm going to do it. I don't know, my body is already pretty fucked up. Its not going to effect me to badly. I'm pretty good with making sure wounds don't get infected, and I think I can be pretty safe about it. 

I'm going to start getting an allowance soon, and I think I'll buy the right type of ink and a small first aid kit. 

I think I want to do a couple small flowers or stars on my upper thighs.
