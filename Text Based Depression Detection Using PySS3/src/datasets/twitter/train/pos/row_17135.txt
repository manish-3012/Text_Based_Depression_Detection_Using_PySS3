One of my more odd dreams I had a dream where I was being chased by prostitutes in a wheat field. Eventually they all caught up to me and surrounded me in a kill circle. But they didnâ€™t attack me. Instead one of them pulled a tv set out of god knows where and placed it on the ground. And it was at that point I realized that they just wanted to watch tv with me. So there we were laying on our bellies, our legs kicked up into the air with the kids show Maya and Miguel playing on the tv.
