Yo I realized something about myself I don't even really post here for other people to enjoy anymore, I do it more so that I get that little red notification and get little spurts of excitement like "what's this notification gonna be" or like when I open the app just to see if someone has commented. I'm really starting to sorta hate it cuz I don't even really enjoy these apps, I just go on them for the little bits of dopamine or whatever. Anyone else feel like that?
