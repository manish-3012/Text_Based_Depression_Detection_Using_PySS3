Goodbye bois, I'm 20 now. I became 20 this week. I must now take my leave. As is customary I'll give ya'll a piece of advice, I hopeit can serve you well, and that is simply to **do shit**. I was held back a lot of times during my teenage years by fear of failure and overthinking. I want to tell you all the piece of advice that changed the way I see failure. The most important thing to remember is that **failure is the only way to learn, success teaches you almost nothing.** So if you ever get the chance to do something, do it, and fail at it, and then try it again now with extra knowledge. I spent so much time playing video games in my room hating myself, I didn't even enjoy the games I played anymore, I just wanted to avoid boredome. I want you all who are in that same position I was to know that you can get out. It wasn't easy, it took uninstalling my games and wasting an entire month doing literally jackshit in my bed. You can all get out of it.
