Hey does anyone wanna play Among Us on discord? Link to Discord in comments

I'd like to get at least 8 people so we might have to wait a bit in the discord for people to join. I can host the game and tell everyone on voice chat the code. Standard rules: just mute your mic when dead or in play. 

Oh I'm on mobile btw so that might cause some problems

:)
