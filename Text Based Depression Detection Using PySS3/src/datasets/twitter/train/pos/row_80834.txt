I fully support trans rights and everything but honestly for me Even with the benefits of online having tools like editing, lighting, angles etc. they are still not convincing. Everyone lies to make them feel better. Transwomen with their mutilated neo-vaginas that are essentially an open flesh wound that stinks and transmen with their Frankenstein bratwurst will never be convincing in the slightest.

I wish every trans person to find someone who will love them for who they are
