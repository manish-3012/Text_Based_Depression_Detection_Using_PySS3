Have you ever puked from swallowing a pill? ...or from trying to swallow a pill? It happened today with me and it was pretty traumatizing, adding to the list of such pill swallowing episodes. I dont dysphagia but I did once half-choke on a pill when I was younger and I believe all this stems from that fateful incident.

The damn pill I was trying to swallow was medium-sized but it kept swimming around and ricochetting off the walls of my throat like it was a water park or something, so I spit that piece of crap out and everything in my stomach decided to accompany it down the drain. And when your body decides to do that, you dont really get to have a say you know and so I did what I did. And now I am here vituperating that cursed little fagg\*t piece of cowsh\*t.

It baffles me how some people just casually swallow medications and pills the size of a f\*cking toenail. Is it possible to learn this power? Like does this happen to anyone else and is it even borderline relatable or am I the only damned human soul that has to face such a batshit problem? Do you have any suggestions? Any advice for my future encounters is welcome as I recover from PTSD.

Thanks for devoting a minute of your day to my musings.
