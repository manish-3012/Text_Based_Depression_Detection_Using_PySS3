Iâ€™m getting surgery on Monday. For background, I tore my ACL about three weeks back playing freshman soccer. I have to get reconstruct surgery if I ever want to play again. It is very strange since I have started to walk again but I still need surgery. It feels like I am going backwards. Just as I got off the crutches Iâ€™m going to be put right back on them. The thing that is the most stressful thinking about it is having to make up days of work( Iâ€™m in all honors). I just hope that it wonâ€™t actually take the estimated eight months to play again.
