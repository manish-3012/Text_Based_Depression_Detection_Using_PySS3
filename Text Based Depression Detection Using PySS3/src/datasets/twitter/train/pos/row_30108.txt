i have the sudden urge of wanting to make irl friends i have some but we rarely even talk, idk since it's at home studying i can't really do anything. my plan for this school year was to attend and join events, clubs, contests, camping and talk to alot of people as much as possible yk but covid happened, fuck covid.
