what have i gotten myself into i accidentally gotten myself into an ldr. i like her but i donâ€™t think i can do this. especially being my first relationship, i want it to be physical. she says she really likes me and doesnâ€™t want me to break her heart. i donâ€™t want that either and thatâ€™s what iâ€™m worried about. i donâ€™t want to break her heart but what if i eventually donâ€™t want this anymore. ik she eventually said she might be able to see me irl but thatâ€™s a while from now and how am i gonna be sure itâ€™s even gonna happen. i just am unsure what to do rn.
