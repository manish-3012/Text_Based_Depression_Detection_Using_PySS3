Unpopular Opinion (kinda): I have an uncontrollable hatred for naturally successful people. I know I should be happy for them but... why them? Especially when theyâ€™re assholes. I try so hard to be nice and do stuff well but I just constantly suck. Iâ€™m honestly numb to rejection at this point itâ€™s happened so much. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m saying this cus I know itâ€™s bad but maybe thereâ€™s some logic behind it? Iâ€™ve always been someone to overthink things and this is certainly something I overthink a lot. Luck is just not on my side and I hate that the dick munchers of the world are the ones getting lucky.
