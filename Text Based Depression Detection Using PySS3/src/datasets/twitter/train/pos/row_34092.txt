Remember that getting a partner isnâ€™t the point of life Itâ€™s really awesome to think about being with a special someone and comforting each other, but remember thatâ€™s not the most important thing in the world. ESPECIALLY donâ€™t get a girlfriend/boyfriend just for the sake of getting one. Youâ€™re most likely not gonna be happy in the long run if you donâ€™t know anything about your partner. If thereâ€™s someone who you enjoy talking to, makes you laugh, and youâ€™re genuinely interested in a relationship with them, go at it! This is just a reminder for those of you who are also still looking for the one, donâ€™t get carried away in the thought of being in a relationship.
