Imagine this happening to you Imagine that you work on a project for 40+ hours, competing for 500 dollars. Imagine that you submit this project and the host doesn't publish it in the contest. Oh wait, that is exactly what instructable did to me. I submitted my project multiple times to make sure it was in and, look at that, it didn't get entered. I'm beyond angry. This is flat out stupid.
