Is there something wrong with me? I just got the news of an old friend passing last night and I feel nothing, ofc it socks he died but Iâ€™m not crying, I didnâ€™t feel anything when I got the news and I havenâ€™t felt anything after thinking about it.

when I first moved to my town he used to be at my bus stop and we played â€œkick the rockâ€ together. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a well know thing but we would just try to kick a rock in between our legs on the sidewalk like soccer. But I digress, he also joined my wrestling team last year and we re became friends again.

I generally have a problem expressing emotions but I thought that when the time came and it was someone I knew I would cry, and here we are tearless and emotionless. Sometimes I feel like I just canâ€™t express emotion anymore. Rest in piece friend, really wish I could feel more for you.
