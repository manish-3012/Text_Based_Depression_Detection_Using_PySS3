Sexuality Rant Istg, this isn't good for me, myself, or my mental health.

So like, how the FUCK does sexuality work. I'm so confused rn because I feel like I don't fit in the categories I call myself.

So like, I call myself a lesbian because technically I only have an interest in women. I want to fuck girls but that's it. Only touch. No date. I don't get crushes or anything. I simply like going down town.

But then I'm technically bi because I do like dudes. I get crushes on guys, I like to look. But dating feels disgusting and I'm not interested in having sex with dudes. I'm not really a huge fan of penetration in general, it's just a turn off and annoying. Dick really isn't all that special. I've had sex with both sides so I can safely say I'm only interested in pussy.

So I like to only look at guys, and I only like to touch girls. I can't fucking STAND dating. Lovey dovey couple shit is disgusting. I feel horrible when it comes to being in a relationship. The experience doesn't even have to be romantic. Just knowing that I'm in a relationship with someone makes me feel repulsed. It's fucking filthy and feels wrong on so many levels. I feel paranoid constantly and being asked "Are y'all dating" is just so anNOYING.

So like, wtf me? My friend was like, "Oh you're probably Aromantic," and everyone tells me that. But nO. I'm not Aromantic. I like the idea of romance. I crave having a wife and drinking hot cocoa while we watch movies and cook dinner together in our Loft with the cat. But like actually doing that kind of stuff nauseates me to the core. I just cannot do it at all. It's vEry confusing and saying "Oh I'm Aromantic." doesn't feel right at all. I want a relationship and love. It's just... so gross...

So what the fuck am I??? I'm just *pIssEd* at myself rn because sexuality is so fucking confusing. Am I a lesbian that appreciates men? Am I bi that only can handle women? Like whAt the fuck me???
