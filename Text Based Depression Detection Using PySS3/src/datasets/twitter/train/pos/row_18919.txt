Should I lie to my parents about where Iâ€™m going to be tomorrow night? If you think Iâ€™m going to a party to have sex and I wanna lie to my parents, Iâ€™m sorry to disappoint you. This post isnâ€™t nearly as exciting. Alright, so here I go. Essentially whatâ€™s going is Iâ€™m a part of my schools marching band. And, Iâ€™ve been banned from preforming for the next two weeks cause Iâ€™m ineligible. If you guys donâ€™t know what that means, basically, if youâ€™re failing more than two classes, it makes you ineligible. Iâ€™m failing four classes. Now, my parents donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve been keeping this secret for about a week. My parents are really strict about grades, and if they found out, they would FREAK. My parents are good people, and I know they care about me, but I also know they would probably ground me for a month (not that I go anywhere anyways) and take away my phone and laptop for the next couple weeks. I could lie to them. Very easily. I have my own car, I could just go to the library and work on homework or something, and then watch the last couple minutes of the game so I would know who won. However, Iâ€™m really conflicted. I love my parents, and Iâ€™ve never really liked about anything major before. I donâ€™t want to lie. I donâ€™t, I really donâ€™t, but I donâ€™t know what to do! Iâ€™m really conflicted about this. Any advice would be welcome, but I need to make up a decision my tomorrow afternoon. Iâ€™m running out of time. Please help.
