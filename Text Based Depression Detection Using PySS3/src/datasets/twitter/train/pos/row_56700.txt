I'm not that scared of death because I've already expirienced it and so have you When I say death I don't mean the act of dying, I mean the state of being dead, or better described, the state of not existing.

Think back on your memories, keep going further into your past. The future you go, the more faded and murky your memories seem until eventually they just stop. You get to the point before you were born. That is what being dead feels like.

It's not dark, lonely, sad, or anything negative. It's just nothing, and I'm fine with that. 

Trying to imagine being dead is like trying to see what's in the back of your head/outside your peripheral vision.

Idk, I've wrestled with the idea of death alot and I've gotten to a point where it doesn't bother me
