I don't know what to do anymore I broke up with my gf about a month ago, but she wanted to be friends with benefits, so I agreed. I always tell her I love her, but she never says it back anymore. I asked her about it, and all she said was sorry. And that's all she ever says. I have now figured that she only wanted to be friends with benefits for the pleasure of it. I send her pics but she never send me any.
I now i should get rid of her, but I'm too soft on the inside to completely shut out someone from my life, but it keeps hurting me on the inside. Even if I did leave I would have no reason to have a phone. She's the only person I talk to. She's all I have left anymore. And it would kill me if I left.
I can't do anything, and need help.
