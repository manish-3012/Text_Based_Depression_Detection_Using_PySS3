Self-depreciation post cuz why not Yeah, I hate myself. I say to myself that Iâ€™m trying my best but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™ve never done that even once in my life. Iâ€™m always hoping someone would be my saviour and come save me and I am always stuck in my fantasies. Iâ€™m always thinking how I could solve all of my problems but Iâ€™m too lazy to ever act. I feel like crying and I do but it all feels fake because Iâ€™ve never really experienced anything bad in my life. I lost all of my friends and never really interact with my family because Iâ€™m stuck in my dreams and try to stay away from real life so much. I feel like trash because I literally have everything anyone could ever ask for in their life, Iâ€™m always thinking like Iâ€™m faking sadness. Iâ€™m just trying to validate myself by posting this on reddit hoping someone cares or something instead of dealing with my issues in real life. If I actually told someone about myself I could get help, but Iâ€™m always lying to everyone and lying to myself too. Edgy would be the best word to describe me. Iâ€™ve literally no redeeming qualities and am an entitled brat who wants to go out the easy way, but I donâ€™t even have the quality of courage to do that. The only quality Iâ€™ve got is seeking attention which I try to do to stay relevant to other people and I fucking hate that about myself.
