just me being depressed that moment when you hit that part of your life where you feel lonely even when you have friends, and feel unproductive and cant do shit no matter how much your friends support you. knowing the only thing that can help you is a partner in your life where they could love you in another level where you can feel safe and loved and someone whose support means more from them than anyone else

yeah idk what flair this will go to but im just tired and feel like shit
