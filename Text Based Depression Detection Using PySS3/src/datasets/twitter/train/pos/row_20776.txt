Hereâ€™s an interesting story One time at the beach I lost forgot my phone in the car. My little nieces got it for me but they were nosey and knew my password. They went to my photos and found porn. Hereâ€™s another interesting part, I donâ€™t remember downloading photos of porn. I tried my very hardest to remember, but didnâ€™t. So I had a very interesting talk with my family. I feel bad for my nieces, theyâ€™re both in elementary school.

*before yâ€™all say anything, I am not lying about not remembering. The photo was downloaded the same day my nieces got it for me. Idk how it got there but it did*
