Nighttime &gt;daytime, can't change my mind It's just a fact. The sky is soooo fucking beautiful at night, i could spend hours stargazing, the moon looks so good. Also it's much more quiet and you can relax. There is literally nothing better than a late night walk. Sleeping fucking sucks ass because i can't have fun when it's nighttime since I have to wake up for fucking school.
