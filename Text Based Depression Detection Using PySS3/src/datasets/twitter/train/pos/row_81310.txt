hehe, im going insane im tired of changing moods twice a day

i dont even understand half of my moods anyway,

its much more complicated then "sad" or "happy" 

like currently; im so confused, sad, scared, angry and happy at the same time

you probably wont believe that but i dont expect you to believe me anyways, sometimes even i cant believe myself

if this doesnt stop, im afraid im actually going to lose my mind
