Thank you, r/Teenagers Before I discovered this sub, my life was a mess. I lost my job due to covid, my anxiety was getting the better of me every day! My long term partner left me and I was considering suicide almost every day :(. This sub has finally given me enough reason to follow through with it! I cannot explain how thankful I am for this!
