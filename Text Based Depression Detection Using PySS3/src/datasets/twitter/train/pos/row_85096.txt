Xbox car game yuh If forza horizon 5 isnt any good its probably gonna kill the series which is really sad for me and a bunch of people because like, i love the forza series ive been playing since 2012 and have sunk 1000hours into forza horizon 3 and it will be sad if fh5 just flops and then the series is just dead         
 
Im tired as btw
