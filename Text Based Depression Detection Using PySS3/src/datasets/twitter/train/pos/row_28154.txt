I just had one of the best nights of my life. Me and the bois went to a haunted trail for spooktober after being separated by COVID for 7 months. Okay, what we did first was go to house of pizza to eat and talk before the trail. It was your basic haunted trail for the most part, so here's the bloopers of the night. 
1. Two girls came up to the 10 year old of the group (F.Y.I we were all 14 and 15 besides him) And he refuses to go with them and calls them gay. 
2. When the 10 year old tried to climb a tree one of my friends says "GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE" in a way that made us stereotype him as an alcoholic dad.
3. When we're on the trail we are running from a guy with a chainsaw and one of my friends goes "wait wheres Landon?!" And we're all wondering where he is and then we hear screaming down the trail and he comes RUNNING with the chainsaw dude right behind him so we absolutely bolt from him. 
4. While we are running I lose my phone and luckily find it (otherwise I couldn't make this post)
5. One of my friends tries to ask one the actors out but turns out they were gay.
Other than that it was a very fun night. Have a nice day.
