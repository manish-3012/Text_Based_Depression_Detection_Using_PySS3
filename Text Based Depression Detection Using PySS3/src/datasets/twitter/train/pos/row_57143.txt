When youre trying to swim backstroke but your brain wants to have the Hercules Mulligan rap in the Battle of Yorktown on repeat **â€ Hercules Mulligan
A tailor spyin' on the British government
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it (up)
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up againâ€œ** 

And then i got a best lmao
