Big day tomorrow, what do I do? Tomorrow is the first day since like early smarch that I have the entire house to myself for pretty much the whole day. Parents bringing sister to college then staying for a little while, and Iâ€™m going to be home by myself for the entire day. I donâ€™t know what to do with this time, but I definitely donâ€™t want to waste it

Any ideas (besides the obvious one) for me to do during the day that I normally wouldnâ€™t be able to do with people around?
