I have a crazy ex ðŸ˜ So like I dated this one person over two years ago and the relationship that happened was extremely toxic, they dated this one person a while ago and while they were dating I almost got in a fight with my exâ€™s significant other because my ex claimed "I was still in love with them" (btw I got over them like 3 months after we broke up), till this day my ex still flirts with me and they almost went as far as showing up to my house even though they know my parents hate them, recently they just made a fake account of me on Instagram, the questions I have are what should I do? How should I react to this? And what do you guys think? 
(Theyâ€™ve done more things but those are what I can think of off the top of my head)
