Fuck. Group. Work. Yes. I said it. Theres always this â€˜popularâ€™ kids group that flare up in excitement when it is announced, theres the â€˜averageâ€™ friend groups, then theres a loser group. A bunch of losers who donâ€™t have friends. Being in this group sucks. Itâ€™s almost like everyone is secretly laughing at you insider their hearts. Fuck group work.
