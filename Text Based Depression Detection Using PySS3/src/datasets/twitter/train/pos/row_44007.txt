Some help with ''free'' games? I am no stranger to pirating, as i have done it with movies many times.

I have never pirated a game as i find it too complicated.

But 40 bucks for EFT? Imma take my chances.

But as said earlier its too complicated. Im just wondering if anyone knows any easy to use sites, with as little manual work as possible?
