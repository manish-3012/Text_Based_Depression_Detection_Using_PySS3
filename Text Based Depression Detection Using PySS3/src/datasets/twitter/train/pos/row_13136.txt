Picking a random song from my playlist and copy pasting my favorite verse but I'm not telling you the song's name: Day 2 â€œMake me a promise here tonight, that's like a tidal wave
Dreamers and early graves, I never wanted to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home my girl
This is it, when it's done, we can say that
When it's sudden death we fight backâ€
