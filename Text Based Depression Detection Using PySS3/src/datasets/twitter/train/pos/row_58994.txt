You have the ability to be attractive. To be attractive you need to do 3 things. 


1: Hygiene. Take a shower, clean your hair, wash your face, put on deodorant, brush your teeth, floss. Itâ€™s just so so simple but it really does make a difference 


2: Stay Active. Workout, go for walks, etc. This is honestly the hardest step but itâ€™s such a big deal.


These 2 things directly effect the 3rd one


3: Confidence. Your personality, your mental state. If your not able to take care of yourself and love yourself, youâ€™ll never be attractive. And if your not interesting and enticing as a person, youâ€™ll definitely not me attractive. Pick up a hobby, find a passion. This step is whatâ€™s gonna make the most difference. 


Thereâ€™s no such thing as ugly, only un healthy.
