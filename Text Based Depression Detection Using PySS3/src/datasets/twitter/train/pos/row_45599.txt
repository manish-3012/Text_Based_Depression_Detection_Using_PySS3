Being 18 sucks TL;DR: Im 18 and I get creepy dms from men who are in there mid 20s, almost 30s, asking me out and want to bang me. I know that Iâ€™m legal but that doesnâ€™t mean I want to go out with them. 
 
Im 18 and I sell stuffs on Facebook marketplace to get a side income. Occasionally, I would get creepy dms from men who are in their mid 20s, almost 30 asking me out on a date. I explained to them that Iâ€™m 18, I have a bf and I still go to school, but they keep saying things like: "ohh but uâ€™re legal, plus ur bf sucks. I have a lot of Bitcoin. We could have so much fun together ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ let me take you to places before you do to college" I am traumatized from reading messages like this. 

Im pretty sure that one of them knows where I live so I just bought pepper spray :// lesson learned: if u want to sell smt online, do not meet somewhere close to home. 

P/S i accidentally got pepper spray on my hand and now itâ€™s burning :(
