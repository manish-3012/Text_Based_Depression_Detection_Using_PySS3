Well, tomorrow is my first day of high school. I know nobody that's going to the school im going into, because its a special program for smart people, so none of my past peers are going to the school I am. Which, I honesty enjoy, because I didn't have very many friends at my old school.

Anyways, any tips/tricks I should know before I start high school?
