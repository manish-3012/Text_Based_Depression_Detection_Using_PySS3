Everybody, Please Be Safe On the Internet Usually Reddit is an amazing place to meet new people, but please please please be careful. I just had someone try to get me to send him some very inappropriate things on this platform and I just finished reporting him to the police. 

Everybody, they prey on us because they know we are insecure and vulnerable. If someone starts asking or talking about inappropriate things and you are a minor, collect as much information as you can, donâ€™t send them anything, and report them to the police. They may be preying on other kids. Donâ€™t let them get away with it. 

If you want to report them without your parents finding out, google WeTip. Itâ€™s a way to make an anonymous police report. You never give them your name, and they will not contact you further. Also, if you report someone and they end up being arrested, apparently you get a reward. 

Please, if you see something, do something. I never want to relive that experience and I donâ€™t want anyone to ever fall victim to anyone like that again. 

Please be careful.
