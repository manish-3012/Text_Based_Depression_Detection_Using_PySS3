Dissecting my video I looked at my video called [physics for gamers ](https://youtu.be/ykhWQxCy8hI) i always knew it was off topic and barely holds on a topic but today i did it

I did the math and smoked the meth

The video is 

0:00 =&gt; 2:00 intro

2:00 =&gt; 6:30 the beef where i talk about education and physics 

6:30 =&gt; 8:00 literally just filming fire for no reason

8:00 =&gt; 9:46 outro

So 4 mins intro and outro

1:30 mins random stuff 

5:30 is nothing and the rest is the actual video 

4:15 the real video 

I think this is why i like this video 

I just made a video for fun

No certain topic i just made the video with me slightly touching on a topic

If i hadn't touched on that topic and just released the 5:30 parts i wouldn't have known what to name the video lol but now that i have talked about physics for a llittle i know what to title it 

I really like the video i love it

One of my favourite videos i made

Best part is tbe outro i love itt
