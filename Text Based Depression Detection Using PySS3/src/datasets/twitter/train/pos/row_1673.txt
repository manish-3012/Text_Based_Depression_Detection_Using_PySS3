I freaking did it!!! My mother told us a couple weeks ago that we werenâ€™t celebrating Halloween. My spook vibes did not resonate with that. Her reason was that we were Christians and that we shouldnâ€™t celebrate the holiday. Weâ€™ve been Christians for years now and this sudden change didnâ€™t really make any sense. We bickered and finally she said we could celebrate but she wasnâ€™t buying anything. So your boy went ahead and bought his 5 siblings their costumes along with one for himself. I also bought a large amount of candy so I can hide it around the house for the little gremlins to find. Then weâ€™re gonna watch Halloween movies until we crash. Itâ€™s a safe, fun, and non satanic Halloween and I planned it all on my own. I hope everyone has the spookiest of times. Stay safe and brush your teeth.
