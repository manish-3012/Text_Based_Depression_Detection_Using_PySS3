I can't tell if I'm really smart or if everyone I know is extremely stupid. Over the past few days I have had to be "Mr. dictionary" because apparently no one know what nonsensical means. Like I have to spend more time explaining my vocabulary then speaking. I DON'T EVEN SAY UNNECESSARILY LONG WORDS! I just speak. On top of that people are saying that I'm "deep" for saying shit like (oversimplified versions, minus reasoning) "music is cool bc it's the human brain recognising various sounds as something more than just sound" and "you remember everything but you just can't recall it". Like.. how dumb is everyone, just observe and analyze it. It's not Einstein shit.
