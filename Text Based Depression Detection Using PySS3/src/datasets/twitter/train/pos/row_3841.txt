My thoughts on this subreddit "war" (Rant)

I'm not gonna keep talking about how sexist this subreddit is to either gender because honestly I don't want to, why should I just talk about something that ANY follower of this subreddit knows.

When people make an "attempt" to stop sexism it always ends with them insulting another gender. It's just clashing back and forth and it sucks. Honestly all of us are teens and that is why we are here to talk with other stangers in our age group and have a free space to share. That's what reddit is, or what it used to be.
