Hi some questions about how to have safe sex (Posting this here because I think I may have been banned from r/LGBTeens. Whenever I post, it gets automatically deleted with no explanation.) 

I canâ€™t imagine myself having sex any time in the near future but I would like to keep some knowledge about how to not get an std in mind. 

Iâ€™m a lesbian so Iâ€™m not worried about getting pregnant, so do I have to worry about â€œsafe sexâ€? I know there are stds but how do those work? 

If two girls are both completely virgins and have sex, is there any chance of them spreading an std to the other person? 

Can you get tested for stds? I know that straight couples that want to have kids donâ€™t use a condom, so there must be a way to know if your partner has an std, right? 

I really appreciate any feedback or links to sources.
