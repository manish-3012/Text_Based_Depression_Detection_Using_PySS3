Hello fellow teenagers, help me and my friends decide what movie to watch (options below) 1) Sherlock Holmes (part 2)
2) Murder on the Orient express
3) Journey 2 the mysterious island
4) The Darkest hour

If you have any better suggestions within the genre of these movies or comedy you can leave them in the comments

Thankyou!
