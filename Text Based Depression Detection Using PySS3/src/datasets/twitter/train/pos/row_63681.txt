I have made a huge mistake I came to a birthday party because it's the party of a good friend, but there are a lot of people that I don't know. The main problem is that I'm EXTREMELY introverted. I can't even hold a conversation. I came for the cake, and because I was told there were gonna be board games (I love boardgames). Now everyone is kind of drunk and I'm stuck here. I don't have a way to get home on my own. Instead of being uncomfortable next to everyone, I'm just browsing reddit alone. I know everyone probably thinks I'm weird but at this point I'm just tired and want to go home. I've been here too many hours. I made this post just to vent because as much as I love my friends, this is just not fun for me. The worst part is that we didn't even play board games.

Sorry if this post isnt comprehensible, I just want home, where a good pizza is waiting for me.
