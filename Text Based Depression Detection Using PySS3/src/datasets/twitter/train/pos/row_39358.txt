I'm hopefully, going to be a teacher hello there,

\*Ah, General Kenobi\*

sorry for that.... I'm kind of a nerd...... anyway,

I'm currently studying A-level chemistry and BTEC lv3 engineering at college, and I have applied for an education/teaching course at some universities. If I get in to one and pass the course then I shall be a teacher, probably in the UK, and I was curious as to any changes that you wish your teachers had made to their lessons that I can take with me, and use to my advantage if and when I get to be one....

ok thanks alot, and have a nice day ðŸ˜Š
