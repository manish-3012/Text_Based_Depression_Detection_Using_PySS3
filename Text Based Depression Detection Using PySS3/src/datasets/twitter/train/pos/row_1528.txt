kinda scared that my mouth breathing habit has changed how I look Ever since I was small I slept with my mouth open. I got braces and they completely fixed my teeth after I got them removed. Iâ€™m happy with my smile and I feel like they kinda changed the shape of my jaw in a good way. The thing is that I still sleep with my mouth open even though I donâ€™t have breathing problems. Itâ€™s only at night and breathing with my mouth open makes me feel less claustrophobic and it feels better. The orthodontist had told me when I first got braces that my mouth shrunk because I slept with my mouth open. Every time I mention this to people they think itâ€™s stupid but youâ€™d think a doctor knows what theyâ€™re talking about. They said that the reason my teeth got messed up in the first place is because my tongue wasnâ€™t resting against the top of my mouth when I slept. 

Iâ€™m seriously considering sleeping with a sleep tape on my mouth now just so maybe my face might look better. Iâ€™ve always thought the way my face looks is kind of odd but it seems like a lot of people donâ€™t really have a clear idea of how they look. At this point I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m attractive or unattractive but Iâ€™m willing to sleep with my mouth closed if thatâ€™ll do anything tbh. The idea that maybe the reason I look weird is all because I sleep with my mouth open is kinda scary and hopefully itâ€™s not too late to try to fix this. This is basically the reason I got braces in the first place.

I can still see my jawline and I canâ€™t see my gums when I smile. Overall, I donâ€™t see too much of the problems that come along with sleeping with your mouth open but maybe thatâ€™s because I got braces at an early age. This ended up being really long and I donâ€™t think anyone would read all this oh well
