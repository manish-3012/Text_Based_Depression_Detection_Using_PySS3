I know you probably don't care, but my dad said he was proud of me I've lived for 15 long years on this god forsaken earth, and not once has anybody said they were proud of me.
Yesterday my dad said he was proud of me, because  my grades didn't slip, despite going through shit (being hospitalised multiple times, diagnosed with multiple disorders, severe depression, going on hard meds, having the majority of my friends ditch me, a few considered murdering me) on top of online school.
I just wanted to share that someone was proud of me for once
