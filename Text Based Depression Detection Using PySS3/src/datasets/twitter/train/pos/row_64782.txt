Please donâ€™t do it Hi, around a year ago I saw a post on a different sub, saying that they were going to commit suicide in a week. The man was around 30, gay and hiv positive. A week later I open reddit, and see a comment reply. Itâ€™s to the post. The post is â€œI am going to commit suicide in a weekâ€ from u/deleted. I fucking cried. In public, with my best friend. I fucking cried for 10 minutes straight. Iâ€™ve never met this person in my entire life, I never knew anything about them. I just want you to know, if you are considering taking your own life. Please. Please donâ€™t, you matter. Every little thing you do makes a difference. This memory, of this man Iâ€™ve never met, taking his own life, fucking changed me more than you could ever imagine. Every time the thought of suicide pops into my head, I remember his post. You matter to people you donâ€™t even know. I love you, I love you, I love you. Goodnight, sleep well. And have a great school year.
