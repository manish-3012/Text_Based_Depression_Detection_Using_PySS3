Ah itâ€™s time for some whiny shit no one cares to read So Iâ€™m in college rn and I went my entire life without a real relationship and now I donâ€™t even know how that stuff works. I feel empty without someone in my life which makes no sense considering Iâ€™ve never had that. Iâ€™ve kissed one person in my life and it was on a dare. Wtf is happening that is causing me to post about this. I canâ€™t even meet people here because idk how to if yk what Iâ€™m sayin
