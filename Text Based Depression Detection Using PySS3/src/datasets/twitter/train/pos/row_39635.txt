So my job is mandating masks on the 24th For everybody, even night workers(me) 

Now, I have no problem with this but the thing that annoys me is that as far as i knew the company considered the pandemic over back in June when they took away our hazard pay and let go the majority of the extra staff they hired throughout the company.

I just think that if they now want to enforce masks they should be paying the hazard pay again because clearly the pandemic isnâ€™t over.

But i doubt thatâ€™ll happen because the company has a bad reputation and the owners are greedy as fuck
