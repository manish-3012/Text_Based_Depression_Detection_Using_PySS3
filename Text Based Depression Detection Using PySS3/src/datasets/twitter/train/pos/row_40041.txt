Today is my last day being a teenager and I'm teaching classes today. I'm turning 20 tomorrow and in my 3rd Year of College studying to be a science and maths teacher. I have three classes every Tuesday as part of my college placement and there is something very strange about teaching a bunch of teenagers on my last day of being a teenager.
