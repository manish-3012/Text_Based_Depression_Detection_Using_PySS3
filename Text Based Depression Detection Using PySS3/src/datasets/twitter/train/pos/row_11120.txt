Yet another post about how proud I am of my boyfriend. In the last few days, his band has gotten 1.6k monthly listeners. Thatâ€™s a huge achievement, considering theyâ€™re a brand new band and everything. My boyfriend has been so hard working, he put so much effort into the music video and cover arts, it just makes me the proudest girlfriend ever because of how talented and tenacious he is. 

He also met my extended family yesterday (uncles, cousins, ect). My uncle instantly approved of him and told my mother that I picked extremely well. 

Weâ€™ve been together over 6 months now already and spent 70% of lockdown together and I think that not only are we lovers, but we are best friends. Iâ€™ll always feel like the luckiest girl alive with him by my side. He is the best thing in my life and Iâ€™ll always support him and no matter what he does, Iâ€™ll still be the proudest!

(Btw if you wanted to check out his band, itâ€™s called Rats On Acid, here are the respective YouTube and Spotify links:
