Alright people. Listen up. I've never been one to be political, but I feel like I just have to get this off of my chest.

BLM stands for Black Lives Matter, but really advocates that *all* lives matter. This a legitimate organization that enjoys protesting peacefully to get their point across. However, some of their protests turn into riots. It's not their fault though.

ANTIFA stands for Anti-Fascist. However their actions really prove that *they* are fascists. They are the ones who turn protests into riots. They steal, they hurt, and their ideals aren't good ones either.

They say they want socialism, which means that everyone benefits, but like all others who have attempted socialism in the past, the real agenda is Communism, in which everyone is equally poor. 

They also want to get rid of religion entirely. They've been tearing down statues of Jesus and Mary, and it won't stop there. Soon enough, if they haven't already, they'll start to tear down statues of Buddah, Gahndi, etc. As a Christian, I don't agree with any of this. The freedom of religion is what founded this country, and now ANTIFA is trying to take away this and other freedoms. 

I know we aren't old enough to vote yet, but we are the future of America. When we turn 18, it'll be our responsibility to make sure whoever is in a seat of political power has Amerca's best interests at heart.

I'm a Republican, but not a Trump supporter. The only good thing he's done throughout all of the Covid-19 pandemic is that special ops team to combat Epstein's child pornography ring.

I end with this: I can't tell you what's right and what's wrong, but I can give you facts. These are the facts that I know of, so I'm just gonna give them to you like they are. 

To all: if you're black, or Hispanic, or LGBTQ, or whatever, I hope you have an incredible, safe day. God bless you all!
