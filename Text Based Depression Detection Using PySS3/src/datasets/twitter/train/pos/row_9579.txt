The story on how i took revenge on my friend So it was a normal day, my friend had a crush on this girl and he asked her out. She said no, which is completely ok but, she started making fun of him for being a "simp" and as the 8th graders we are, we all started making fun of him and making memes of him (yes) until the point he considered suicide. Little did he know, that i wasnt making fun of him. He is my best friend and im not a toxic brat. Ever since she started making fun of him in the most minimum way, I had a plan. I was going to break her heart. So this is when my 8 months plan started. I seduced her making her think I liked her by also "making fun of him" and stuff and when I asked her out, she said yes (gottem). Fast forward 8 months until now, I decided it was time to end the plan by telling her that this was all false and that she got played. Now, I might sound like an asshole but keep in mind she almost made my best friend commit suicide. Nobody, not even my friend, knew about my plan. She got left completely heartbroken and I took revenge for my friend.
