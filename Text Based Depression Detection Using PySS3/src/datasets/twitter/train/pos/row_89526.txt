Just another vent if your going to be rude just scroll to the next post I (16) male started talking to a girl (17) so my grandma runs a group home for foster teens who nobody wants (Iâ€™m also in foster care) but I met this girl I will call her J me and J talked every night for hours and weâ€™re super food friends I started really liking her but never brought it up because Iâ€™m close with lots of the other girls there two to the point we say weâ€™re cousins so I didnâ€™t know if she would find it weird but i was into four about seven months I was in a abusive relationship fof three years during this I also knew she was already super depressed so I didnâ€™t want to bring my doom and gloom into her life I was considering telling her I liked her but she got 5150 for people who donâ€™t live in California itâ€™s a three day stay in the hospital where  people try to see your mental state and if your safe on your own she was in and out of institutions because of suicide attempts and she also did pills a lot but she got 5150 because she tried to kill herself since then I feel itâ€™s my fault and Iâ€™m not good enough because I couldnâ€™t even make her enjoy life enough to want to live my grandma decided she was donâ€™t with her and now she lives four hundred miles away and I want to talk to her but when I see her posts or think about her I just feel  sad
