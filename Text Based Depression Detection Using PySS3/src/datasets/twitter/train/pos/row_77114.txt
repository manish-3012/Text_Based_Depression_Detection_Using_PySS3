Am I just a bitchy teen? I'm having a lot of trouble with math and my mom yells at me about it, and it just makes me feel worse so I do worse. I'm also not the greatest at deciding on what I want quickly and it upsets my girlfriend. I really love her and I know she feels the same way, but I can tell it really annoys her, and I feel really bad about it. Everyone thinks I lie a lot to them but I really don't. I'm trying to get a license and job but everytime I ask my mom she's all like i don't want you working right now. I used to cut myself a lot but i quiet and it's really hard not to fall back on that.
