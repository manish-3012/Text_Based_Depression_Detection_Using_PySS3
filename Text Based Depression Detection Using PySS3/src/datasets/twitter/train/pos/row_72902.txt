Since no one here is truth about their dream memes, here is a detailed version I made, while I have 200 missing assignments. I spawn in the corner of a old ww2 hangar, my grandma is sitting on a table, with my grandpa and father, standing up on a chair, there is a staircase where it leads to my romanian house, my sister walks in with a pentium 4 and says she wants to build a pc, I randomly get a generic keyboard and hold it, my dad turns angry and starts shouting about computers, then I awake.
