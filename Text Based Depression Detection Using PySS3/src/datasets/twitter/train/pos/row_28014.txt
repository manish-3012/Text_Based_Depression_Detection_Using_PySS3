everything feels so bittersweet to me. moving schools again. iâ€™m kinda glad itâ€™s in person for some reason. i want friends. iâ€™ve started wearing makeup, dressing nicer, buying more expensive things... iâ€™ve oughtta find someone. at this same time though, iâ€™m so anxious. i hate this cycle i always get into where i get depressed, get stupid, get thrown into the other parentâ€™s house, move schools... why am i hopeful? i know itâ€™s my personality holding me back. iâ€™m boring. no matter how many times i move schools. iâ€™m alone. 

also been having suicidal thoughts tonight. i could end it. i donâ€™t need friends. i donâ€™t need a boy/girlfriend. i donâ€™t need anyone. i donâ€™t have to make myself anxious and make others disappointed. i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m saying. iâ€™m too stupid to think.
