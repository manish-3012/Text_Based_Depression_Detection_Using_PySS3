You are absolutely stunning today! I thought that it would be good for at least one person to tell you the truth today, so here I am. How was your day? How was your week? It is the end of the week after all. I'll start. My week was pretty good, albeit quite busy. Today was interesting too. I got this dilemma of how to define moral value, and whether one's own opinion of a beings moral value is all that should be taken into account when acting. That's all from me! Now it's your turn!
