Idk about reposts Iâ€™m starting to feel like reposts arenâ€™t such a bad thing in the long run. Yes, everyone hates it when you see the same meme once a day for a week, but seeing old posts from like a year or two ago can be kinda fun too. You get to laugh again as you remember how it made you laugh the first time. You do also get to realize that you still have the same crappy sense of humor you developed after a month on social media tho...
