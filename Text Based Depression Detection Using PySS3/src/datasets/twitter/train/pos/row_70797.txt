The rest of my family doesnâ€™t want to get the new COVID vaccine. I live in a household with my mother and father, they are both Christian and donâ€™t believe in vaccines (they still get them not to be complete buttholes). I was wondering what you guys would choose.

Would you A. Get the vaccine?

Or B. Not get the vaccine because (reason)?

Feel free to elaborate in the comments, I look forward to seeing your answers.
