Book suggestions!! I want to read some books on books. It would be best if those are novels and stuff - some contemporary stuff about the lives of teens and other stuff. I mean the books doesn't have to be specifically about the lives of teenagers, it can be teen-based. Like 13 reasons why is about suicide but it is teen-based.
