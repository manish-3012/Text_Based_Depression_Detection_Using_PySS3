I'm trying to start a business. Hi everyone I'm kinda tired of sitting on my ass all day so I want to start a business. Looking for a group of people who want to do the same. Honestly I don't know what business but probably something online. Or maybe just a way to make money with a few people. if that sounds like fun DM me. Thanks and have a good day.
