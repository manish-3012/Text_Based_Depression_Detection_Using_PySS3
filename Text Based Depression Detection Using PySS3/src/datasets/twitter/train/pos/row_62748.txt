A teacher at my school died. Hey everyone. 

I decided to talk about this because I need someone other than people I know to talk about this.

At 20:30pm (UK) on Sunday the 23rd of August, I received an email from my school. Apparently, a teacher called Mr. Bristow had died, and school was going to close tomorrow so we could all grieve. I was shocked, but only for a split second. Then, I saw that on a group chat that everyone was talking about it. Then, I sent the following message on the group chat. 


TRIGGER WARNING



I donâ€™t want to be an insensitive bitch about this, but I donâ€™t really care that someone died. Iâ€™ve never met the person. I realise his loss may be really hard on some people, and I feel for them. But we all will end up dying one day, heck, I might not even be alive tomorrow. So whatâ€™s the big deal? Weâ€™re all going to die. In 100 years time, people wonâ€™t even know who we are.

I sent this, knowing exactly what I said. Surprisingly, no one gave me any backlash about this. 


But then, I asked what the cause of the death was.

Mr. Bristow had died falling from a rock climbing accident and getting lost at sea. He was never found.

This fact alone made me realise how irrational I was being. I thought the teacher had died from old age, or something. But now knowing the real cause, I feel so terrible. I feel absolutely *awful*. I donâ€™t know what to think or do anymore. 

Itâ€™s funny isnâ€™t it? Before knowing the cause, I couldnâ€™t care less. But know knowing it, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll even be able to go to sleep. 

Iâ€™m not entirely sure where to end this, but I do have advice. 

Donâ€™t jump to conclusions and assume things.
