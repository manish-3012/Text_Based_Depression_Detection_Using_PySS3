Brimstone Brawlers - Releasing Free to play tomorrow on steam!  I hope this is okay posting, admins do your thing if not. It was suggested I post here.

Hey guys, just a quick one. My brother has been solo developing his game â€œBrimstone Brawlersâ€ over the last few years and is alpha releasing it tomorrow on steam. In a nut shell this is a smash brothers like top down fantasy brawler. The type of game you play with your friends to wind down and take a break from your usual competitive games.

Heâ€™s poured every free hour heâ€™s had into it and Iâ€™m just hoping to get it out there a bit more as he deserves it.

Brimstone Brawlers is an action packed arena beatâ€™em up, where players battle it out as peculiar characters dwelling in the fantasy industrial city of Brimstone. Smack projectiles out of the sky, combine chemicals to discombobulate your enemies and hurl sinister spells to melt their souls!
