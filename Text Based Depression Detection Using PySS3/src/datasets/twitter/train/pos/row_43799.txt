What do normal teens â€¢doâ€¢ with their lives? I just got out of a highly manipulative friendship where i had to text her every 3 seconds or a meltdown would occur so i would normally just be on my phone a l l t h e t i me. 

Anyway, since ive gotten out of that, ive had literally no idea what to do since i have n o hobbies or friends. And i cant drive. So, what do you people normally do?
