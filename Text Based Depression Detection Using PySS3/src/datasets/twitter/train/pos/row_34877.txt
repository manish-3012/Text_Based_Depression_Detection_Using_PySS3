I need new friends, ok, thanks! 19 year old dude here! Last few days of being a teen, so, thought Iâ€™d post here! 

COVID hasnâ€™t been kind, at all. I havenâ€™t met my friends in almost a year and itâ€™s starting to take a toll. Currently looking to make new friends from all over the world, gender doesnâ€™t matter!

I love cars, cats, cooking, F1, plants, photography and videography. I know, weird combo right? I also DJ from time to time! 



My time zone is GMT +4. 

Canâ€™t wait to hear from all of you!
