Shooting my shot I have today shot my shot with this girl who I have known for around 6 years now.  We have been ok friends but never really spoke until this past year where we would speak most fridays at the bus stop waiting to come home.

In the past couple of weeks we started speaking but it didn't last long, which hurt badly. I kept wondering if i had done something wrong. Luckily when I asked her about this she said that it was no ones fault.

However i still couldn't get her out of my head, so after years of have little confidence in my self I finally told her how i felt about her. Its been 6 hours and she hasn't seen it but ill update this post if she responds.

I thought I would share this so I don't bottle stuff up like I hve in the past and also to hopefully inspire others to shoot their shot.
