â€œdonâ€™t talk backâ€ is stupid Itâ€™s not stupid in every situation. If a kid is being a outright rude, then I understand. Unfortunately though, parents (shitty ones) that use the â€œdonâ€™t talk backâ€ card when theyâ€™re being a prick and want to get away with it are actively displaying crappy communication skills to their kids and itâ€™s completely counter productive.

My grandmother is a light sleeper and my father has a pattern of being inconsiderate to all other people if he feels like it sometimes. Itâ€™s definitely his main character flaw to say the least lmao. Anyways he was in the kitchen, slamming drawers and the microwave, and I asked him to try and be a little quieter so my nana doesnâ€™t wake up. This apparently was wrong? 

I was told that heâ€™s gonna â€œdo whatever he wantsâ€ (keep in mind he doesnâ€™t pay rent, utilities, or much else for that matter cause itâ€™s her house), and that Iâ€™m a bitch for â€œtalking backâ€ after this and defending myself, anddd that as â€œhis childâ€ I cannot â€œdisrespectâ€ him. 

In my eyes, heâ€™s the only one being disrespectful, to my grandmother and to me lmao. I donâ€™t get it. Why are some parents just on a power trip and want to use this card? Itâ€™s infuriating.
