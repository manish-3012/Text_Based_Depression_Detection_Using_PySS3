Man,fuck my parents So about a year ago I started playing ukulele and picked it up pretty quickly. I really liked it and was pretty good at it and then this year I decided I wanted to play at my school talent show. When I told my mum she said â€œno,youâ€™re shit compared to the other kidsâ€ now I know this doesnâ€™t sound to bad but I was already self conscious about my music already but this comment straight up made me give up. I was working on an album at the time as well. Then a few days after I was playing and realised that I had completely lost my skill then I had a mental breakdown and had to talk to my friend for a few hours to calm me down. Then me and parents were fighting when I decidedâ€fuck itâ€ and cut the string to my ukulele so now I canâ€™t play music,I canâ€™t sing,I canâ€™t even let my emotions out in music now.
So thanks Mum hope youâ€™re happy ðŸ¥°
