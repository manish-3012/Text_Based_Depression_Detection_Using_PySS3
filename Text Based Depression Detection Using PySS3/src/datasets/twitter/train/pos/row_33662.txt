I feel so fucking stupid. So I live in CA, USA. Yesterday, Friday, I had no school since it was... something about teachers working. The thing is that Friday was also the day where my algebra teacher was hosting a movie, which I totally forgot about. 

So then my stupid ass sends him this email:

Hello Mr. *[algebra teacher],*

Sorry I couldnâ€™t make it to the movie today.  My family and I went on a little road trip to Las Vegas as a way to relax. 

Please donâ€™t think I didnâ€™t want to assist to your movie. 

Sincerely, 
*[My name]*


This is not true by the way, and I donâ€™t think heâ€™s going to believe it. And Friday was where I set the world record of the most stupid excuse ever created. Now that I think about it at 3:11 AM, I shouldâ€™ve just said I forgot.
