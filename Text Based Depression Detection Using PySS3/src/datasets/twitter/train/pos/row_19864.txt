So I don't know if what this means So I was rollerblading yesterday with my crush/best friend. She was teaching me how because it was my first time. Her grandma was there helping me too. (mind you this is the same girl who downloaded and made an account for discord for no other reason than to talk to me on her phone.) Her grandma left because she said I got the hang of it. I clearly didn't and so my friend stayed behind to help me balance.  
    
She hooked my arm with here to help me stabilise and then all of a sudden she grabbed my hand and held it like a couple would walking down the street. She wouldn't let go and I wasn't expecting that. I didn't force it and I had no idea this would happen, all her. Well while that was happening I was looking at her and I hit a crack and fell I sprained my ankle.

 she texted me later and said that her grandma approved of me and that she said I was the funniest person she's met. Anyway I don't know I just thought it was a very good moment for me that my crush held my hand without me doing anything. That was my first time.
