My main method of processing things is talking it out (like the rubber ducky method), but I've now learned the flaw in that system I have 2 entities I rant to- my (sorta ex) boyfriend and my childhood friend group (which he is a part of). Now that my issue is about him I can't talk it out with him nor can I with the friend group or anyone in it because he has a right to his own privacy. And so nowww the internet gets stuck with my problems. 

It's a lot less productive when you're just writing out a wall of text with no interaction or questions or help in guiding you through it... but something is better than nothing ig
