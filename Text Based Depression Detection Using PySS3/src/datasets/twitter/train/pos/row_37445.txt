Whatâ€™s the most surreal dream youâ€™ve ever had? I donâ€™t have dreams often but last night I had one and it felt so unbelievably real and in a sense I felt a lot of emotion

All I remember is my brother on the floor dying. His eyes rolled back and it was like he was suffocating

Super scary and somehow I felt scared and sad while it was happening so who knows what I looked like while sleeping but yeah, canâ€™t describe it super well but it was awful

Anyway here comes the weird part, I then kill him with a [triangular protractor ](https://www.ubuy.com.bh/productimg/?image=aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFnZXMtbmEuc3NsLWltYWdlcy1hbWF6b24uY29tL2ltYWdlcy9JLzQxeEZ0VlNDR2tMLmpwZw.jpg), he had cuts over his body from that and so I carried him out his room, dead and all and then the dream ends

Weird but still very real, I woke up scared because it felt true

Anyway whatâ€™s the scariest/most surreal dream youâ€™ve ever had?
