I don't like the hair on my body, I'm thinking of burning them off with a lighter Men on both sides of my family have the genes to become fucking bears and looks like I'm going that way too. I've heard shaving body hair causes it to grow back faster and harder, that's why I'm asking, would a lighter work better?
