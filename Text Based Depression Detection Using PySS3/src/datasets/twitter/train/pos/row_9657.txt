15yo &amp; Depression Hey guys i'm not english so sorry for the misstakes
Anyway : 
I'm a 15yo boy who live in France. 
I has a tought 2 year &amp; was diagnoses with Sever depression / Phobia. 

I pass 2 weeks in Hospital 2 Month ago to see if i have some trouble with my treatment ( I take "Sertraline" if you want to know ) 

My mom in the beggining of my depression thought I was just Lazy ( I was always sleeping in class ect ) 
She put so much pression on me that I... just burn out 

That's when I found that I can't cry anymore or Feel anything. I just feel that my Heart is a black Hole &amp; All the feelings People give me just dissapear instantly. 

Beside all of that I quit school on January at first I was just sick, but a Day I just say to myself : 

" Why ? Why do I continue to suffer everyday and everyday. I just Hurt myself everytime i Wake up so what if.. I dont wake up anymore ? " 

That was my first suicidal thought &amp; I was Scared as hell I cry &amp; I cry because of what I just Did i think about my Mom &amp; my Familly... I didnt want to Loose them. 

So  I closed in on myself and my feelings with.

Then a social worker took care of us and that was the moment when I wanted to regain taste quickly I thought, "Me too! I too want to be able to have a good life ... a teenage life like any other teenager 

Thanks to her help, the help of Psychologists and especially the help of my treatment I succeeded in regaining a taste for life!

 As I said earlier I wanted to have a teenage life like any other and Today I am proud to say it with a Huge joy:

 I was Accepted in the high school of my dreams! One more step towards a rather normal life!
