So hear me out Blanket = warm

People are warm-blooded

Therefore people are blankets

Someone who is attractive is â€œhotâ€

Chads are â€œcoolâ€

A good blanket warms you up making you hot

A bad one makes you cold or cool

Therefore all humans are blankets and chad is just a bad blanket, and attractive people are functional blankets which is why we sleep with them
