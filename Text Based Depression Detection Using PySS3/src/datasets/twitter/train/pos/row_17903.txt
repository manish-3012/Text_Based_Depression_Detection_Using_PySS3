Read this real quick. First things first, I'mma say all the words inside of my head. I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been.

Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be. I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea.

I was broken from a young age, taking my sulking to the masses, writing my poems to the few that look to me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me. Singing from heartache, from the pain, taking my message from the veins, speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty from the pain.

You made me a believer.

You break me down, you build me up.

Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain. My life, my love, my drive it came from pain.

Those are real lyrics to a song you've probably heard on the radio, but I think people need to look at them without the catchy song, and tunes, because it is a really powerful message. Believer by Imagine Dragons.
