I saw my crush at the wrong moment ( please dont mind my bad English) Me and my brother were cleaning some dirt from the back of our house, I was wearing some  old and torn, completely useless garment as it was to get more dirty sometime later, my clothes got more dirty as we cleaned the whole mess, while we were about to end, my crush from school passed by our house, she is hygienic and she really likes people with fashion, we both saw each other, she saw me with those torn and dirty clothes I was wearing, even though we saw each other we pretended like we didn't, she quickly rushed away and went where she was going, I hope she doesn't think I am much more low class person and I am not right for her :(
