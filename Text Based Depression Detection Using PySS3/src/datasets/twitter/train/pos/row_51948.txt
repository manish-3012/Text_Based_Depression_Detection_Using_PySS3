So for a while now Iâ€™ve seen things about guys never getting compliments but Iâ€™ve had a very different experience. Recently I have been noticing memes about how guys never get compliments or conversations and things like that right well Iâ€™m having a different experience and itâ€™s not very fun for me: a friend of mine introduced me to a child hood friend of hers this year Iâ€™m sharing Avery goddamn class except math with her she keeps adding me to their google hangouts groups with more and more women involved which is freaking me out because Iâ€™m not really used to talking with women my age (13) but Iâ€™m in several of those and I get regular compliments from me step grandma and step mom because of how much I help them out and what not so if you want to go down my path avoid certain subjects and certain joke be a little more outgoing do more chores and be efficient and you might get a few compliments and a few friends I currently have to many friends and not enough to do with them
