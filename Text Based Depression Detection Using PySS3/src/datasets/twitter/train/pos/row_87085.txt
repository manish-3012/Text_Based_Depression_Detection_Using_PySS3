I need a advice from a guy So I'm a girl, and I have a friend who is a guy, we''re not very close but I have known him for a long time. We are in the same small friend group now. He's been acting a bit off lately, a little while ago he said he wasn't feeling good and I'm concerned he is not doing well mentally. - - I could be wrong but he's acting differently, more quiet. But as a girl I can look out for my girlfriends, but if it's a guy it's more difficult to comfort/help them. If your a guy what advice would you give? What would you appreciate a girl saying/doing that wouldn't make you feel uncomfortable?
