Holy shit I like my new school a lot better So at my old school everyone was super uptight Christian conservative type. (Iâ€™m also closeted bi btw)

Now here itâ€™s so much different, I know 3 or 4 people out as lgbt already and thereâ€™s no homophobes aside from the kids from my old school.

Ok and hereâ€™s the funny part, everyone was super uptight about any sexual shit last year but now my teacher said: â€œIâ€™ll let you retake the quiz if you fail, only tests you should worry about are HIV and Pregnancy tests

And everyone (that I saw, this is online school) started dying laughing
