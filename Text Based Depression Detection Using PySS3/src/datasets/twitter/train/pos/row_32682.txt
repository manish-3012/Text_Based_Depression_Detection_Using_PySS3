I swear some girls only follow back on Ig based off the amount of followers you have Iâ€™m a good looking guy and back when I had 800 followers on Instagram and followed a hot girl I would maybe get a request back like 50% of the time. Now tho with over 1000+ followers I get a follow back nearly all the time which leads me to believe girls just care about clout &amp; itâ€™s so sad
