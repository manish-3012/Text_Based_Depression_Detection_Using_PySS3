I have to confess something In the grade 6 exam that was super important, I brought the exam home and typed up the questions online, found some answers and put them in a piece of paper. 

Then went back to school saying I left a field trip paper in my desk as an excuse. 

Then I put the exam back in my desk without anybody noticing me. 

Years later when my brother was in grade 6 I asked him whatâ€™s the story Andre told me , so I  looked it up and showed him the answers and he took note of that . 

Im a bad man
