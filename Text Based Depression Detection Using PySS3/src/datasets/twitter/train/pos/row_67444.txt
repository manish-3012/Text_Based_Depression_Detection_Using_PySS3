Wait a minute didnâ€™t Veggie Tails have a series of religious episodes I swear when I went to Sunday school or something like that. Maybe I was misbehaving, but I could of sworn they showed me in a smaller room a Veggie Moses splitting the Nile. 

Hot take but Sunday School treated me like a baby. I really liked normal service, and I probably would still go to church if it wasnâ€™t for Sunday School treating me like a fetus. 

Also I think I was in the room on my own. Like an office room. It might of been played for me to be â€œinitiatedâ€ into Sunday School but I donâ€™t know

Edit: it is a religious show. The later episodes were more focused on being a good person.
