Topic: Nikola Tesla (part 3)

In 1895 Teslaâ€™s New York lab burned, destroying yearsâ€™ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Teslaâ€™s grandiose schemes.

Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feedingâ€”and, he claimed, communicating withâ€”the cityâ€™s pigeons.

Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconiâ€™s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Teslaâ€™s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.

There will be extra information next time.
