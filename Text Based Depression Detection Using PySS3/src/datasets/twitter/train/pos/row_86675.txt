A loss I hoped I wouldn't have to suffer for awhile. I'm more calm than I thought I would be right now. Because, I watched my grandma's last bird slowly descend to lifelessness, hearing the small and heartbreaking squawks and chirps. There were two, a male and female. The female had died first(both died same day/today) albeit confusingly because we didn't know how she did. In the male's case, he was just up on a perch, twitching and rocking himself sort of as we carefully disposes of the female. 

Soon after, the male had flown down to the floor of the cage and continued the twitching and rocking. Then he almost laid flat on his stomach after my mom checked on him real quick. What happened next was sad, to me anyway, he slightly spread his wings and held his head up and started making small chirps and squawks, which weren't too loud, but were heartbreaking to me. After that, he died right there in the cage. 

I just wanted to share with you all. I will be ok and so will my mom and grandma.
