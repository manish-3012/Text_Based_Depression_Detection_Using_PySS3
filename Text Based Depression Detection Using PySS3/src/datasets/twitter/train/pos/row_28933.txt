my dad is so unpredictable when he drinks (and he always fuckin drinkd) but hes usually on the back porch so i dont hve to deal with him but hes in the livin room rn &amp; hes so loud n fuckin

one second he'll be like "baby i love u" to my mom and then the next hes like "fuck u stupid motherfucker." and for some reason he growls and it triggers such a visceral reaction of fear and "i need to get away rn" ugh

and he kept cursin out my dog (???) and then sayin just nasty awful shit and then switchin it up idk it's so scary

i think im kinda panickin rn idk lowkey freakin out but whatever !!! i just hate that i dont have anywhere else to vent coz i fuckin hate makin serious posts here. anyway
