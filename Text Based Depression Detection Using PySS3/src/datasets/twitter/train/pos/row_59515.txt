Ok I know no one will believe me but Iâ€™ve been teleported to an alternate universe where all the social media names are switched. I am so used to calling this site â€œFacebookâ€ but now itâ€™s Reddit despite Reddit being what Facebook (where I came from) hated the most. Please. Where do I go from here.
