I have a theory I dont think people are ever just happy as they are. Its a bit of a far bet, but to my experience and the experience of others i know, it seems like a bit of an illusion. I've never been properly happy and felt complete for more than maybe a few days. Is it a lie fed to us so we buy more shit to make us "happier"? idk. Maybe im crazy, and maybe youre just loving life, but it seems like the more comfortable we are to discuss our feeling the more fucked we all seem to be as a species. Food for thought, if nothing else.
