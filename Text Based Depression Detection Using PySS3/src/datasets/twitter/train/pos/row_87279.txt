Valentine's day is stupid. I'm not just saying this cuz I'm lonely. I just think it's dumb. Its an excuse to make grand gestures and spend money for no reason, the day of love is not Feb 14th it's everyday so that holiday is basically pointless. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ Sure there's history behind it, but there's history behind every holiday and most still become useless excuses to receive gifts and spend money to show that you care. Bruh if u have to look at a calendar and be like "oooh my it's February 14th time to show my partner that I care by wasting money!" Than ur weird. ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ðŸŒˆðŸ³ï¸â€ðŸŒˆðŸ’›ðŸ’—

Happy almost v day y'all ig. Lol ðŸ˜…
