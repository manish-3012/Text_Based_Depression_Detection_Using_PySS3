I was banned from r/ShitLiberalsSay for saying All the adult people I know lived in communism (above 40 or around that number), and they said communism was bad. Wtf, I instantly recived permaban. Like communism is not that bad but their leaders were. My grandfather even started a huge protestating, because a lot of people came with him. You can say communism is good, but experience it first.
