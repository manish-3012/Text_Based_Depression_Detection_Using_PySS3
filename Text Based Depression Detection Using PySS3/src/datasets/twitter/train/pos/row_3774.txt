Crying in Geometry - Cheaters just got wrecked # Average test scores over ZOOM was 87.

My school opened up two weeks ago giving us the option of continuing distance learning or going back to the actual school. We got back our first test yesterday.

# Average score was 25

Our Geometry teacher sent 19 of the 25 students to the in school suspension (ISS) room where the vice principal would be waiting for them to discuss the consequences and their very limited options.  Their parents would be informed of their ISS and why they were there.  That's when the tears started to flow. 

TIL found out what the immediate consequences and their options were:

* Consequences were that those students aren't allowed to try out for Spring sports next week and could not participate in any extracurricular activities or clubs like drama or band.  

* Options were to drop out of Geometry and go to Summer school 20+ miles away in Atlanta.  No transportation provided. Or they could repeat Geometry next year.  

Some parents of those kids are threatening to sue the school and are blaming the school, not their kid.  Parents are mad that more extra help and make up work isn't being offered.  So make up work was offered and that was to re do every homework assignment and test going back to the beginning of the year.  Extra help was always and is still offered for 45 minutes after school every day.  

* My three closest friends and I chose not to go back to school and we're still distance learning, but because we did well on the test other parents accused us and the two other students of cheating which we weren't and the school could prove it because since we had the option of going back to school and most kids chose to school, we were told to position our camera so the teacher could see us actually working out each problem.
