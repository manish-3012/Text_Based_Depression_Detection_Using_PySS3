Fuck Depression and Anxiety! Life is finally taking a good turn for me! Might be weird but 2020 is the very best year of my life! School is going well,I finally got diagnosed with dyslexia so school is finally stopping to consider me a lazy student.  I finally am finding some confidence thanks to the enormous amount of hours spent training this and last year. And I also got GF! SHE IS THE BEST! I really love my life right now
