Please stop posting the aryan guy and the tradwife memes that blonde guy with a beard thats like "yes"and the blonde girl with a flower dress are nazi propaganda, they are based off of nazi steriotypes.

Every time i see a post with those two, even if its "wholesome" i panic, because i dont feel safe, every time theynare posted i feel like im next to a bunch of nazis, and being someone whos family has had direct interactions with fascists, a few of them ending on that relative in jail or dead, it stopped being funny the third time i saw it, because i could recognise what was so familiar about it, its so similar to the propaganda that my grandma had to endure for 40 years, and its terrifying.

its not funny, its not "just a meme" its something that is harmful to people like me. it makes it so i cant feel safe anywhere, i have been thinking about leaving this sub but i decided to make a post before, because i need to tell this, some memes are harmful to people.

(before anyone asks, no, im not jewish, im from spain, a country that was in a fascist  dictatorship for 40 years, people are still affected by it to this day)
