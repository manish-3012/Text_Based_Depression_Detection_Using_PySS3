online education This is a rant but a serious one at the same time.

I canâ€™t keep doing online education. I know itâ€™s the only way but I just canâ€™t do any more of it. I see that thereâ€™s a scheduled meeting so I turn my phone off at that time and just cry because theyâ€™ll probably throw me off the course not knowing my reason. I know these teachers try their hardest but mentally some of us just arenâ€™t able to do this anymore. 


Weâ€™ve been doing it since March then we managed 3 months in person and now weâ€™re back to this, Iâ€™m tired of this, I want it all back to normal which says a lot because normal wasnâ€™t even that good, itâ€™s just better than what weâ€™re currently doing now though and thatâ€™s all I care about.

I donâ€™t care if I fail my course or get thrown off, I feel empty inside but at the same time I feel so many different emotions and not one of them is positive. 

Even though weâ€™re barely 5 days into this year, it has somehow hit harder than the last and I got cheated on last year.
