Weight loss day 25 Today was alright. I had a few more snacks than usual but they were pistachios. I had a good dinner and have been eating more variety with proteins. Iâ€™ve started adding mushrooms, green beans, tofu and different kinds of meat to my food and itâ€™s really filling. Iâ€™m skipping this weekâ€™s weigh in because I forgot on monday but i will be again next week.
