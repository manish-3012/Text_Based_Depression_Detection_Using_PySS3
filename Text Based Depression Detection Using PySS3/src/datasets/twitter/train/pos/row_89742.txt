Hello world Idk what to say . Or what would I say 
Iâ€™ve just been thinking a lot lately and itâ€™s like I need to find my own world 
With my own people . because it feels like Iâ€™m in someone elseâ€™s world . 
I feel stuck in my school , in my city ,in my country . In my planet 
I would love to just break out . I think thatâ€™s what I really need , to find my people .

Maybe friends are like a shoe , some fit us , some donâ€™t . But the big question is if Iâ€™m picking based off if they fit me . Or how do they look 
Like I am just trying to wear a cool shoe thatâ€™s way to big for me 
So I fill it up with something . So it fits . Idk if yâ€™all gettin me 
Am I a hypocrite ?

Iâ€™m just typing whatever appears on my mind ,

Idk where I am going or if there even is a place where I can settle 
Should I just bust through every door and ask everyone whatâ€™s their name ?
Should I try to find myself first . Should I just give up everything and follow my dreams ?

Oh wait , what are my dreams 

Well anyway dm if you want 
Hello world . If this is the last time I see you 
Itâ€™s been nice to meet you
