Give me motivation for tomorrow morning Itâ€™s 3 in the morning where I am and I havenâ€™t finished my homework or college apps. I have chem, calc, English, anthropology, etc. I want it so that when I wake up tomorrow morning and open reddit that I will be have a ton of supportive comments telling me to not give up.

Also day 1 of nnn I didnâ€™t have motivation to want to masturbate either cause I procrastinate everything.
