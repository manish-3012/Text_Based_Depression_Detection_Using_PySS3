I plan on pursuing someone, but I need feedback Hey there! I have plans to pursue someone, but I want to hear your feedback first. She's 17, a senior in high school, and I'm 18, a college freshman. I believe she may be trying to get my attention, as she's beginning to like posts on my private account (although it's the funny stuff I post) and pictures of me on my public account after months of not doing either.

This wouldn't be the first time she's done so either. After my junior year (where we had a class together), when summer break began, she began liking everything I posted on my private account for about two weeks, even on topics she had no interest in (beforehand it was just the memes). Obviously she stopped eventually, but during that time I was just too nervous to hit her up.

With the new year starting, I very well believe this could be a second opportunity. The timing is there. If I pursue her, I'd have to slide into her DMs. The only issue is I never really spoke to her, I'm pretty sure we were too shy to introduce each other. 

Anyways: Should I try to get to know her? If so, how can I keep a convo going? I plan on replying to one of her stories if I do. People think I got good reason to but idk
