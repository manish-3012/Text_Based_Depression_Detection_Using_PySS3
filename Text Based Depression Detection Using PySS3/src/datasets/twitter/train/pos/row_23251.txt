I havenâ€™t felt happy in months No matter what happens good or bad, I either donâ€™t care, or I feel worse. Iâ€™ve never had a lot of friends and I have never enjoyed social events, I always felt disconnected from everyone and awkward. Iâ€™m dissatisfied with my life and yet I canâ€™t motivate myself to change it. I have everything someone my age could want, a big room, a pet, good parents, expensive technology and yet I still feel empty, like something is missing. I hate most people and thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t go outside unless absolutely necessary and I have no social skills. I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m so tired and bored all the time. Covid only made things worse when it gave me plenty of time to think about my future and I see I canâ€™t see myself accomplishing my goals. Am I gonna feel like this forever?
