I'm trying to get better at editing and streaming I uploaded a new vid today and was hoping I could get some specific feedback on it. I stream on twitch as well and use my streams for vids. This one is from a 24hr stream I did, its like 10min and look to improve my skillz. here is link to vid if you want to watch: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po8qk3FTZ9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po8qk3FTZ9Y) 

ps: please don't make the feedback seem too harsh, im a bit sensitive to i guess "rude or mean" criticism.
