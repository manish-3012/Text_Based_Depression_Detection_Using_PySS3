hey so iâ€™m genuinely terrified right now so a while ago i was walking home from the store and it was pretty dark out. and of course by then i was already terrified, i mean iâ€™m a teenaged girl walking home alone at night, a million things could go wrong. so iâ€™m walking fairly quickly and very alert, and notice this guy walking towards me. he looks like heâ€™s not paying attention but itâ€™s just me and this one other man whoâ€™s twice my size, so my fears arenâ€™t exactly calmed. i try to quickly pass him but right as i go by he grabs my ass, and tries to whisper in my ear. before he has the chance i try my best to push him away and book it. as iâ€™m running i *swear* i heard footsteps behind me, but i wasnâ€™t about to look back and check. i get home, slam the door, lock it, and look out the window. it was fairly dark but i could see he was still out there, just looking. it doesnâ€™t help that iâ€™m now home alone. so iâ€™m hiding in my moms room with all the doors and windows locked, sobbing and texting my mom to get home as quickly as she can. idk if heâ€™s still out there but i canâ€™t look and risk him seeing me
