Words of wisdom: Practice makes perfect I have an upcoming chemistry exam and I cant do shit. So I do a lot of practice problems and now I can magically solve them all

The chemical formulas just come up as you read the fucking problem!

Even how stupid you are, If you do something repeatedly you will become better at it. Even primates get better with tools every time they use it

I am hopeful that this applies to social skills too because I have none. This is still in the experimental stage

Just wanna say this, have a good day :)
