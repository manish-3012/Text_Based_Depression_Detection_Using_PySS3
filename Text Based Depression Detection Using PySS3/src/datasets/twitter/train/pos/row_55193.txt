Listen up i have a opinion to share and im pretty angry Why do some pretty pretty girls act like u arent worthy enough for them, and they also act like its a shame that u breathe the same air as them.

Fuck is wrong with them

That u have 2 or 5k insta followers and a pretty face doesnt mean im not worthy as a human. Im not good looking but atleast i am friendly to everyone
