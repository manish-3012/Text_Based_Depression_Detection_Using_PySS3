Grooming advices So, I recently just got in a relationship (not really but I'll write like that so that I can get to the point) and my girl doesn't like hairs in the torso.

First time I tried it took 3 hours, now after the 4th it just took 1 hour, but still too much, and it's a pain in the ass, since my hair growth is fucking abnormal.

How do guys cut their Hairs in the torso? Is there a way to cut them permanently or that last way longer? 

I do have also some questions on how to cut down there, but I feel like with some focus I'm getting better and faster for the southern area
