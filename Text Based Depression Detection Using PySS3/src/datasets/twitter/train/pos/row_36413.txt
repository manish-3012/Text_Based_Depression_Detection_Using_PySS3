What do people mean when they talk to or ask their doctor about something? I always hear people tell people to ask their doctor about blah blah blah, but you guys have your own doctors? I have never had one specific person or doctor for myself and had always had to go to urgent care or the hospital if I had to do anything medical related and by a different person/doctor each time. How do you get your own doctor
