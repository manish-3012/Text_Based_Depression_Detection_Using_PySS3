I know this is sorta old but Iâ€™m so happy rocket league is going free to play. Iâ€™m so happy that this is happening ngl. When epic games bought psyonix last year I hoped this would happen and what do you know. Deadass the items you get if you already owned the game before look really good. Iâ€™m just so hyped that more people will start to play my favourite game. I hope RLCS and other torneys gain way more traction and idk. Itâ€™s just so cool that theyâ€™re making the game free by the end of summer(Iâ€™m 99.9% confident itâ€™s gonna go free at the end of August because thatâ€™s when this seasons RP ends. Iâ€™m just so hyped ngl
