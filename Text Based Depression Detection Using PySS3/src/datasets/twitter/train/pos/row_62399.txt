I did something epic in Rocket League So im rank silver now and rank bronze last season, i started last year December and yeah i love the game. And for the Rocket League Nerds, the thing that i did is (i think) called a Aerial Team Pinch, at least thats what i call it now. It didnt had much power but still, best thing ive ever done
