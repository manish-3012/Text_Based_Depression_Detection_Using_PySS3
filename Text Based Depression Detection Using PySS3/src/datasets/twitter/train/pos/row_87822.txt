Does anyone feel that NoFap displays cult like behaviour? Same with stuff like Forex and what not. They got sooooo toxic about it if you politely say you aren't interested in what they are. I don't have a problem with NoFap and if it helps people then great but just don't get so toxic about it. Anyone else feel the same way?
