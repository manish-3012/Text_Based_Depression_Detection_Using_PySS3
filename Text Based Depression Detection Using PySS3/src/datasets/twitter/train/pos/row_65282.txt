I is happy i know this is late but this past Sunday i went to a girls house that i had been talking to for about a couple months and i finally got the courage to ask her out and she said yes. i donâ€™t know if any of you guys care but i just felt like telling someone so i thought why shouldnâ€™t i just talk about it on this sub.
