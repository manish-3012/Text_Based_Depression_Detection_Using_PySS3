A grandpa trying to be hip to bond with his teenage grandson. (skateboards in) Hey there my grandson! (dabs) It's me, your granddad! (pulls down sunglasses) Wanna head to the arcade later? Or maybe play some (hits the whip) pogs? We can play until about 6 pm, but then you gotta do your Spanish homework! (re-adjusts bling) I know, total bummer, but once youâ€™re done, you can play that new Nintendo of yours! (Fiddles with glowstick bracelet) That game with the Pikachu looks epic!
