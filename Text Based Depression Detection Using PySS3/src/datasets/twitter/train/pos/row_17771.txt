lmao jesus fuck i left a server not too long ago full of people from here i met in december and no one gave a shit i sensed the feeling that no one really liked me in there, and iâ€™ll stop listening to my intuition the day it is wrong, which is to say i was right. i was doing pretty rough and no one gave a shit when i mentioned it once so i just left. 

one of the guys in there was someone who fake flirted with me and played with my feelings. like iâ€™d agree to kinda date him and he would be like â€œsureâ€ and then nothing would change, like we werenâ€™t dating. so i cut him out, everywhere. 

idk, iâ€™m kinda waiting for the part where things get better
