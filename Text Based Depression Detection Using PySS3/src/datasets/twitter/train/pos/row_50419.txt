I think 2 of my friends broke up but like it's hard to tell So the girly updated her Instagram bio but left him out, but that doesn't mean anything I hear you say. I remember the dude having more pictures on his Instagram but low and behold its mostly car pictures now. So I go back to the girly's Instagram and notice that one picture was missing. I didn't recognize it at first, luckily the way back time machine had a capture from like a month ago and the picture that was missing was of them together. So I am pretty sure they split but it was so quiet I don't even know how long ago this happened... a shame they were cute together 

On a related note I was mentioned on our schools gossip Instagram page for being "cute" and they noted that I own 2 cars. There is only 1 class where I talk and the girly happens to be in it. There are a couple other possible suspects for the sender of the anonymous message but when I mentioned it the girly replied to my store asking who I thought it was. I couldn't say her (cuz as far as I knew she still had a bf). But it still seems pretty sus to me... I need a taco
