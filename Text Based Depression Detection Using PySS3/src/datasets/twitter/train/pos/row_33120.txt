Today was not my day... So I donâ€™t know what to flair this, but I guess relationship fits. 

To start off, itâ€™s my birthday, Iâ€™ve turned 18.

So I had a very close relationship with a feral cat (sheâ€™s a good cat). Originally, when she gave birth to 2 kittens we were gonna spayed her after giving birth, but lockdown started. During the lockdown, she got pregnant again. So I had nothing to do but take care of them until itâ€™s somewhat safe (it was 3 kittens during her second litter). 

Those 2 cats were not just only cute, but they were special! When we hit positive for covid and had to quarantine ourselves, they just came up to us and snuggle, even after putting them outside, they cried/beg to get in. They sat and slept like a human, binge watch TV shows, one of them always like the McDonald or anything with food ads, and the other one try to open a DOOR, A DOOR!! 

My family and those cats had a roller coaster ride, we all went sick, we cried, we celebrated as well, even if theyâ€™re not human. Sadly, those two couldnâ€™t see me turning 18. 

Fast forwarding, we put those 2 special kittens in a no kill shelter. I held my tears until I got home, seeing them in the website made me cry even more. I witness them cry/meow a lot during the ride, which hurts me to see. It was a good 4 months with them. 

For those who are wondering, they both got adopted (an hour later after I dropped them off), so Iâ€™m somewhat happy but still sad that I separated them from their mother and brother.
