Guide to find which one-digit number(s) can divide an integer So . . . I've just rummaged through my old stuff, and found my old school notes. So . . . Maybe, I can share some knowledge with you, about the rules to find if a number is divisible by a particular one digit numbers.

A number is divisible by :

* 1 : If the number is an integer
* 2 : If the number is an even number
* 3 : If the sum of all digits in a number is divisible by 3
* 4 : If the last two digits is divisible by 4
* 5 : If the number ends in 0 or 5
* 6 : If the number is even, and the sum of all digits is divisible by three
* 7 : No particular rules or anything like that, sorry
* 8 : If the final three digits are divisible by 8
* 9 : If the sum of all digits in a number is divisible by 9

Oh, and ignore zero, please.

Now, stay healthy and have a nice day!
