Communication skills (I don't even know what's wrong) I don't know if it's only me, but I really do have a problem communicating with someone. I don't have many friends, I'm bad at talking etc. But the moment I realized this was today, while talking to my crush. I simply asked her if she knew I liked her, and she said if I somehow could even make it less obvious. She then asked me if I really wanted her to know about this, and I went with a "no, just making sure". She then proceeds to ask how is that feeling like, probably because she never felt it. I tell her that it is a strange feeling. She asks me if it is good or bad. I said "It changes. It is good at first, but then you realize the fact that you don't even have a chance with her, and then everything goes downhill". She then asks if it is, in fact, bad, based off on what I just said. I reply with a "No, it's just strange". She then tells me she is trying to understand, and I emphasize it's probably hard. Then I tell her that at least I am sure she knows it now, and she replies with "Probably".  


  


So, the problem here is that I don't see how this conversation is bad. But when I tell it to one of my friends, he asks what the actual fuck this is, and proceeds to tell me that this isn't how you do it.   


  
I don't know what I did wrong, I don't even know if I did wrong, but give me advice, I am bad at communicating with people.
