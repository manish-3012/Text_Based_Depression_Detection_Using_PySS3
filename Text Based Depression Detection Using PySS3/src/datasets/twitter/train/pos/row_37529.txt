Hey, guys. I just need to get this out of my (17F) system Everything just sucks right now lol. I had a crush on my guy friend for a year and, with the help of my friends hyping me up, decided to confess to him. Long story short, he rejected me after continuously giving me signs that he also liked me too. All of my friends even thought he liked me. To make it worse, right after he rejected me he started sending me flirtatious memes, again making me think he liked me back. Now our friendship is strained and I'm hurt because it feels like he's just playing with my emotions.

I barely have any friends and the few I do have don't actually care about me anyway. All of my friendships fall apart and I've been ghosted so many times that I've lost a lot of confidence. I just feel like no one cares about me for me.

I've never been in a relationship and, although a few guys have told me I'm attractive, they never bother to try and get to know me or even talk to me at all. One guy I barely know actually hit me up trying to make out and have sex, like I'm not even a person, just some object. I'm just feeling so worthless right now. The rejection is hitting hard and no one wants to be my friend.

To top it off, I've started losing large amounts of hair due to a sudden condition. My senior picture is in two weeks and I don't know what to do. I just hate myself so much right now.
