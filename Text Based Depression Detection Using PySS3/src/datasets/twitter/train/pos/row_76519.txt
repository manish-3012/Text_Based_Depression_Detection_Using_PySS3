Anyone else just give up on doing homework sometimes or am I the only one?  I do homework sometimes and sometimes I don't, so the grades in my classes are pretty mixed. My parents tell my i'm throwing my life away bc some of my grades are bad and I lose sleep thinking about it. So can anyone relate or am I just deadass the only person who doesn't have the best grades in all their classes?
