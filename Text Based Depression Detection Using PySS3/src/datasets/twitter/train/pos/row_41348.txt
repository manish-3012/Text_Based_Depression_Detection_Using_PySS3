had my first kiss yesterday so am now an expert on it here are some tips for you lip virgins out there 1. chapstick. wear chapstick and apply it often. flavored is good, as long as it isnt a weird flavor like hot chocolate or smt. fruit flavor maybe, or mint. i wore cherry
2. tilt your head slightly
3. open your mouth just a little
4. don't hold too long
5. dont be too aggressive, try to read how much they're into it and how long they're holding, how hard they're pushing back, and try to match that

(these tips are for pecks, not making out)
