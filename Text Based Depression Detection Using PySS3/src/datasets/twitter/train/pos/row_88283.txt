My best friend and I act like a couple, said by others I love my best friend very much and we are so close that people thought of us as a couple. We are both girls but she has a boyfriend. I don't have any romantic feelings for her neither is she. We are both in a religious group, so same gender couple aren't allowed because it is forbidden in the bible. We don't have anything against gay, lesbian, etc. In fact, we respect them and our church mates even made joke about us as a couple. We hold hands and hug each other, and we would talk about that we're attracted to our same gender. So, talking with her is very comfortable. She's open-minded and so am I. I love the fact, that we had so much in common, that she is like a sister to me.
