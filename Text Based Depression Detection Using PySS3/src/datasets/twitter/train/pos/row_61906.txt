Stop with "If you don't know this cartoon, you didn't have a childhood" I am from Central Europe and we didn't have cable or satellite TV. So I didn't get some of the cartoons you got, like Idk... Kim Possible or Ben 10.

My childhood is Pat a Mat, JuroÅ¡Ã­k, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam. VeÄernÃ­Äky simply.


Luw you. Bye
