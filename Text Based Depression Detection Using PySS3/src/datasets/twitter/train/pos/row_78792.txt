i wish people wouldnâ€™t text me as much as they do i guess im just antisocial as fuck. i love my friends but i have two of them that feel the need to be texting me all day every day and i just get mentally exhausted from texting all the time. i end up deliberately waiting an hour or two in between texts because i just need time to do my own thing

to be honest i would be perfectly happy only talking to my friends when hanging out in person, i need my personal time to recharge but i canâ€™t do that when im always talking to someone
