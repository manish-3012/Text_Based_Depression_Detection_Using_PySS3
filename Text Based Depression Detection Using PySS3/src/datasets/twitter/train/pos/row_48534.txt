What's been going on with this sub recently. I know this sub's always been bad but recently it seems to be getting much worse.
There seems to be more and more LGBTQ+phobia, racism, misogyny, etc. and the posts always seem to be highly voted.

But the most noticeable is definitely the recent influx of incels. They just seem to be everywhere and there's always other people agreeing with them.
