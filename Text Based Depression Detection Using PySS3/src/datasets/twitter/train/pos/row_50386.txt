I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m depressed or a normal teen I feel lonely, sad, and I want to die on a daily basis. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m depressed or just doing normal teen stuff. I hate my family, because my sister and my mom always team up on me when I just want to do the one thing that makes me happy which is play video games with my friends. I worked all summer to buy a pc and they made me put it in the middle of the house where everyone can hear them screaming. I want to kill myself. And when I try to tell my family how I feel my mom says if I donâ€™t like it I should move out. But if I move out I donâ€™t know who to go to.
