day 3 of giving y'all girl advice until everyone stops posting about being single ok so all there is for today's lesson is looking. Some girls like it when guys stare. It makes us feel important and noticed. If she catches you staring, just glance somewhere else. Its that simple. Usually doing this for a few weeks will make any girl like you just because she feels that you notice her. good luck
