What should i do now? So i got into a fight with my father because i had a different opinion with him and he started saying "well too bad nobody cares about your opinion because you are a kid and you should just shut up and listen to what i say" so i told him i cant listen to his opinion if he dont care about mine which he found very inappropriate and he told me to pronounce a word in english (very random i know but we are from syria) and i refuse to say anything because it doesnot matter whatever i say, so now he is very angry and my mom thinks im a disgrace on this family because of this but i told i did nothing wrong , so guys am i wrong or what please tell me i will listen
P.s: male 16
