I have literally never tried so hard in my life.. I have never given this much shit about anything- I even stayed up all night multiple times doing work and trying to understand shit and after all of this I still manage to fail... I guess I really am a failure. This is my limit and I cant do shit from here on up. Thank you so much school for telling me what I amount to and what my limits are really great, love to know it.
