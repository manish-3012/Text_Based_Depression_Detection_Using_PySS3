Iâ€™m leaving Reddit Like this is gonna get offensive but a lot of the people are just annoying, like I really canâ€™t stand it, people just complain so much about the dumbest thing, like I made a joke about how this woman looked like a cat fish with makeup and I said â€œthat should be a felonyâ€ instead of people take the obvious joke they got all mad, like people love to argue, Iâ€™m gonna get hate but on all the social media Iâ€™ve used Reddit is just different. People just wanna argue for hours, over the dumbest things, thereâ€™s no such thing as a respectful disagreement, especially a lot of the girls,(not all) but some call you incel just for disagreeing. Itâ€™s annoying af, and the gender war JESUS CHRIST. 

Itâ€™s like I canâ€™t go 5 seconds without someone talking about how hard being a woman is and if a disagree Iâ€™m a piece of shit, if you donâ€™t have a poplar opinion on something like I said â€œI donâ€™t like people lying and calling me attractive I want the truthâ€ Iâ€™m getting so much hate, the people are Annoying.and the worst part is when people bring up their life stories like oh my god, Iâ€™ve heard like 10 peoples backgrounds because we disagreed when I made a post saying â€œyou shouldnâ€™t get offended by jokes, itâ€™s just gonna hurt you more you should ignore themâ€, this girl was calling me a piece of shit because she said it was hard to ignore the people that made comments about her past, like I just said â€œdonâ€™t take it seriouslyâ€ but she was cussing me out saying she wanted to killer herself, even made a post about me convincing every girl that saw it that I was an asshole, even though she was cussing me out, because I said â€œdonâ€™t take offensive jokes seriously, itâ€™s just gonna hurt you moreâ€, the people on Reddit arenâ€™t normal chill people than you can just vibe with, itâ€™s not like other social media, even TikTok the people are more chill, everyday, itâ€™s like someone gets a boner/gets wet everything they see an opportunity to argue or get offended.
