Aight I need to tell you something. Look this post is about the Armenian-Azerbaijan war that's going on right now and the only reason its a text post is that I can't draw and this is a serious topic. If you haven't heard about it than I'm gonna give you a run down. Basically over the past 20 days Azerbaijan has broken the cease-fire that was created some 20 years ago so they can take the Nagomo-Karabakh area. Now the only reason I make this post is because I am angered that the US media barely reports on this topic. I know that there is an election coming up but it's a war. Now I highly suggest you look into this and I really want more people to see this post. Thank you for reading.
