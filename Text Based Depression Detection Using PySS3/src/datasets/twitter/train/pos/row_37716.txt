screw school Middle school was the glory days they said. Middle school you get to start fresh they said. Middle school was fun they said. Now in reality I'm dying on the inside. Normally I have very little homework. But the day I hear I have a test I got stuff that will affect my grade greatly. They were all assigned on the same day and there all due in 2 days. THANKS A LOT SCHOOL.
