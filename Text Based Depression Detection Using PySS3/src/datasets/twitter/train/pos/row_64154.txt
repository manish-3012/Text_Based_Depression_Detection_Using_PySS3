I just had a very weird dream and also discovered one of the saddest places in the world in the process And that place is...

Grandmaâ€™s House but grandma isnt there

In the dream there Was some kind of celebration going on, and everyone, My grandma included, Was at My House. Including grandma. But then me and another Person (who was An anime character but also apparently they were My family member in the dream) had to go walk our dogs. And for whatever reason we decided to go to grandmaâ€™s House even though grandma Was at our House. But when we got in it felt super empty. One of the dogs we were Walking Was My grandmaâ€™s, and she Was sniffing around all normal but because grandma wasnâ€™t there the place felt so incredibly wrong that i needed up waking up.

The dream Was super weird in other ways too but it would take way too long to explain and this Was the part that stuck with me the most.
