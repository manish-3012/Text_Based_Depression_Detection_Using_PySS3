Guys what do I do My girlfriend broke up with me and we were together for nine months and everything reminds me of her. I had to get rid of a hat and a jacket because they remind me of her, Ive stopped playing games that I enjoy because they remind me of her. I was told to write down everything that reminded me of her and if it made me upset or not, and then why I felt the way I did about it in a journal but now I can't even look at the journal without being brought to the brink of tears. How do I move on.
