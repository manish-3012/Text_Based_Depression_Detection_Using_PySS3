That time a pedophile was a substitute teacher So in 5th or 6th grade(So I was 10-12) and at some point during the day I heard from my friends that their substitute teacher was eyeing them up. That was weird and then during recess I had to do a lap because I must have gotten in trouble. When as I reached the end he was standing there. I saw him, hoping my friends were lying. I felt his glaze on my, a chill going up my spine, my whole body feeling uncomfortable. At first I was walking now I was sleepwalking past. Later, I heard he was fired. Years later in 8th grade I brought up him to a friend and she talked about how there were rumors of how he tried to kidnap a kid. The worst part for me was that he //did// eye up both genders. Fuckin' bisexuals am I right. That was a joke.
