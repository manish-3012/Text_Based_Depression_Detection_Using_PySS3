Some Animal Crossing opinions I have: 1. Wolves are the best Animal Crossing villager species.

2. All of the Hippo villagers are really fucking terrible, and I believe all of the Hippo villagers should be exterminated as a whole.

3. Beau, Raymond, Judy, and Marshall are good villagers, but they are way OVERRATED in the Animal Crossing community.

4. Anteaters are probably the most underrated Animal species, Annalise and Olaf are really great villagers.

5. I miss it when the Animal Crossing Villagers weâ€™re actually mean to you. Just saying.
