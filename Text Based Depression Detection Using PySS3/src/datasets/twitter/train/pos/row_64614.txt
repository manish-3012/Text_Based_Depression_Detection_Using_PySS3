I just got off of fall break! EVERY FUCKING ASSIGNMENT IS A FUCKIN TEST. How the hell am I supposed to do 5 tests back to back and pass all of them? Answer: The school doesn't give a fuck. And speaking of that, I just spent 30 minutes taking a one of the tests to get a 64% and fail. I'm so fuckin over school. I just want it to be over, I want to sleep, I just want to stop. It's too much for me, and here I am making a post on Reddit while the test timer goes down. :(
