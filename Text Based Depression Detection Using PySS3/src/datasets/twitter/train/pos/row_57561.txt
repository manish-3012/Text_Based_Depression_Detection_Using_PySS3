Anyone wanna share their Spotify playlists? I need to do some homework, and I need new music, so please share your Spotify playlists!! If I like them, we can even talk about music for a bit :)

Some artists I like for a bit of a reference on my taste: Loveleo, Burzum, Viagra Boys, The Drums, Wallows, Crumb, Forth Wanderers, Dreamcrusher, Molchat Doma, King Gizzard and the Lizard wizard, Haru Nemuri, Jpegmafia, Death Grips, Pizzalove, etc...
