Hey ladies and gents, have you ever been scared of the dark? Well oh boy do I have the trick for you. Now this might sound silly but just trust me. Lets say your in your room and that coat at the corner of the room looks a little scary "what do I do?" you might ask, well don't you worry my friend. All you have to do is look at what ur getting scared by and say "fuck you" with your middle fingers up. ORRR lets say ur scared cuz you think ur being followed you can either say "look bro ik your following me just come out already" (only use this if you know there isn't anyone else looking at you). Make sure to say that in the most bored tone possibly, turn around and walk away calmly. 

(jokes aside this actually works for me)
