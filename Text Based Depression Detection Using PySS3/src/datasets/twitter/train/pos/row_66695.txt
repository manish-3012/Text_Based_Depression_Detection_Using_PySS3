Finding a long lost friend Ik no one will care abt this but i need some help.

Teens of reddit, i have a long lost friend that i would give anything to see him again. His name is David. Weâ€™ve been friends since i first moved to holyoke. Hes a blonde with braces, and has the bluest eyes ive ever seen. Ik it doesnt sound like much but he helped me thru some hard times. I live across from his grandmas house. 

Idk if he still sees his grandma or whatever but i do want to get in contact again. Latest i saw him was when he was skateboarding late at night listening to the fuckin bombest music. But anyway, plz help me find him. Its kinda hard with no picture but thx anyway ðŸ™‚
