Man where did the timeline go wrong 2016 and 2017 were such great years... After that it hasnt been the same since... Shittt if I could find my way back to those points in time with 0 knowledge of the future im all for it

God i miss just posting everything on my page back then and i miss talking to people i didnt know well i miss just enjoying myself way too much

I was a fool back then but it was worth it. Sure i didnt have many friends then (and still dont now) but i knew how to entertain
