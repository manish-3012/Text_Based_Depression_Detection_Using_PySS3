I need braces I went to the dentist earlier to have my teeth cleaned and checked up on, and I didnâ€™t have any concerns, although some chatting amongst the dentist and his assistant (apprentice I think) made me wonder if I was going to need a retainer for an overbite or an underbite. But no. I know I have some crooked teeth, but I didnâ€™t really care. Turns out some of my teeth are blocking other teeth from coming in, so I need some teeth pulled *and* braces. Braces were literally the last things I wanted. Iâ€™ve heard they hurt a lot, and you need to avoid certain foods. I donâ€™t want that. I donâ€™t know what I can or canâ€™t eat or drink! Will I be able to satiate my Orange Juice addiction? Will I be able to eat my dadâ€™s Butter Chicken and Beef and Broccoli? Will I even survive the pain?
