Would you help out a teen who desperately needs relationship advice? So my girlfriend (16F) and I (17M) are in a long distance relationship and because of our situations we can't meet until 2 years from now. Now, my household is a strict household and my parents don't know about her. Meaning I can't call her or facetime her. And she's really upset about that.
Now, I love her. And she says she loves me too. Recently, things got complicated and now she's considering if she's bi. Which is fine of course. That's not the problem.
Her and I are both mostly inexperienced and neither of us has had their first kiss and she's been telling me about how she thinks her teen years are getting wasted.
Now here's the problem. A few nights ago she told me she feels like I'm not enough for her. And even though she loves me, there are things she wants to do that she can't do with me. And then she said "I want something physical with someone."
I'm not being dumped. She wants a hookup with someone. Just once, apparently. Or at least that's what she wants rn, but she said she wants me in her life.
I asked if I might get replaced. She said we might not be a couple anymore, but she still wants us to be close.
Now all of this hurts. And she said I can say no. But based on how much I know her, things won't end if I say no. The argument woll come up again and again till I'm ready to say yes to her and let her do what she wants to.
I don't want to lose her. And this hurts so much. What should I do?
