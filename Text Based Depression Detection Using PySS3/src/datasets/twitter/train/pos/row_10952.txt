Got my report card, My grades flunked. So, normally i'm a good student, with high grades. Until last year, my lowest grade ever was a B. 

However, last year my teacher was a bitch. I know i should probably be respectful since he's HeLpInG mE LeArN, but he didn't. He gave me detention for the most pointless reasons, He constantly picked me for reading or answering the questions at the front of the room as much as he could even though he knows i have a horrible case of stage fright (The principal HIMSELF told the teacher to let me do independant work more often then group work but he didn't care), And the worst thing is, he let me get beaten up. He did yard patrol most of the time during lunch and I got picked on every day. One time in early january a group of kids were throwing big chunks of ice at me and mainly targeting my face/head. The teacher saw and instead of coming to break it up since he knew i couldn't defend myself against over 7 kids stronger then me, he walked away SMILING. I got a concussion and my teeth are now damaged. I'm lucky i don't need braces. I was away for over 2 weeks because of my injuries. 

my grades that year were in between A-'s and C+'s. I was so dissapointed.

I'm doing online school this year and i'm often confused in what we're doing because i have problems focusing and i'm really anxious. the only good thing is that my online teacher is really nice and helps me catch up, but he can't change my grades. My best mark was a B+ and the lowest was C-. I feel ashamed and disgusted in myself. I heard he got fired but i don't know or care, As long as he leaves me alone.

Thanks for listening to my little rant, Just wanted to get it out of my system.
