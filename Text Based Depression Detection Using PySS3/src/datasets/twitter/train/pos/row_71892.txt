Seeing all the wallstreetbets guys makes me think... should we review bomb RobinHood because it manipulates the stock market? I mean bruh they won't let people buy stocks from blackberry and gamestop and such and us teens can't do much but I feel like jumping in just because lmao

Anyway how's it going?
