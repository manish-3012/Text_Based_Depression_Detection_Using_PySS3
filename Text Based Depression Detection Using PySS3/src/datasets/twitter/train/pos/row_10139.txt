It seems another reddit year has passed. Here are some things I would like to say: I'll start with something that has been bothering me for a while: it really feels like the end of the world as we know it.

And now, some other stuff:
1. Don't open something nsfw on reddit, unless you know exactly what subreddit you're on (learned that the hard way)

2. If you're having online classes, we all feel your pain. Also, this means you don't really see people in person anymore or have large social gatherings (yay for introverts) 

3. It's very easy to just sit around in bed all day and do nothing. However, it is very nice to have a routine and healthy too. Take some online courses! Learn some new skills! Take up a hobby!

4. Don't do what I did - if you want to ask someone out, just do it. You're not going to see them anyway in person, so it'll be less awkward.

5. Take care of yourself. I can't stress this enough. Physical and mental health are really important. Take some time for yourselves and get some workouts done. Meditate if that helps, or at least try if you haven't.

6. As unimportant as it may seem, school has it's benefits, so don't skip classes. Your teachers will appreciate it even if you just attend the first few minutes of class and go.

Lastly, remember that you are important, and you have the potential to be the most talented, most interesting and extraordinary person in the universe. And that you are capable of amazing things, if you put your mind to it.
