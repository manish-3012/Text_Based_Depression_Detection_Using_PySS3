To all my fellow gals, you dont need to be overtly sexual to be empowered I feel like people dont say this enough so Iâ€™m saying it again. You can be an empowered woman/girl and not want to flaunt your body. You can be an empowered woman and want to flaunt your body. Empowered women let other women do what they want to do. Everybody is talking about WAP and Iâ€™m only seeing either hate or aggressive love. Iâ€™m mostly seeing posts targeted at younger women BY WOMEN about how THAT is what progressive femininity looks like and if you dont agree you are anti feminism. No. Thatâ€™s not right. Thatâ€™s one half of the whole picture. You can disagree personally and let other women do what they please. But its hella anti female to only allow women to fit your one idea of women should be and its just overtly sexual. Some gals just dont vibe like that and they shouldnt be societally pushed to be that way. Literally every girl that bullied me in hs weaponized the overtly sexual strategy to become popular and get the dudes and then clown every other girl who didnt do that. Not empowerment. Real women let women do their thing man. Anyways you beautiful stay winnin &lt;3
