Turns out a girl I really like likes me back There's this girl who I've known for years now and she's always been my closest friend. She's the first person I came out to as bisexual, she's supported me through lots of things. And over time I've developed a crush on her. 

Apparently she's told some of our friends that she likes me and they've told me that she told them. 

What do I do???? Should I just not bring this up and wait untill the time is right??? When will that be???
