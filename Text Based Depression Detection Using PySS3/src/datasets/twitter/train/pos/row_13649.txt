What are some good low profile over-ear headphones? I would be using these primarily for music at school (hence the low profile) and would rather they be wired, or as long as it sounds good with music I am fine with it. Preferably under $100, any help would be appreciated.


Budget: $100-125 USD

Source/Amp: iPod touch 6th gen

How the gear will be used: At school, listening to music, preferably low to no audio leakage.

Preferred tonal balance: Any (I don't really know much about this stuff, any advice is also helpful).

Preferred music genre(s): Rap (Eminem, Logic, etc)

Past gear experience: previously only used a cheap pair of Bluetooth earbuds, the didn't really sound to great. My other choice is the Logic G935 wireless headset, used an aux cord to plug it in to my device, although it sounds good, it is really bulky.

What aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve?: The audio quality of the music, whole still being sleek/low profile in design.
