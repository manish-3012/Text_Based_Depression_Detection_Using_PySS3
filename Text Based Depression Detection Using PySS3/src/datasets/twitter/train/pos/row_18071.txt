Hi, sorry this is so long :( My father is an achololic, he sobered up for maybe a year than told us he was "sober" for a whole year after that but he recently told me he relapsed. He has already been to the hospital several times, and I'm afraid things may really go down hill if he doesn't stop. He refuses to get professional help, and says he cam handle it nut obviously he can't. Today he left for work and has yet to come home, my mom got a hold of him and apparently he is in a parking lot drinking. I love him with all my heart, and that's what, makes this so tough. 

No one will talk to me so I thought I might get some support from you guys.
