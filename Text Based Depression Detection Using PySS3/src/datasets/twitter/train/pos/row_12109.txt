Everyone wish me luck, my teacher might just murder me tomorrow So my school just had a half term (week off) and my business teacher set us a project to do during the break. We needed to create a business and write up a business plan for it.

Now me and my brother thought it would be a great idea to take the piss and decided to make a business called â€œSpin the willâ€

A summary of our business is that itâ€™s a funeral company/gameshow, where if you canâ€™t decide what to leave to who in your will, when you die you can put your relatives on a gameshow where they spin a wheel with all of your possessions on it to see what they inherit.

We spent a good amount of time on this and it has a pretty good amount of business terms and aspects in it, the only thing we overlooked was ethics.

The best/worst part is our slogan. â€œWe put the fun in funeralâ€

Everyone feel free to leave your thoughts on this wonderful business
