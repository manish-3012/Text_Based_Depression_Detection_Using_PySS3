My life right now I literally just woke up from the middle of my sleep just to realize I'm a fat ugly loser who has no friends who will never be able to get in a relationship, I'll just die alone. What's the point in trying anymore? Girls standards are way too high.  I can shoot my shot but I'll just be rejected anyway. I'm an extreme introvert. I'm never social. Nobody talks to me or even starts conversation with me unless they're my friends. I just stay in my room all day play video games sleep and eat. That's all I do I have a very sad life right now. I'm not even an adult yet but yet I feel like that this will become my life in the future.
