Why does my mom always feel the need to talk so loud to me and yell at me super loud when speaking to me? Legit everytime we are around peopoe she tries to talk as loud as fucking possible and when around people sheâ€™ll just wander around Idk if she is trying to mess with my aspergers and social anxiety but ok
