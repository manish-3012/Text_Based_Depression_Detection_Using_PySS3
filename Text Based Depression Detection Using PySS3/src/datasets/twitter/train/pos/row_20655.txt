IM FINALLY GETTING HIM! I know a lot of people wonâ€™t care but I finally got confirmation on my dream fish!!! Iâ€™m neurodivergent and my main hyper fixation is fish, and Iâ€™ve always wanted one of these boys!!! Heâ€™s the most beautiful betta Iâ€™ve ever seen and I spent so long saving up for him, Iâ€™m just waiting to contact the transhipper to get him here from Thailand!
