Would I be stupid to break up with my gf? Basically she told me that when she was 14, she was in love with a 20 year old, and they kissed. We're both 17 now, and I love her a lot. But I cant get over that. I know it makes me immature and superficial, but I feel disgusted and sick when I think about them kissing. She's way out of my league and I love everything else about her, it's just this one thing.
