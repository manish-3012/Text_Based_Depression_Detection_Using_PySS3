i fucked up so a few days ago me and my mom were looking for books for school, but the website threw us out and we couldnt get in again for some reason. And to clarify, ive NEVER watched porn or anything like that in my life, im just not a big fan of it. However,  I do spent a lot of time on reddit, and I learned there that you can never show anyone your browser history because it looks like everyone on reddit watches porn and stuff, and someone would see that. So my mom couldnt get in the website again and decides to OPEN MY BROWSER HISTORY. So I freak out and grab my laptop out of her hands and at that moment I realise that I look very sus because I didnt wanted my mom to see my browser history but I only look up videogames and things that I need to know for school, but I just intstantly reacted without thinking and now my mom probarly thinks that I watch porn :(

TLDR: I didnt want my mom to look at my browser history and now she thinks that I watch porn.
