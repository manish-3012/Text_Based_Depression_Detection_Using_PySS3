Iâ€™ve turned my 10-year old sister into a weeb... ...well, according to her sheâ€™s a weeb. sheâ€™s on the fourth season of naruto and sheâ€™s already watched sonic-x and avatar (which doesnâ€™t rly count as an anime). sheâ€™s gonna watch MHA next. sheâ€™s not an official weeb yet, sheâ€™s got at least 30 animeâ€™s to go until she gets that title. youâ€™ll also prolly see her on reddit some time soon..
