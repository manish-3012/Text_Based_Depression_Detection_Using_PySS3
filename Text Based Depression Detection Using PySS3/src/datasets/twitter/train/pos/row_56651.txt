i just dont know what to do Im in first year university, but sometimes i feel like i won't even make it past first year and live a healthy sustainable life. I have horrible health anxiety, I always think im going to get a fatal disease, specifically brain diseases. 

I just keep thinking im going to die. I don't want to die. I have horrible, horrible, health anxiety. I stayed up all night googling brain fatal diseases and seeing how anyone can get it and i always think im going to eventually have it. I keep thinking ill be those rare 1% that gets xyz brain disease.

Why?? relationship wise nothing ever goes my way. I meet a girl i start to like we talk then boom  she leaves me/becomes distant.

I cry to myself a lot because i want a healthy life. I don't want diseases. I don't want brain diseases. Please God. I beg. My health anxiety is honetly so severe i cant let myself hold it anymore and need to vent it out. 

i need comforting words. I hate living like this. Last year i was so happy, i had very minimal health anxiety and right now it's fucking sky rocketing through the roof to the point its getting too much for me.

I just dont know what to do
