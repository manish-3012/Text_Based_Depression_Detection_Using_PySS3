I love when u make an effort to text someone and the one day u donâ€™t say anything itâ€™s complete silence and when u finally do say something they donâ€™t even leave u on read Like bruh did I say something wrong? Did I offend u? Am I boring? Annoying? Stupid? Am I just not worth ur time? Do u hate me? Why are you ignoring me? 

Even worse if u text them in class and u see them on snap and then they just donâ€™t respond to u at all.

Or I get ppl asking for homework answers and only that 24/7, it hurts. Whatâ€™s wrong with me to the point where all Iâ€™m worth giving is some dumb answers to a class you wonâ€™t even pass? Am I that boring that u feel the need to go out of your way to not reply to me even tho Ik u can see I texted u? 

So many questions ðŸ˜”
