FloresLava's Minecraft Server? *new* Bedrock/Java Crossplay/Hub/New/Anomalies/weirdbugs?(not laggy) Hi! Would you like to join this new sprouting Minecraft or Discord server?  
Small community but I want to grow more and more with each update to the server! Java or Bedrock user may join and play together here, right now enjoy a new Survival world which is epic! PvP, economy, claims, party teleport, more to come most definitely! If you like to build creatively we have a server for that aswell! My plan is to introduce a mini-games server once the survival world has all the bugs crinked out! (Some chunk errors occured in this world) It is totally fine you may find weird anomolies like underground villages! I WILL be regenerating these chunks for 1.17 unless claimed!  
Please join our Discord and fill out an application!
