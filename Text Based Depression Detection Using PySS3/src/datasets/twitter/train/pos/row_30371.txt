How do I tell my mom, she broke my back? I was in a drunk driving  accident when I was 4 years old.  My mom was the one drinking. That was ten years for the doctor to notice something was off. Turns the out two bottom vertebrae are fused together and is  twisting my spine inward. By the time i'm 30 every step I take will be agonizing pain. She is 2 years sober now and I'm scared that one bad thing make he relapse . I don't know how to tell her.
