Hereâ€™s a funny classic story I tell to my friends from when I was at a party The guy goes â€œYou bastard! You betray me! You are not good, you are just a wimp!!! I'll get you, you just wait!! You chicken!!! CHIP!!! CHIP!!!! CHIP!!!! CHIP!!!!!â€

The other guy goes â€œYour ass is grass, and I'm the lawnmower!!! Go pee on an electric fence!!â€

Then the first guy says â€œRemember Mark!! He who laughs last, laughs last! So go ahead, I dare you to say something in reply to me! I double dare you!! But I know you won't because you're too afraid!!!â€

Classic story I tell to my friends many times
