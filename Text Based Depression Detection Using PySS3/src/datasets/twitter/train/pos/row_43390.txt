Dad threatening to hit u and ur sisters with an axe bcus ur not cleaning fast enough checkkk ðŸ˜œðŸ¤Ÿ Starting to think he's sexist? Oh also is that like abuse or something? He was always the type to throw shoes at us and hit us with a practice bamboo sword, but never something with a sharp edge that could quite literally kill us. He was just carrying it around and lightly swinging it tho. Prolly all bark and no bite but he was really waving that thing around, like ngl it was kinda scary
