So there's an anti-mask protest today in my city... And so many of the protesters are brandishing American flags, trump 2020 hats and signs.

Okay, let me make this clear: I live in Toronto, *Canada*. So, these are 'canadians' that are protesting against masks, vaccines and rallying for a politician who isn't even from our country and doesn't even like us ðŸ¤¨

My brain bleeds from trying to understand their logic, pls make them go away ðŸ˜¾
