I (18M) just broke up with my girlfriend (19F) and now she wonâ€™t leave my house because we â€œarenâ€™t broken upâ€ I just told my girlfriend that I am ending our relationship of 2 years and she is refusing to leave my house. Iâ€™ve been unhappy for quite some time but this is quite out of the blue for her. What do I need to do?
