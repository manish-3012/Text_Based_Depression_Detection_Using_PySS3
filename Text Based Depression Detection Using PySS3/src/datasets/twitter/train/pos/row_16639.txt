My family are big Piss Babies well, today my family is supposed to be going to a family gathering for Christmas at my aunts house. My aunt only asks for everyone to wear a mask for our safety especially during this pandemic but no my family (with the exclusion of me) wants to be a bunch of piss babies and throw a fit over having to wear a piece of cloth, key in im the wolf among the sheeple type shit i just hope im able to go because I really like to spend time down there with my cousin he is basically my best friend, and I'll be courteous and wear a mask just because I was asked to and so I can spend time with my extended family, if my family doesn't wanna go over a mask fine let them be children
