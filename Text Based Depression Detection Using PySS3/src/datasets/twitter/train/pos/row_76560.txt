So I recently watched all of My Little Pony friendship is magic. It's alright I guess. Like it's not amazing, all the characters are pretty bland, with a few being annoying beyond belief, but for the most part they aren't awful. A lot of the episodes were just kinda there and completely unmemorable. But like some of it was just dumb. Like there's the elements of Harmony which are all character traits, and then there's just magic for some reason. And Magic in the show is super inconsistent, like you can teleport sections of the earth anywhere, but you can't get some spilled stuff off of a tree? That's stupid. In season 8 the villain of the last episodes is just completely stupid, they had no prior motivation and just came out because the writers didn't know what to do. And the idea of there needing to be a friendship school is pretty dumb aswell. 

That being said I mean I never had to turn it off, it's not awful but it isn't great. It's just mediocre, good enough.for.goods to enjoy and parents to watch along without wanting to tear their eyes out.

Seriously though I need help, I sat through 9 seasons of this, it was too much for me ðŸ¤¢
I only did it to see if it was as good as I remember.it being when I was like 6 or 7 and I'm pretty disappointed in that regard

So I give it a 4.8 out of 10 for a young kids show
