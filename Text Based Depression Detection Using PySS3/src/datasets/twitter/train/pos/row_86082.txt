Whats the deal with bridal and bachelors doing stuff Im 16 and insecure as  f u c k. I saw some stories about a bachelor / bridal party, ect and the stri**ers. Don't get me wrong, they're nice: but isn't having a stripper tough you months or weeks from your wedding kinda messed up? Like, "I'm getting married let me get fucked by a random guy" like wtf.

I'm all down for like a dinner but to me strippers / performers is to far...
