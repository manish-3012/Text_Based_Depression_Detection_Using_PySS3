I miss having guy friends Yo honestly, I had guy friends my whole childhood, but mostly girl best friends, and now I've moved and have girl friends but I found out we dont share as many interests. It's hard because most boys my age I've met have a weird attitude towards women, either straight up sexist or "Nice guy" or just talking over and ignoring me. I also dont know how this friend thing works because I had the same friend group my whole life until I moved. I dont even know how to meet people outside of school. Also its a little hard being a girl and trying to find guy friends, because its hard to have an emotional connection and be affectionate to one another, and I think especially for guys because society holds them to such high standards regarding their emotions. I wish I could find guy friends, and someone who actually cares about me. Sorry for the rant, I just figure we're all teens and maybe someone knows sumn I dont.
