My Advice To You: Never Give Up &lt;3  No matter what happens in your life, never give up on your dreams and aspirations. Promise me that right here, right now.

I am not the most musical guy around. I sing like a harpooned whale and I can't play a single instrument in existence. But, I love music. It is truly what I am most passionate about in this lifetime. My aspiration in life was to be able to influence the music industry in some way, shape or form. How was I going to do this though? I tried a few things but nothing really worked out. But, was giving up on this goal an option? Hell no. I took it upon myself to start curating Spotify playlists. Using my in-depth music knowledge to make playlists for people to enjoy and discover songs on. I also became a music manager for one of my friends who is musically (inclined).

Did this work? Yes, yes it did. It worked out amazingly in my favour. I have spent months promoting my playlists and working with my friend on his music career. As of right now, my main playlist on Spotify has over 800 fans to it's name. And the artist I manage, well in five songs he has amassed over 200k streams.

Why do I share all of this? I want to show you guys why you should not give up. If you are passionate about something but can't do it directly, find a way around it. There is always a way to make something work if you put enough effort into it.

That is my Ted Talk.
