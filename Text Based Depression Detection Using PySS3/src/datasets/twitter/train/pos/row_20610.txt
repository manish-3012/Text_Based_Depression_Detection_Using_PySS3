Itâ€™s obvious my little brother is my momâ€™s favorite and damn it hurts. Itâ€™s completely obvious. For starters, I was payed for. When I say that, I mean my parents thought one of them was infertile. So, I was â€œmadeâ€ as my mom says. 2 months later, my momâ€™s pregnant again, without the help of a doctor, meaning they could have had a kid all along. That kid is my little brother.

We grew up in a pretty bad environment. Our parents fought, we were poor, we lived with 4 other people in a 2 bedroom house, one of them was a drunkard, one was banging the drunkard (They were first cousins), one was my grandma with dementia, and the final one was my bitch of a Great Grandma. After we moved out of there, it was a constant financial battle with us going from 5 in a 3 bedroom apt (Grandma came with us), to a 5 in 2. 

We were also spoiled to high hell. We (most of the time) got what we wanted and got stuff even when we didnâ€™t ask. At first, I was kinda spoilt. Sometimes, I wouldnâ€™t get my own drinks unless told to, and Iâ€™d procrastinate doing chores. I eventually grew out of it, but not my brother. He was worse. Lately, heâ€™s gotten better; but before this, heâ€™d call everyone assholes if he didnâ€™t get what he asked for, when we didnâ€™t get him his lunch (Which was very basic and needed no effort whatsoever) he wouldnâ€™t eat, and worst of all, when he was annoying me and I asked him to stop, he wouldnâ€™t. So Iâ€™d ask him again and again until I had to yell or push him off me. Heâ€™d proceed to call me names under his breath but juuusst loud enough for me to hear him, heâ€™d be passive aggressive all day, and somehow even worse, my mother would SUPPORT THIS BEHAVIOR! If he ever got really mad, sheâ€™d offer to take him shopping and usually come back with a coke. On the off chance, heâ€™d be poking at me or something and Iâ€™d ask him to stop. My mom would come in and ask ME to leave. I would be talking with my friends on discord and sheâ€™d tell ME to leave? Today, I was playing Xbox with my friends when something scared me, and I gasped. When I was talking to my friends about it, he cut me off and started trying to get my attention about something. After I didnâ€™t reply, he got really bitchy and threw shit at me. My mom came in and asked me to leave, despite the fact *He* was overreacting. Make him leave! When I donâ€™t defend myself, and tell my parents, he keeps pushing my stuff on the floor on purpose saying â€œoopsâ€. If I tell them again, either my mom offers to take my brother to go get a cookie, basically rewarding him, or I get told that *Iâ€™m* wrong.

Iâ€™ve supported her lots. Iâ€™d helped her through her backpain caused by an car accident by massaging her back and making it feel better. Iâ€™d hand her water and tell her itâ€™ll be alright after fights with my dad, even though I was holding back tears of my own because of what was happening. We only fight once in a full moon, and even then they werenâ€™t very bad. When we do fight, sheâ€™s 50% of the time completely wrong. Sheâ€™d never apologized about that.

Now, my brother on the other hand, treats her like shit. He yells at her, hit her one time, demands her around, and doesnâ€™t even try to acknowledge the fact that heâ€™s her son. It angers me that she lets him get away with this. 

Sorry for the extremely long post, itâ€™s just that I have a lot to unload after thinking about this for 3 years.
