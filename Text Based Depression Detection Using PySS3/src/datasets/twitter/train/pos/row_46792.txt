Is it okay to tell someone what's wrong with them? Kind of a rant. Anyway, so this guy I was in a group chat with, and my bestfriend was in it too. This just happened btw. So, we were talking about people would care if we died or not. I'm not a very social person, (I'm not suicidal, and neither are they. It was just a general discussion) so I said it would only affect my family. And this guy who used to be my other best friend, says and I quote, "If you were more social, then you wouldn't have this problem" and goes on to tell me what's wrong with me. So I told him, "you are so right! Why dont I just step out of my comfort zone and talk to a complete stranger? How dense can I be?" And he responded,  "EXTREMELY". Did I overreact by leaving the group chat and telling him to go do something to himself?
