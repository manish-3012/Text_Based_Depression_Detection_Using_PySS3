I Have A Quick Math Question 
(Math 11) (Pre-Calculus) 

I need to write the range of a parabola. Itâ€™s goes up forever. How would I write that. I know you can do it. Iâ€™m not sure how though.

Is it 0 &lt;_ (idk what goes here)

Any help would be appreciated. I know you can do it. Iâ€™m not sure what it looks like. I forgot.
