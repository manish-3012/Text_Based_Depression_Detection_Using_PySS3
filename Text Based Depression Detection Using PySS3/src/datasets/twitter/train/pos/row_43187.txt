Just my personal opinion about masks. Read the whole thing before downvoting Ahh masks...

I hate fucking wearing masks-they're annoying as hell, especially during school. We have to wear them the whole day. But, we're allowed to temporarily remove them for like however long it takes to take a sip of water (Gotta hydrate) and when we eat lunch. It's very nice that they don't make us wear them while eating lmao that would be gross

We have to social distance at school the entire time, except when we're walking in the hallway haha. I do it and try not to complain a whole lot but it is more difficult to breathe (whatever I'll survive)

To be honest, I'm not sure how much they work, but I am certainly gonna wear them, especially when it's a requirement. I haven't seen really anyone refusing to wear masks, but some classmates let it fall under their nose, which really defeats the whole purpose, idiots.

So yeah just my two cents. Wear masks for the time being, people. We all know how annoying those little shits are, hopefully the pandemic will end soon.
