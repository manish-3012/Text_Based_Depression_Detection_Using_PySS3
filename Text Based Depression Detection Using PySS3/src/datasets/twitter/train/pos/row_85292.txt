A Update, about things i wrote earlier here I don't mean the things like the present for my teacher, or these i think two memes. I now write about the situation with my crush. So i think the last post about her was that she rejected me. Short after that i was 2 weeks in Qurantine. But i don't "gave up" because, when she doesn't like me, i accept that, but still I think she is a cool person that's why i want to become friends with her. Sometimes i treat her like one of the dudes, or ask her something, on WhatsApp and in Person. And it has nothing to do with that, but in last time, i talked a bit more often with her Stepbrother, they are in the same class. This are not really news, but i wanted to share my life with Reddit, once again
