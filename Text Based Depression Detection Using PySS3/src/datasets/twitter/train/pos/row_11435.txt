I hate some teachers. There's this teacher I got this year that is an absolute asshole,here's what happened: my dad had signs of a heart attack yesterday on Thanksgiving weekend(Canada) and I couldn't take a test for science.

(some info about the test: it was a unit test about 60 questions. that was meant for last week but I missed it because I had to get tested for covid, teacher said she would tell me when to retake it, she told me on Friday, "are you ready to take it?" Me not ready at all said I'll take it Tuesday after thanksgiving.)

Because my family was in the hospital (dad is fine) and it was a big thing I forgot about studying, also left my phone at the party, when I arrive at school the next day she goes on this rant how she had to arrive 25 minutes earlier so I could retake the test. And how I didn't tell her I wouldn't be coming, I told her the whole situation and she said I'll be getting a zero, and we'll talk later(failing the test would give me an F but getting decent grade on it would give me A) she said she's still thinking if I should be able to retake the test, I swear she has tried to fail me so many times just because, I don't like to put my hand up. This is the second time something like this happens. I don't know what to do guys and gals.

Sorry if this is hard to read just typed this up in the bathroom as fast as I could.
