Toradora was the best anime Iâ€™ve watched, but I didnâ€™t like the ending I think Another might actually be better but thatâ€™s like comparing apples and door knobs, there completely different and you canâ€™t really say a specific apple or door knob is better than the other unless thereâ€™s a significant difference in quality (remember licking door knobs is illegal on other planets)

, it was predictable and I saw it coming but I still hated it. He ended up with the tsundere and not the right choice, the really nice not tsundere girl. Honestly I think all three of them liked each other, she liked both of them (but him more so) he liked both of them (but the tsundere more so), and I think the tsundere liked him, I donâ€™t think she liked her

Why didnâ€™t he end up with Minori, sheâ€™s so much better
