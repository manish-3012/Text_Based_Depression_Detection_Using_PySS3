Posting here daily until I get a gf: Day 247 Today it hit me. For this whole time I've just thought that it would be funny if I reached a really big number, but I realized how much I want to stop. Not just for the inconvenience of posting these everyday, but for the fact of how much I want someone to hug, to cuddle, to watch movies together and to just spend time together. F I feel lonely again.
