Just burned the crap out of my phone's charging port. I'm a pixel 2 owner (woohoo stock android!) and was just charging my phone with a normal 2A charger and I smelled burning. Unplugged phone and the cable was charred and the phone no longer reports charging when it's plugged in and sees cables as "analog devices" aka headphones.

80%, people, is all I have left. RIP
