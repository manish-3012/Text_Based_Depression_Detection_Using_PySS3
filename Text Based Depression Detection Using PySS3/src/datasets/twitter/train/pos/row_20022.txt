What are your favourite songs and the Moments that made them? So as part of the D&amp;AD, Spotify Design Brief I created a feature called Spotify Moments. Spotify Moments is a new way to connect with friends and family by sharing the songs that mean the most to you and the moments that made them.

Essentially the heart of this idea is that we all have a connection to certain songs more than others. Certain songs have emotional links to places, people and different times in our lives. So with Spotify Moments you can scan these Spotify codes (Stickers, wall prints or whatever other format they can be displayed in) that would be located around these hotspots/locations or scan for local areas of interests in your city and you can access a feed of user shared images, songs and experiences they have linked to that place and song. Youâ€™d be able to read up on other peopleâ€™s stories who have had similar experiences as yourself, discover new music that way and also contribute and share your experiences with certain songs and places and tell the world what a song means to you.

I'm currently building the final prototype and need some personal stories I can populate the prototype with. I'd love to hear your story about why a certain song has a special place in your heart, whether that be because it reminds you of a loved one, takes you back to better time in the past or jus feels right to listen to when you're at a certain place
