HELP. My mom I so easily gullible My mom is from a African country and only watches African content which is obviously fake.

There was a story where a woman when to a job interview. She left her phone on the counter FOR 2 SECOND and she got hacked (first red flag) basically the story goes she went for a interview and got 4k as "down payment " mind you this is labor work. She gets home and evey electronics her phone touches becomes a bug EVEN THE MICROWAVE (flag 2) then she takes her kids to school and before she gets there a white van kidnaps her and then they steal her and her kids kidney. This last part might be believable but there was no proof where I researched .

When I asked my mom about that she says that the when the women noticed that her kidney was gone she call 911. The police came and killed the women and child(biggest flag of them all)

Here's the question I asked to my mom

Are u sure this is real
Yes

Why did she accept 4k from a shady labor employee 
Idk

Phones cant be hacked into so easy you know that right?
You dont know what they can do with tech from the black market.

(Repectfuly) how in the fuckry did this guy on the screen know every detail of this story and isn't related in any way (in the story it is said that she has no family except for the kids)

Tldr; my mom is very ignorant
