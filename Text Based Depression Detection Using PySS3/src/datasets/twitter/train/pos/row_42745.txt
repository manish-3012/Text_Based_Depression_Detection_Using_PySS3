If you don't want to go to something, just be honest and say that. I got invited to a bondfire with people that I don't really feel like hanging out with, so I declined the offer to go by saying I was going to one of my other friends houses that night.
Well now they cancelled the campfire because of rain and rescheduled to a different day. I shouldn't have come up with an excuse in the first place. I should have just been HONEST and told them I didn't want to go. Now I need to come up with a way to get out of this again :/
