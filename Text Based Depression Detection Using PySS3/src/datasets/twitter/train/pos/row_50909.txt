Iâ€™m pretty sure one of my â€œfriendsâ€ is making me be unhealthy She and I have very different beliefs, and she always puts me down. Whenever one of my actual friends and I try to talk about things that doesnâ€™t fit under her â€œgood personâ€ radar, she finds something to make us stop talking about it. For example, he and I make jokes about sensitive topics. We understand them and know about them a lot, so we poke fun at them and make ourselves laugh. She says that â€œif you havenâ€™t experienced it, you canâ€™t make fun of it.â€ She always tries to drag our fun down and makes her own jokes about homophobia and transphobia but says itâ€™s ok b/c sheâ€™s non-binary. Also, she always tries to put me down. Iâ€™m not narcissistic, but I generally think Iâ€™m a cool guy to hang around with. But whenever sheâ€™s around, she always makes me feel bad about myself. She calls me a hopeless virgin, a misogynistic incel, and someone who doesnâ€™t understand politics. I try to argue, but she just keeps saying the same things. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m misogynistic, and I believe in gender equality, and I donâ€™t understand politics because I think theyâ€™re stupid. My final question is, do I try to stop interacting with her?
