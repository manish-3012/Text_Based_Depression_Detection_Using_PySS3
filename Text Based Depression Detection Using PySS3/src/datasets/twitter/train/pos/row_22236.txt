Almost socialized today After a "class" today (really an extracurricular class) my instructor said that we got popsicles and could go outside and eat them and chat and whatever. I hung around for a bit but I didn't really talk to anyone. I don't know anybody there and I didn't want to just butt in without really knowing what to say. Closest I got was when the instructor asked if I wanted another and I said I was good since my hands were already a mess from the one I had.

Idk what to do though. I want to be able to make more friends and talk to people but when I actually can it ends up being like this where I just end up awkwardly hanging around within the vicinity without really going over and doing anything. How do I actually do something
