Iâ€™m angry and hurt My cousins came over today and we all decided to play some mortal kombat, we were all taking turns and the ones who werenâ€™t playing were eating snacks and generally hanging out. And in comes this asshole who just got done eating hot Cheetos, doesnâ€™t even semi whip his fingers or even bother to lick off the dust. Like an animal just ravaged my controller. We all get mad at him and he has the audacity to run off and tell on us. And heâ€™s 14. And now Iâ€™m in trouble for being mean, why.
