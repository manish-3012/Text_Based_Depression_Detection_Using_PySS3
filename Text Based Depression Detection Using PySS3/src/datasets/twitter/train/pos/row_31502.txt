My Great Grandma Was a Badass! Hey r/teenagers! I'm relatively new here so I should probably let you peeps know some stuff about me. I'm 17 \[F\] and am a practicing and proud Jew! My great grandma was a holocaust survivor and she passed away in 2018. She was a warrior and a fighter, she never gave up. I specifically remember one of the last things she said to me was that "our" "president" Mr. youknowwho Drumph is the closest thing to a modern day Hitler since, well yaknow, Hitler. She was the smartest person I knew, I miss her and I will always remember the things she went through and the things she taught me. Fly high Gammy.
