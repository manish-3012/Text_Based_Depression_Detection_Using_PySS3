Yeah so class was fucking weird today I was talking to this girl about how another guy jokingly said he was into her (it was an obvious joke, he went down in his knees and everything) and this one guy just shouts out of the corner "(name), i have a crush on you". So we both start laughing  a  l o t bcs we thought it was a joke. 
But now that i think bout it i doubt it was a joke.
He kept silent for the rest of the class. Also I've seen him staring at her back and told her about it. 

What do you think? He wouldn't have literally screamed, right?
