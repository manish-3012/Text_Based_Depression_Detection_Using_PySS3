What should I do? I'm currently in spring break, stuck at home as we all are. No one in my family is free and my friends are out of state. I *can* drive, but don't know where I'd go. 

My room is clean, and it is raining outside. I do not have any video game systems (nor do I enjoy games).

So far all I've done is clean and watch tv, but I running out of things to clean and shows to watch.

Do any of y'all have an idea of what I should do for the next 10 days?
