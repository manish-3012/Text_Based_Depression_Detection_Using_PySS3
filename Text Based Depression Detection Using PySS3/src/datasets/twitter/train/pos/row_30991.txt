As a Christian some older people in the religion make me cringe Like what the fuck happened to â€œlove thy neighbourâ€ and â€œjudge and you will be judgedâ€.

Plus itâ€™s a bit extreme to follow every single thing a 2000 year old book says in your daily life.

I apologize for all christians who are decent human beings about these people.
