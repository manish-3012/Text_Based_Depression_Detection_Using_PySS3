Ok quick story Ok so I got back from the sports carnival (basically it's what it says a day no work and do sports all day) I was selling stuff for cancer research and a dude in grade 7 came up to me and ask if he could trade something for it I said depends and he decided it was smart it show a 13yr girl the comdoms he's been hiding in his pocket for god knows how long. Worst thing was that they were used.. he has now been expelled from my schools and any school in my town (it's a really small town with like 2 maybe 3 schools).
