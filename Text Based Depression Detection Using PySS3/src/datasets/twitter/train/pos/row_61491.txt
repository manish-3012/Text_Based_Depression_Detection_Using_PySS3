Mom why are you such a hypocrite? You hate when people have opinions about your personal life, but then you on and on talking about how my cousin only has kids to not have to work, and have everything handed to her, yet if I say you shouldnâ€™t get mad at your sister for showing human emotion you yell at me saying I donâ€™t know the whole situation. Also why canâ€™t you just admit your wrong? Thereâ€™s a reason why I donâ€™t talk to you for more than 10 minutes, because I canâ€™t be around you for over 10 minutes without you getting mad at something I say. I could say I am stressed and you will say I barely do any school work so how could I be stressed. Maybe if you actually listened to me for once you would understand why. And why do you say that I act like I know everything, but your talking about plane crashes like youâ€™re a aerodynamic major. I am literally the one going to flight school.

Sorry for the rant, will probably delete in like 20 minutes please ignore it.
