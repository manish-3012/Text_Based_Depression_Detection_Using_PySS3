Things are getting old People who make content are real heroâ€™s. But people who use others content for their own â€œfameâ€ is kinda boring. Like YouTube channels that put memes into videos, or the same thing with a different side dish. It gets old seeing the same cliche in movies aswell and just like memes, when you all use the same formst and template itâ€™s boring. So please come together and stop reposting, especially on r/memes
