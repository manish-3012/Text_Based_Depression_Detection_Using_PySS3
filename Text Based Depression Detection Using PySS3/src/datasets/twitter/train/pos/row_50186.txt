any advice Ive gone through a pretty rough patch in my life to there point where I wouldnâ€™t be here today if it werenâ€™t for a few close friends. I have been feeling 10x better and have been for a few months now. but it feels like its going downhill again. feeling super stressed everyday and I cant catch a break. I try to take a break from school and end up failing all my tests. Is there any way to deal with this or even medication because falling back down terrifies me. It gets to the point where I lay in bed for a minimum of an hour and a half of my mind racing and to the point where I cant breathe or focus on one thing at a time.
