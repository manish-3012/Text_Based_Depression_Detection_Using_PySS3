I do not like America that much tbh I don't like their accent and like how they talk that much. They kind of sound a weird and awkward. I like some of their slang but some of it is not good like chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± and dude. I like some of the slang their rappers use a lot tho so that's good. Also I don't know why they don't like sports that much, like in my school nearly every boy plays like football or rugby or whatever and like 40% of the girls. I think it's cause they don't have good access to sporting facilities and stuff like that or it's just some areas but idk. Also I don't like the 2 party system that much.
