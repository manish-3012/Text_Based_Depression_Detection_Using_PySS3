We are the worst humans, ever. By the title I mean â€œweâ€ as teenagers. It may be social media, it might be more openness to alternative lifestyles, or it could be dem dirty democrats, but I just feel like we as teenagers are the worst. This week, (Iâ€™m a freshman btw) Iâ€™ve seen people vaping during class, prank calling the suicide hotline, witnessed a possible drug deal, and people openingly saying the N word. Also, thereâ€™s an excessive amount of piercings (both genders) and oddly mullets. Everybody listens to nothing but rap music and are always on their phones. They always say we are the future, and if this is it, the future is fucked. And itâ€™s not like I live in the ghetto, weâ€™re all mid to high class! People just enjoy being pieces of shit! What Iâ€™m trying to get across poorly is that we are fucked and society needs to get its shit together and find its morals before society becomes this.
