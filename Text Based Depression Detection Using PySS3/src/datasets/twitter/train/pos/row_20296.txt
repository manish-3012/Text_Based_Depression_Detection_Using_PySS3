Not all cops are bad/bastards 
I might get downvoted to hell, but hear me out, yeah I know about how many cops killed innocent people, and I agree, lots of cops arenâ€™t doing their job, but there is COPS THAT DO THEIR JOB, and when you say â€œACABâ€ youâ€™re saying Every COP known to humankind, stop generalizing, and thatâ€™s plain out ridiculous, there is a bunch of cops that are cool and nice, youâ€™ve just never saw it, and if we fire all cops, who will we call for an emergency, and you want the world to be in complete anarchy and high in crime rates making it ridiculous, they are many cops that risked their lives and/or got killed, and theyâ€™re bad? grow the fuck up, call me a white supremacist all you want, boo fucking hoo.
