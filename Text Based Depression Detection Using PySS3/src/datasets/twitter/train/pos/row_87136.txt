Am I too needy for wishing my friends and I would hang out more? We only go to the discord voice chat like once or (if lucky) twice a week, and this is not socially fulfilling for me. My best friend almost never even joins to talk and seems to talk most with her other friend, which makes me feel left out and unwanted. I don't directly express my social dissatisfaction, only hinting at it through asking if anyone would like to join the voice channel. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Why is no one else seemingly as eager to socialize? Discord is the only way I can socialize. Oof, I am nonsensically rambling a lot. Maybe I should get a journal like that one person said on a previous post of mine.
