Made a fake currency for a school project lol, how's it sound? The currency on Konstgjord comes in very large denominations. Each piece of currency is a small animal or other figure carved out of an uncommon or semiprecious type of stone. There are onyx, marble, hecatolite(moonstone), jet, and hematite figures. Instead of value compared to US currency, I will represent its value in comparison to income over time. The darker the stone, the more valuable the currency is, with the exception of moonstone. Marble figures are about a weekâ€™s worth of income, jet one month, obsidian three months, onyx six months, and moonstone one year. 

Goods are usually traded in large amounts. Instead of buying milk every month, youâ€™d buy a cow with a few marble figurines. Instead of taking out a loan, youâ€™d buy a house with 1 or 2 moonstone figurines.

The artisans that make the figurines are few and far between, but because of the relatively low volume of currency that needs to be in circulation, there has not been a need for more artisans

in the recent past.
