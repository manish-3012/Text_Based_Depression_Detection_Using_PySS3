Dear u/mapmanmap1 I saw your post about the tiktok girls you know. In the comments of said post, some name u/Fuse_Helium-3 said that some people say "they dont speak mexican" Fuse, why must you give me Vietnam flashbacks to the time my teacher told the Spanish kid in class she doesn't speak Mexican. We were in 3rd fucking grade. YOU DON'T TELL EIGHT YEAROLDS YOU DONT SPEAK A LANGUAGE THAT DOES NOT EXIST AND IS LITERALLY SPANISH BUT YOU THINK SPANISH COMES FROM MEXICO SO YOU CALL IT MEXICAN. why did you do this im gonna have bad dreams bye
