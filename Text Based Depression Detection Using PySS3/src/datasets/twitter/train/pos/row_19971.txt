I explained the whole lore of "gayn*ggers from outer space" to a female classmate at 2 am accidentally I was just fucking around at discord doing nothing and I got bored so I looked up my friend list to see if anyone was active so I could maybe dm them and talk about random stuff. I saw an account that I couldnt recognize (she changed her account details a day or so before that) and dm'ed her. We chatted about random shit for a bit and then the topic of the last movie I watched was brought up. After some digging I remembered [this masterpiece](https://youtu.be/soXkFMO4ixI) was the last movie I ever watched so I sent it to her. She found it funny and I thought it was a good idea to explain how homosexual aliens killed all women on earth to make everyone gay to save the planet to her because frankly I was too sleepy to think about it beforehand. I explained every single detail of the movie to her for about 25 or so minutes and then I decided to check our message history and found out she was not an ordinary online friend but an irl classmate. Fuck.
