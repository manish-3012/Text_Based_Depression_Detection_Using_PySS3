How to cope with the lack of exercice after an operation ? 
So I had a surgery for my appendix a week ago and in about a month I'll have another one for an hernia at the same place. The abdominal belt being a main muscle I am going to be prohibited from any sport for a total of 2 months. 

The thing is I started to workout about a year ago and it was a super boost for my mental health. It was kind of a ritual that meant I was still able to push myself and I was happy with the results. 

Now not doing any of this, being forced not to do anything more than just walking and feeling all I had gained through hard work fives times a week just quickly disappear is driving me insane. I'm talking to the point where I'm losing sleep over it, as I don't want to fall back to where/who I was before.

Does any of you know how I'm supposed to handle this ? Thanks a lot and sorry for the typos, I'm not a native english speaker.
