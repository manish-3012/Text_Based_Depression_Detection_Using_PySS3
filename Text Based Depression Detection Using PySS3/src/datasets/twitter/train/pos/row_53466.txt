This is awkward So umm a female classmate came to my house and I know nothing about her,and the first thing she do when sheâ€™s in our house is do homework,so I enter the room and play the switch,but Iâ€™m scared that she thinks itâ€™s impolite to do that,and I rlly. Donâ€™t feel comfortable and we havenâ€™t said a single word,I dunno what to do now
