why canâ€™t i get some damn privacy iâ€™ve never had a door. the closest thing iâ€™ve had was a curtain that went in the door frame. even that was taken away from me after a week because i kept closing it. every single year for my birthday i ask for a door.

it was my birthday yesterday and my parents finally agreed to get me a door. i was ecstatic. until i saw the door. it doesnâ€™t have a lock and itâ€™s SEE THROUGH. ITâ€™S CLEAR. they even made me promise i would keep it open for most of the day. 

i just want a door.
