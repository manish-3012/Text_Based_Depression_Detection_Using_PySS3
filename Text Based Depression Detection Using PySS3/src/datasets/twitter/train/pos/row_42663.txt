I need some help So Iâ€™ve been with my current gf for not too long now, only about 3 months. But for a while Iâ€™ve been feeling uneasy in the relationship. Itâ€™s more of a drain on me then anything at this point. I think we both jumped the gun on this one because we kinda skipped the small talk. I know I kind of fucked up by allowing it to happen but now Iâ€™m regretting it. We share almost nothing in common. Conversations donâ€™t really go anywhere. I feel more single than I do taken at this point. Iâ€™m sure some of you are asking â€œWhy donâ€™t you just break up with her?â€ Because she has really bad depression and really clingy. She tried doing *it* more than two times in the times Iâ€™ve been dating her.(also itâ€™s noteworthy she flat out refuses to even try and get help) I feel as if Iâ€™m tethered to her and Iâ€™m just not happy. So if I decide to cut the cord am I the biggest douche canoe on the earth? And how can I attempt to go through with this without triggering her? Idk how Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I have to resort to Reddit about my personal grievances but fuck it. Iâ€™d appreciate some second opinions .
