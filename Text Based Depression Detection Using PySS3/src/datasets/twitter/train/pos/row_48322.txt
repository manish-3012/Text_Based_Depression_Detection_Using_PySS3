basically my standards for a girl they gotta make the first move no hint dropping no bullshit none of that. They also gotta let me cry into their lap after a hard day and I want her to hug me tight while we watch anime. As for looks? Eh I'm not super picky I know what I like and don't like. So any members of the female persuasion be avoiding the horny boys on this sub take my advice at least for me hint dropping is stupid go head on I say especially since I can't talk to girls without having an anxiety attack and dying. No before you ask this isn't me lookin for a girl lol I already know I'm a repulsive fuck undeserving of any form of affection.
