Explain this pls Ok so basically, we were watching a film in class, then we had to answer some questions, and we also had to be in groups. So all of my friends were in groups, except for one witch I partnered up with, and there was a group which had 4 kids (3 kids max.) So they legit rock paper scissored to see who would come to our group (I guess that's ok?), and then someone said "good luck" and " oh god" like how am I supposed to feel? Maybe I'm overreacting pls tell me.

(English is not my first language pls chill if I made some grammar mistakes)
