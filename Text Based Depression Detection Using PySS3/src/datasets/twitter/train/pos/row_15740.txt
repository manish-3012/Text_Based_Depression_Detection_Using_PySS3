My sister just tried to argue with me that South Africans are not African Idk what she's talking about because they live in the continent of Africa she was trying to say they're not Africans they're South Africans and I said that's like saying they're not Asian they're Japanese which both are true they are Asian and Japanese much like they are South African and African
