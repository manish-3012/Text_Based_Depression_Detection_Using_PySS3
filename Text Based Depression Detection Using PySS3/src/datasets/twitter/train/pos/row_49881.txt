im new to cyberpunk 2077 and im looking to rank up my street cred so i can buy the legendary katana from coach fred how should i grind for the money and streetcred without glitches for reference i am using a katana based bleed build that has a 50 percent bleed chance and i get 14 percent health any time i apply bleed or hit a target affected by it so close quarters combat is my strongsuit. i also have a very strong rifle tho
