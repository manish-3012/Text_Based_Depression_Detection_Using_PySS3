My mom finally looked at the YouTube videos Iâ€™ve been making For the past 9 months, Iâ€™ve been making YouTube content as a hobby, and I was hoping to find a place to post some of my antics and practice editing! Iâ€™ve had a buddy help me make a few but my mom never seemed to care. My dad thought they were cool but I never knew what mom thought of it. I tried showing it but she thought it was a waste of time and thought I needed to focus more on finding what to do after school. BUT Iâ€™ve finally gotten my mom to watch it! After 3 months I finally got her to watch my videos, she thought they were alright and it was really nice to see her chuckle!
