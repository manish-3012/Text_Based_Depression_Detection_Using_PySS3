Why wonâ€™t Schoology let me delete submissions??!! I know Iâ€™m not the only person that has to use schoology for school now and Iâ€™m genuinely very stressed out about this. I had to record a video of me playing my violin for orchestra so usually what I do is record the part multiple times on one video then crop it down but for some dumb reason when I submitted the cropped video to Schoology it uploaded the whole 3 minutes of me redoing the part till I got it right and muttering words like â€œfuck thisâ€ under my breath. Iâ€™m mortified, the best part is that I canâ€™t find a way to delete it OMFG IM READY TO HURL MYSELF OFF A BRIDGE. I wrote a comment that said â€œplease do not watch this oneâ€. Rip my first chair spot pray for me please
