My life has changed forever Wednesday afternoon, driving for work. Stopped at a red light, gray truck pulls up next to me. Cute girl is all waving at me n shit. I roll my window down, and so does she. I wave, and she says hi. Then the light turns green, and we go our separate ways.

The way that made me feel was indescribable. I felt this happy feeling for hours. I laid awake in bed all night just thinking about that moment. A girl fucking said hi to me!!!!!

No, she didn't mistake me for anybody else, I drive a **very** distinct car. No, she wouldnt have recognized me. I moved states after graduating high school.
