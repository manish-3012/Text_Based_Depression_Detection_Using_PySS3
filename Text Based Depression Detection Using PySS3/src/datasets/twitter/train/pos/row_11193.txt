Just watched monster hunter Its humor was poor (mostly reliant upon slapstick) the script was pale at best the sound effect system was given far to much budget but it had an amazing plot but was over stocked of cliche moments and not even the good kind just the kind of

Oh theyre safe lets kill some people to make them relize that they are in fact not safe

And I dont care how strong your "ALL NATURAL ARMOR" is you WILL not be able to withstand constant .50 cal machine fire from all different angles and treat it as a minor annoyance and shrug them off and go tetering to each person one by one

And then there's the timing and the military formations

Screw it I can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie so watch for yourselves but this is just my two cents
