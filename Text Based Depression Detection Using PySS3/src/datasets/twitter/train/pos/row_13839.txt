I donâ€™t understand school uniforms I made a comment about this that people seemed to hate but I donâ€™t understand why people like school uniforms. Wouldnâ€™t you rather run the risk to be yourself then to worry about bullying. There are bullyâ€™s every where In real life  but there things you can do to stop some of them like reporting them to HR. Also wouldnâ€™t you rather have the schools take bullying seriously instead to just make you all the same. If you can afford a school with uniforms you could probably afford to have a style. I know you can do this outside of school too but why should I have to sacrifice my own identity for 6 hours a day. I feel like itâ€™s anti risk taking sentiment that will be in your head for life. Please explain because I genuinely donâ€™t understand. Also the down votes proof my point that now you canâ€™t handle someone criticizing you or â€œ bullyingâ€
