I kissed a girl I fucking did it!

A couple of weeks ago I was only dreaming about even meeting my crush outside the school let alone have physical contact with her. Last weekend she came over and we had a great time talking. When she was leaving  I had the best hug I've had in years. Then it just happened and we kissed. I still can't fucking believe it happened and I'm waiting the next time so much.
