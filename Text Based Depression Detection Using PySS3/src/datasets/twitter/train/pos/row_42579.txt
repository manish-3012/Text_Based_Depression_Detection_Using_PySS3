Parents these days honestly make me wonder if their generation lost their brains back when they were younger Seriously, my mother expects me to know how to use an oven after never teaching me. It's stupid, I should be able to learn by now but whenever I ask for her to tell me what to do she always gets mad and tells me to go to my room and wait for her to do it and then gets mad the next time when I don't ask for help and have to resort to wikihow. Can parents actually teach their kids how to do things rather than expecting them to already know?
