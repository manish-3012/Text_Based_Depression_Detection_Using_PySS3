I feel like my teacher was expecting something along the lines of â€œI hate homework! Teachers suck!â€ And then I went and wrote about the misogyny behind forcing girls to wear skirts and the wider issues of having a gender-specific uniform  Also Iâ€™m new to the school and am currently attending online so I havenâ€™t even had to wear the uniform yet lmao
