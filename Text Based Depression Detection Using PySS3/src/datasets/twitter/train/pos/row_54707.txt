how do i feel more like a teenager?! okay so iâ€™m 16 and i have no life. iâ€™ve never drank alcohol or done drugs. my friends do, but my parents donâ€™t let me hang out with them because of covid. all i do is sit in my bedroom on my phone.
DOES ANYONE HAVE TIPS ON HOW TO FEEL MORE LIKE A TEENAGER?? like what are some things i can do now, instead of being in my room all the time, so that i can feel more normal, and more like a teenager?????
