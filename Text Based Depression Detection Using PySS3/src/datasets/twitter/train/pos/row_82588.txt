Can we just .. stop this? Like all of it As a female ,I would like to take the time to talk about the uneasy divide between guys rn and uh , PEOPLE .

First off I would like to address what a real feminist is (in my own words cuz ya :

A feminist: Someone who is protecting and active about the equality between men and women where it isnâ€™t so .

Example: The wage gap between men and women that does still somewhat exist is different areas 

A feminist is not : â€œALL MEN ARE PIGSâ€ â€œHATE MENâ€ â€œWERE GONNA WEAR VAGINA HATES AND SIMULATE CUTTING YOUR DICK OFFâ€

No, just no

An argument I see held against every day average guys is the body positivity thing . But oh so then when a guy spreads body positivity heâ€™s posing, and too confident. 

I guarantee you if you said infront of a bunch of normal dudes â€œall boobs are nice â€œ â€œwomen arenâ€™t objectsâ€ and â€œall bodies are beautifulâ€ 
Of course , people have preferences but a majority would agree . Just because youâ€™ve interacted with douche bags who think even a molecule of fat on your body is too much , is not every other guys problems .

Women , for the most part in these first world countries , where we are developed . WE ARE NOT OPPRESSED on a day to day basis okay girls? We really arenâ€™t that oppressed anymore . There will always be ass hole people who are racist sexist etc . 

I really hope some of these â€œfeministsâ€ start putting their effort into places like India and places where they may actually still be badly oppressed . And stop acting like guys are animals and they know everything about them , I donâ€™t care if your a psychologist with a masters degree . If they donâ€™t know everything about our bodies and minds , then neither do you about theirs . And maybe instead of being so negative , educate each other when we misunderstand something :)
