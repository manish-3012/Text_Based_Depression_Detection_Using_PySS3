Idk who needs to hear this but Every journey begins with a single step, for some that step is shaky and unsure, but is soon followed by another more confident step. For others they start strong but trip along the way, for some this happens hundreds of times. Whatâ€™s important is not end or how long it took to get there, but the fact that you took another step. Stay strong, I love you all
