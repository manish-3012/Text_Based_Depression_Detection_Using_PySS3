What's your opinion on abortion? **Disclaimer: I'm not in the USA and in my country abortion is illegal.**

In my opinion it should be legal and free *when* the baby or the mom are in risk of dying/having a bad life. It should also be legal when it was rape.

It should be illegal if the couple was irresponsible and didn't use condoms and now want to get rid of the baby.
