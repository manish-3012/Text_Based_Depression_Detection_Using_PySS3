Please tell me I'm not alone I hate it here. I hate school, I dont want to go back. The constant stress of trying not to fail. I'm on my junior year and I don't want to fail me exams because I need to make it out of this shithole city. The constant stress put on by my family to succeed, I never asked to be put in a position where I have to succeed. All my family is poor and I'm the only one that's made it to highschool, but I dont wanna be. I just wanna be a normal kid, but I cant cus I have to babysit my grandparents all day. I've been robbed of my childhood and I hate it here. Please whoever reads this, please succeed where I failed. Be better than me, be stronger, but I can't take it.
