I hope 2021 is better Last year my school closed down, it was the first school Iâ€™ve been to, that I actually had friends,  I had some of my favorite teachers there, at that school there were two teachers specifically that I absolutely loved they treated my class like actual people since we were in the lowest group,  one them was an older lady and was the kindest teacher Iâ€™ve ever met, the other was more like a mom to everyone she told us if we were fucking up and did her best to help us and made schedules and plans on how to bring our grades up. will miss them both.

I havenâ€™t seen any of my friends this entire year, I had plans to see my close friend who I havenâ€™t seen since eighth grade. Those were canceled the second the first quarantine happened.

My drug addict aunt is still M.I.A, my cousinâ€™s husband got deported 

Now Iâ€™m contemplating on going to school next school year or staying online, Iâ€™m a junior now  which means next year is my final year, so Iâ€™ve questioning on going to a school where I can possibly make some friends or stay online once whatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m going for one year.

I hope this year is better
