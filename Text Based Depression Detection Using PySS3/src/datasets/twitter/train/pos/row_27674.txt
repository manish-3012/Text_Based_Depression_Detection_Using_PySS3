i had the best dream i was adopting a really cute bulky st. bernard doggo from the RSPCA (for all you Americans basically and animal shelter) and his name was bernie and i woke up after my parents were driving me and bernie home but my dumbass brain was like "hehe bro this is real" and i thought my parents had actually let me get a st. bernard.

now im sad
