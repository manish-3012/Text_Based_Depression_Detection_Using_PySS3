I need motivation to do school I'm 15 with ADHD and learning disabilities, and I absolutely hate school (*although, don't we all?*). I got all F's in my classes because I refused to work. But now since I'm a sophomore this year, and there's a law called "*No child left behind*" or something, where a kid doesn't get held back and stuff. I want to do good this year, and graduate to get my degree and **not** do school over again when I'm an adult.
