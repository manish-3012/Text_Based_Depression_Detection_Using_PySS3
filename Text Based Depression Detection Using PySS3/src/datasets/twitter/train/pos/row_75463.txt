I got an serious Issue with postponing. Like Seriously. I know if I am going to write a Latin Test in 3 weeks I already know im going to do a bit last minute (like from 23:00 to 24:00) and then do nothing. (Thats how I got my last 5) Usually that's not a problem since im good enough in English, Maths etc. But especially Latin is just so much shit to learn.
