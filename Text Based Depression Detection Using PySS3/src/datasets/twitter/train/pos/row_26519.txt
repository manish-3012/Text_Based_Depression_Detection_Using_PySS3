man online school and family fucked me over hard i have ADHD, I can't focus on one thing for a long time, and the littlest things distract me, sadly my family doesn't understand this and forces me to work out in the active, loud, noisy living room all because I had one D that I was working on already, and by the time they made me work in the living room it was back to a B, they constantly baby me on every little thing in life and don't let me do things to help myself because 10 years old me would be bad at doing things on my own. I'm 16 now and they still baby me and I can't do anything about it because I have no authority in the house. now I have an f in class, and they tried to 'encourage' me to get a better grade by telling me they'd send me to military school if I didn't get a passing grade by the end of the semester, and now, its the end of the first semester and I have an F in English class, and I can't fix it anymore. So now i have to either find a way to prevent my family from seeing that I have an F or go to military school.
