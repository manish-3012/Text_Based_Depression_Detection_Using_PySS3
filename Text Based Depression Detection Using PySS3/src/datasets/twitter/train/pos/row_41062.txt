School election campaign videos are bad All of them are one of 3 things either the entire video is essentially them saying vote for me, they say something like iâ€™ll get things done (they wonâ€™t, thatâ€™s not how private schools work) or there essentially like my life is more interesting than yours I own a horse or I snowboard vote for me

Also one of them had an extremely low resolution web cam and the footage was stretched out to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio

Usually I would encourage you to vote but I donâ€™t think I will none of them gave any reason I should vote for them they were just like vote for me, k bye
