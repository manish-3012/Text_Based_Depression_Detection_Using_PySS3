People giving advice to help your mental health are annoying This might very well just be a small margin of people who feal this way. But i hate when people say "oh you can do it. It's gonna be okay. You are strong. Everything's going to be okay. You just have to try again"

And it's not as much about what they say but more about the idea that if every time you fell down you just HAVE to try again and have to keep fighting it always.

For me at least thats just plain wrong and is really annoying because "yes i have tried to fix my mental health for like 9 years i think and everytime it would be good for about 1/2 - 1 year and puff i gotta start over... From scratch... Again..."

And i have simply gave up now and accepted that this isn't worth it because everytime I got broken down i got weaker, not stronger.
And even when I fixed it i was scared of when it broke so instead of depression, grief and anxiety i just got worse anxiety.

Anyway my life's shit and i don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to  kill myself either so I guess imma just lay down.

Anyway thanks for reading my trash and have great night y'all be nice.

Ps.
I know they mean it well and i do love them for trying but they might not get that i might be a bit of a special case.
