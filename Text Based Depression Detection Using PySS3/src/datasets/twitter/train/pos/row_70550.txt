are we just gonna ignore that aliens are now basically confirmed? the ex israeli space head has confirmed that aliens exist, but are waiting until humanity is ready to fully grasp the idea of space and space ships. he says that they have a base at mars and that astronauts have also stepped foot on the red planet as well. the US and the Galactic Federation have an agreement to do experiments as well(iâ€™ll get into that later)

so i myself have been a firm believer that aliens exist. how can they not? space is infinite and there is so many planets out there and  at least 1 of them has to contain life. intelligent life is hard to come by, but still not rare at all if you take the whole infinite aspect of space into consideration. do i think weâ€™re ready to accept them? some of us. ofc thereâ€™s gonna be people against it and if you are some of those people, look at all the knowledge we can gain from this. this is a HUGE advancement for man kind

and the idea of them being able to interstellerly travel isnâ€™t as far fetched as you may seem. with our resources we have on earth, itâ€™s nearly impossible. but what about the resources in their home planet? didnâ€™t think abt that did ya.

and with the whole experimentation thing, idk how i feel about that. it can be good in the fact that we gain knowledge but itâ€™s also inhumane and thatâ€™s going to cause an uproar but i think itâ€™s a good thing. the fact that they are (seemingly) friendly is an amazing thing. they could probably easily wipe us out but they said they want our help.

this isnâ€™t the original story i read (i used apple news) but hereâ€™s something abt the whole thing right [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/im-a-space-alien-in-the-galactic-federation-its-really-boring-11607550675)
