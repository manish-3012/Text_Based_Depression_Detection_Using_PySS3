So i was wondering if some people can help me with this book im doing DISCLAIMER I MIGHT NOT RESPOND FOR A WHILE AND IM SORRY FOR THAT
well before you ask, the book is about a 13 year old named dasher who has a bond with a past brother named bullet in which bullet came to the future by finding a time machine to take him to the future.
Dasher on the other hand went to get gas as requested by his gfs mother and accidentaly sprayed the gas at himself while trying to turn it off. He swallowed the gas while bullet found dasher and done cpr and passed out as well. They both woken up in a hospital and discovered that they gotten supersonic speed and fire powers by burning the infinite oil source in his blood and can run like a car on gas but infinite and faster. Bullet on the other hand has ice power due to a reverse in his blood. They both discover that doctor ligma(or limpo) has come to the future and they must stop them along with the 2 robot replicas powered by the dash ruby.
Yet again im sorry if i cant respond. 
Any recommendations are highly appreciated. If theres any questions feel free to ask. Thanks so much for understanding and helping
