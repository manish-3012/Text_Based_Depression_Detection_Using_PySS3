I hate being scared to express who I am Iâ€™m a (obviously) closeted bisexual guy. My family is  accepting, and my mom and step dad know, as well as a few close friends. Iâ€™m pretty masculine and have a lot of straight male friends, so itâ€™s not really something people pick up or know at first glance. Iâ€™m aware that this problem is a lot worse for more feminine men and poc, and I want to help those people too, but Iâ€™m still worried to come out, you know? 

I donâ€™t want my friends to look at me differently, I donâ€™t want the boys at school to look at me differently, especially because I donâ€™t have a crush on any of them, and I donâ€™t want to be physically attacked. Kids at my school have shown that theyâ€™re clearly homophobic (as well as racist and islamaphobic, theyâ€™re basically assholes) so I know things will be rough, 

Anyways, Iâ€™m done ranting.
