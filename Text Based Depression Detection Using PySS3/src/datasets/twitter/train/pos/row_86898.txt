Curiosity kills the cat My runaway cat named Moose once said:

The saying thay goes 'curiosity kills the cat' is a conspiracy theory popularised by humans to validate their willful ignorance and proliferate their stupidity. That's why they think we're vessels for witches and devils and that's why they label dogs as 'best friends', not us, like we even want to be friends with morons. Dogs are dumb enough to learn their tricks and do their bidding. We're just indifferent, waiting for the collapse of their civilization that will be caused by themselves. Homo sapiens my ass, more like homo slut-iens.

Disclaimer: This post is not meant to trigger anyone. I just made this because lately this subreddit has just all been about gender slender, how guys are scum and how girls are mentally imbalanced or they're shit. I just want to get us to talk something different. It's okay if i didn't do it properly, but at least i tried.
