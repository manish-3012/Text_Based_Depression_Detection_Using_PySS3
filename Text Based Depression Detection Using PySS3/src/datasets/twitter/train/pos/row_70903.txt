Reminder not to self-diagnose yourself I've seen some of the personality tests on this sub and while they may be fun to take, it's important to remember that self-diagnosing can be both inaccurate and sometimes detrimental to your health! This goes for counting yourself as a psychopath, which is actually categorized as Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD).

If you do think you may have signs of ASPD, depression or anxiety disorder, seeking out professional advice would be your best avenue.
