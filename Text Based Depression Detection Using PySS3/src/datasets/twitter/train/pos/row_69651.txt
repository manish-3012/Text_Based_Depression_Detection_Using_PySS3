2020 wasn't so great I say this because is true. 2020 wasn't the year everyone thought it was gonna be.

 Now having said that, I am declaring 2021 to be my year. No matter what life throws at me I will attack back with double the ferocity! 2021 will not conquer me! Join me and declare 2021 as the year of good things!
