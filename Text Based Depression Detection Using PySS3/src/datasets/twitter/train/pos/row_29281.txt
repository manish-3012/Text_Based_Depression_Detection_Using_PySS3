(WARNING THIS POST IS GOING TO MAKE YOU MAD IF YOU ARE A WOMAN. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE PISSED LEAVE THE POST NOW) And the film dark fate John Connor dies at the beginning and it wasn't a t800 that killed him it was feminism. Edward furlong you know the man that played John Connor in the second film he was going to be in Terminator dark fate but then feminists got a hold of the plot and guess what they made the main character a girl they made the Terminator that's going to save her a girl. And they literally bought back Linda Hamilton which is fine by me cuz she was great in the first film and second film. And upsets me because this is what Hollywood is becoming. Did you notice how an end game they killed off Tony Stark and Captain America and now Tony Stark's going to be played by a female which is going to be his daughter and I'm just mad.
