i take so long to poop! 



not exactly, but everytime i go to shower, whether it be after a game, or just cause i feel like showering, i sit on the toilet, but naked, and scroll through my phone for about an hour. i didnâ€™t know it was possible to procrastinate when it comes to showers, but apparently it is. my whole family thinks iâ€™m mad constipated and need help, when really iâ€™m just wasting my life away on reddit. itâ€™s 6:47 and iâ€™m starting to get hungry. does this change the fact that i might move? absolutely not. who needs food? i feel so useless. anyone else?
