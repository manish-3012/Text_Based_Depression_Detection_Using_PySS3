So I just browsed through r/jesuschristreddit Sometimes I wish that I was born blind, fuck this shit I'm never gonna forget some things I saw there and in other similar subs today. Why I am I always curious about stuff i know are disgusting. 

Tldr:avoid that sub and other similar ones like the plague
