Fellas, I feel motivated Starting on September 9th, I've had an online music class in school for the first time. My teacher is so motivating and funny and happy, I wish I could be like him. He's inspired and motivated me to actually continue to learn guitar. He's so great and I'm so glad I have him as my teacher:)
