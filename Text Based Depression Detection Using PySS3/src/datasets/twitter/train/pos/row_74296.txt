Dang do compliments really mean so much to y'all? So, boys, gals, non-binary pals,

I've been seeing so many posts lately that were like "OH MY GOD A GIRL COMPLIMENTED ME!!" or "OH MY GOD MY CRUSH COMPLIMENTED ME!!". Does- does that really make people that happy? If so, I feel like I should be complimenting people more...
