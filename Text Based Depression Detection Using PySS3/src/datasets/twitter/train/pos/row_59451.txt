People always say â€œIt was Native American land first. Weâ€™re on stolen landâ€ Every single piece of land fucking EVER has been fought over. You know who got the land? Those that had a stronger military. The Americas are no different. Colonizers came to America and beat the natives because they severely outmatched their technology and warfare methods, and then took their land, which was just how it was at the time, with manifest destiny and everything. I mean bro look, they lost and we got their land, thatâ€™s the end of it.
