I HAVE TAKEN SOCIAL ANXIETY TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL I was infront of a girl in the hallway today and I looked behind me and I was like "oh shit" and I legit forgot how to fucking walk. I saw someone of the opposite sex near me and I forgot how to put one foot infront of the other. Damn it was so awkward just standing there, frozen, as I try to remember how to walk. She just passes me and gives me this look of "wtf is wrong with you"

I ask myself the same question
