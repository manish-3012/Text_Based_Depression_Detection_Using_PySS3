My crush is hitting on me, but has a gf. As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve read the title, I wonâ€™t restate it.

Hello! Iâ€™m SkinnyFrog, Iâ€™m male and straight (for those of you that needed to know.). I recently started crushing on this girl, letâ€™s call her Addison.

We started talking about a two weeks ago. Just recently, I asked her out. She said she had a gf and that she was sorry. Thatâ€™s where things started to get weird.

Addison started snapping me pictures of her, which is normal. But then it happened. She sent me a leg pic. Then, every time I had to go, sheâ€™d send me a sexy picture of her, captioned with crying emojis.

Anyone else think this is weird? Sorry for the long post ahead of time.
