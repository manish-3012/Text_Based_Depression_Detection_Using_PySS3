I think I low key might be starting to get depressed again Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty good the past couple months and Iâ€™ve done some things in my life that have made me feel like not a complete waste of space but tonight I just got the urge to put on Time by Hans Zimmer and kinda just stare into the darkness. Itâ€™s 12:30am idk whatâ€™s wrong with me, and this song makes me contemplate way too much
