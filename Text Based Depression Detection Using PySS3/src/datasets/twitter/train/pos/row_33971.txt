Time i hit a woman because she kept hitting me but everyone got mad. This was so unfair. So im a very strong guy. And i went to this playground while babysitting a kid. But then one of her friend hits me. Then i thought about gender equality and decided to hit her back (she was 2 years old). So i used all my strength and punched her in the face which launched her about 10 meters away. And then people got mad. Smh my head dude we live in a saucity.
