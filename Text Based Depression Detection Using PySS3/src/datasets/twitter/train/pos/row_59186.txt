Spreading God's word day 7 Ephesians 3 14-21
14Â For this reason I kneel before the Father,Â 15Â from whom every familyÂ in heaven and on earth derives its name.Â 16Â I pray that out of his glorious richesÂ he may strengthen you with powerÂ through his Spirit in your inner being,17Â so that Christ may dwell in your heartsÂ through faith. And I pray that you, being rootedÂ and established in love,Â 18Â may have power, together with all the Lordâ€™s holy people,Â to grasp how wide and long and high and deepÂ is the love of Christ,Â 19Â and to know this love that surpasses knowledgeâ€”that you may be filledÂ to the measure of all the fullness of God.
20Â Now to him who is ableÂ to do immeasurably more than all we askÂ or imagine, according to his powerÂ that is at work within us,Â 21Â to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
