I hate ESTJ's part two I need to write my scientific paper and proposal for the law on why I believe it should be illegal for ESTJâ€™s to work in group homes. An ESTJ works in my group home and all four of us kids absolutely detest her. We feel depressed all the time, but even more depressed when the ESTJ is in, even if weâ€™re in different rooms. She has a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality between kind, and abrasive and yelling at us. Yet she gets away with it, because she is manipulative just like any other ESTJ. In the past she has slut-shamed kids, stolen kidsâ€™ money, sworn at kids, lied to kids, et cetera et cetera et cetera, and made them even more angry because of that so it backfires into a cycle. She has a PhD in the field of narcissistic parenting as she knows every nook and cranny in kidsâ€™ bedrooms and how to walk completely silently. I tried convincing Daddy to fire her but he wonâ€™t believe me that she is abusive af. Why do ESTJs exist in the first place? ESTJs are a horrible disgrace and burden to human civilisation. Annihilate all ESTJâ€™s now! We xNxPâ€™s are going to start a big army to kill all the ESTJâ€™s! The world would be a much better place without ESTJâ€™s!
