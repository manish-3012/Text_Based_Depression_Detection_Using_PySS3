I found out my crush likes me. SPOILER!! Idk if she likes me now. 

Story time:

I was cleaning my phone and i saw a few messages from her and since hindsight is 20/20, i just read that she was being very flirtatious with me, and my dumbass thought she was being nice. 

So because i read a YSK about taking chances, iâ€™m gonna ask her what she thinks of me right now and wait for an answer. If itâ€™s gonna be cringy af then itâ€™s gonna suck. At least itâ€™ll  be funny in the future.
