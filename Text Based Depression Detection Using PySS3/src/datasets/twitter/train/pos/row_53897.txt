How do I stop dwelling on stuff so much? Over the course of the past few years, I've started seeing the true colours of my friends. One of my closest friends asked me where I got the idea of being "close friends" with her from, as she thought it was untrue. This kinda killed me inside. I've done a lot of thinking and I've realised a few things:

1. I as a person can't really make proper connections with people the way others can, meaning I don't have close friends or best friends at all, so I'm largely alone
2. My friends aren't as good as I made them out to be lmfao
3. Being alone does not mean you're lonely (stolen from Enola Holmes)

I know all of this stuff, but occasionally I think about these "friends" and I get upset or mad. So, how do I stop dwelling on this so much?
