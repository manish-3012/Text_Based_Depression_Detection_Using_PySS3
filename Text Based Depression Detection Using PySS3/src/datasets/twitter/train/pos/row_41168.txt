Life's very shitty at the moment. The past 4-5 days have been very shitty for me. I've been complaining about this girl named "Lorna" on here because she's been a \*piece of shite\* to me recently.

I posted on here last night saying I was going to end things with her and I did. I was very nice about it, I told her why I wanted to end things, I didn't just block her out of no where. Her message was very different towards me, she called me very rude things, she dug a knife in my heart. When I read the message I was hurt. I then said "Goodbye Lorna." because I just didnt want to talk to her after that. I was in my moms room so I couldnt really react how I normally would, I just shut down and started shaking alot. It was dark, my mom and I were watching a movie so she couldnt see me.

She messaged me again, she told me that she was sending nudes to other guys while we were talking. I never asked her for anything well because I didnt want them to be quite frank. Look at me, whatta guy. She then sent me a few more hurtful messages before blocking me. 

I feel fine while im typing this, I dont feel anything but disgust towards her. Sorry this is a long post, I just wanted to get my feelings out there I guess, make myself feel better.
