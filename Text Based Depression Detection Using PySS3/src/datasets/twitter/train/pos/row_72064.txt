For the Broken people Your not going to find someone broken on the outside, they have learned to hide it. Your only going to find someone broken when they speak. They must speak to you on a personal level. 

They will reminiscent about the past when things were "good". They are going to talk of dreams thet had with those they lost. They will break again when they are reminded of they person and if from a relationship, they will 100% believe they moved on from one mention of a name or one posted picture. 

They will be the happiest people and the most giving. the softest and the kindest and the one in any given relationship to try the hardest because they dont want to break again and dont want the other person broken. They will be scared when someone leaves and feel anxious when it is about to happen. Broken people are also scared to trust as they have lost people because of trust. 
If you meet one of these people, maybe be a little nicer or have a but more patience, they need it.
