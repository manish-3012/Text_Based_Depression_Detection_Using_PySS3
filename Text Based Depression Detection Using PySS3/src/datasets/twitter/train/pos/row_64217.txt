i'm fucking terrified right now so i sold this camcorder on ebay for $350 at which point the buyer received it and they said the mic didn't work

well okay, just return it and you'll get your money back

not how that went

they're demanding their money back, even though the way returns work on ebay is that ebay holds the funds until the item arrives back at my doorstep so that it's fair for everyone

they're demanding their money back. money i don't have because ebay is holding it.

please send help. i'm shaking and crying rn.
