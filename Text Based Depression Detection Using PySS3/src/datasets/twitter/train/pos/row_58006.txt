Hopeless about the future Sometimes I really hate being Gen Z. There is so much weâ€™ve inherited that the adults in the world seem to have dumped on us to fix. Take climate change. There is so much we have to *do* and *give up* just to not destroy our goddamn planet. Boomers donâ€™t even worry because theyâ€™ll be dead by then, but at least you have the legal power to **fucking change anything**! I canâ€™t fucking vote on anything!

And all the things Iâ€™ll have to change. They say you have to go vegan because itâ€™s the best diet to be eco friendly. But, 85% of the foods I like contain animal products, and everything vegan is usually so expensive. Food is one of the things that makes me happy, and giving up good food just makes me imagine a future where Iâ€™m sitting at a table with a salad topped with pine nuts, day after day after day.   
Iâ€˜m so scared for the future. All it seems to be is apocalypse and death. I canâ€™t imagine a world where I will never see my parents and my dogs again. I can just imagine crying over their graves, begging for them to come back. Every day there seems to be a new group being genocided and tortured in a far off country, and I canâ€™t do anything but spread awareness, but most of the people who follow me on social media are people without much income (minors). Every day, since Iâ€™m American, my president is ruining our relationships with other countries and turning over environmental policies and making us a laughingstock. Excuse me, Mr. President, I want people to want to help me when everything inevitably goes to shit instead of shun me for my countryâ€™s decisions against them. 

Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™m sick of people dying. Iâ€™m sick of people not wearing a mask. Iâ€™m sick of wars going on for such stupid things. Iâ€™m sick of racial and religion and gender genocide. Iâ€™m sick of being scared because I have a uterus. I donâ€™t want to be raped. Iâ€™m sick of being scared that my marriage rights could be taken away, just because I like other girls. Even though my family is solidly middle class and doing well because my dad is essential (heâ€™s a radio host),, the decision of some celebrity to do something sexual on TV or say something dumb about a company could plunge us down where we were when I was little, when both my parents were unemployed and there was a recession. I donâ€™t want to be killed by some crazy person in my school with an AR-16.
