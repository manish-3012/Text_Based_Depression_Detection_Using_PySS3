This Femboy Friday, I openly crossdressed for the time and everyone was so supportive :) (I was trying to post a picture but i kept getting an error message, so if anyone would like to see it just pm me)

I've always wanted to crossdress openly, so one of my friends gave me a skirt and some fishnets as a gift. And she was being really supportive and encouraged me to do it, so this Friday I decided to do it, and almost everyone was being really supportive and really nice about it, and I felt really good about myself, and I was genuinely happy :)
