Philisophical question Let's say you're in a dark room. You've always lived in the dark room. Your biggest fear in life is being stuck in the dark room forever. 

You find a door. 

You think that it's highly likely that that door will lead to something scarier than the dark room. Or it could lead to another dark room. Maybe there's nothing behind the door except a wall.

But maybe the door opens to a corridor, where you can find your way out of this place. But that corridor could also be a dead end.

Your hope is that the door leads somewhere nice. You won't know until you open the door and see what's beyond. 

But again, behind the door might be something worse than staying in the dark room.

There is no other door. If you open this door and find out that there is nothing better than the dark room, then you'll have to live without that hope, the endless possibility of what *could* have been behind the door. 

Do you open it?
