i havenâ€™t had a crush on someone in so long and itâ€™s pissing me off i feel so bored like i canâ€™t think of the last time i genuinely had feelings for someone irl

i dated 2 guys at my school and after each of those relationships i realized i didnâ€™t like either of them at all and idk why we even dated

ITS SO FRUSTRATING and iâ€™d get a girlfriend but the only girls i know that are into girls are in my friend group and iâ€™m not about to mess that up
