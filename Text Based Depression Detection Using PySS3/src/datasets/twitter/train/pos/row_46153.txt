A funny conversation I had with my mum So I wanted to go shooting both gun and bow/crossbow  (like to start going to learn how to do it). 

My dad reacted normally, he said "ye why not, you already shot a gun once". I was like yay cool

Then I told my mum...

Mum: umm no, girls aren't supposed to use guns, but you can go to learn how to shoot a bow

Me: mum do YOU know how to shoot a gun?

Mum: ... yes

Me : see girls can use guns 

Mum: *not knowing what to say because that was the first time I outsmarted her* umm okay I guess


So now when Covid is over ill go shooting
