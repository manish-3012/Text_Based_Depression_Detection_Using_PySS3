Minimum experience in retail So a shortie but a goodie,

Why the fuck do you need minimum 1 year retail experience for A PART TIME, ENTRY LEVEL, FIRST JOB?? I have been looking for MONTHS now and 8 out of 10 part timers require a 1 year minimum experience. How the hell do you expect people to be able to get part time jobs if you require a years experience? I may just be missing the point but Iâ€™m at wits end with this crap.
