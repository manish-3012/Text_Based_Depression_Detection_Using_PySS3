I've Jet lagged myself through my messed up sleep schedule. Ok so throughout the year I had a pretty normal sleep schedule, go to sleep at 2am wake up at 7am then go to school. But then..... yeah you guessed it lockdown happened.... first few weeks with online classes went well, grades were good and was ontop of work, then the holidays came, 2am to 7am sleep schedule turned to 6am to whenever my goddamn brother decides to start screaming at my monitor cause oooooooh this level in idk some random fighting game he decided to download on my xbox is too hard. So he's basically my biological alarm clock for a while. Then one day my mom gets this fantastic idea to go and visit my grandparents in France in the middle of a pandemic. Then on Friday of last week we flew to France thinking you know what this ain't gon be so bad, you know, nice weather, countryside alot to do, spend time away from my xbox maybe this can be good. SPOILER ALERT ONLY 10 HOURS OF IT EACH DAY HAVE GONE WELL. My grandad had the fantastic idea to cut the WI-FI when he goes to bed at around 10PM. Now I know what you're thinking "jUsT tUrN tHe Wi-Fi bAcK oN". Yeah no, not happening, I'm not gonna sneak into a 77 year old ex military absolute madlads room to flick on the Wi-Fi so I can browse reddit or YouTube only to get my Ass whooped in the morning. So my only options are either go to sleep like a normal human being or you can do something productive like read a book, or you can use up all your mobile data then, when u wake up download as many Netflix series or Movies as possible to keep uself sane because trying to fix a 2-3 month old sleep schedule is harder than you think.
