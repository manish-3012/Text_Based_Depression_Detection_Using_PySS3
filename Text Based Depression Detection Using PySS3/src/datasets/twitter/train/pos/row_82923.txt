found out y it doesnâ€™t feel like christmas they started drinking at 12 in the afternoon. now theyâ€™re just stumbling all over the place

u would think after the mess that christmas was last week they would stop drinking right ðŸ˜€ no absolutely. they started drinking at the same time they did last year 

i think im being a little dramatic but then i remember all the trauma i went through from my biological fatherâ€™s alcoholism so i think itâ€™s fair that ive locked myself in the bathroom for the past 2 hours
