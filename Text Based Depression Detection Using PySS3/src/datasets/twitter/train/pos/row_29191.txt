My dad is going to the hospital for covid. It's tough seeing him in the state he is, he could barely walk and breath in general. I am honestly not sure if he will make it or not but I have faith in him and he will be better. Im not religious anymore but I wanted to ask if those who see this post can make a prayer for his safety and for him to get better. Im trying to manifest that he's ok but idk I just hope that maybe this will help. Be safe and wash your hands.
