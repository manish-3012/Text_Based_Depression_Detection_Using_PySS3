I got my first job. I know nobody asked, but i got my first job today, and I'm pretty proud of myself. I'm only fifteen, and when i went for the interview the first time, i chickened out, because i felt that i wouldnt be useful, but someone i know convinced me to try, and i actually got it. And now i can help my mom. Anyway, thank you for reading.
