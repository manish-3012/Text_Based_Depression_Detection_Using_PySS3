That was weird and kinda scary tbh...  So, I'm Egyptian, I live in Kuwait and there's that traditional Iranian bakery which is humble and you have to buy from the window but their bread is so delicious. And I went there and said 'Alsalamu alikum' which means 'may peace be upon you' it's a very friendly gesture and usually you must say 'you too' otherwise you're a duchebag. Anyways, there were two young men working there and one of them looked at me and didn't reply while the other was busy, he took the money and was preparing the bread and his friend stared at me silently for a long time with a frown and his black beard and hair while he was lighting a match, it was so suspicious. The guy handed the bread over and I said thanks, again no reply from him. Then I just left and they didn't even say a word. I'm speechless.
