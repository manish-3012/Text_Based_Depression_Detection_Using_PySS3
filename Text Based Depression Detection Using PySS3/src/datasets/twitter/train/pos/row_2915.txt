I think i have a PTSD When I was like 7/8 y.o. my summer campus organized an event where we could sleep there, all was great until this bitch a lil older than me picked some "scary picture" and he showed me them all night, at first i cried but at 4 a.m. i had a breakdown and started screaming and punching random with my eyes closed, our teacher noticed and forced her to throw the photos in the trash. 
Five minutes ago my brother was scrolling an app for phone wallpaper and i've seen that image again, I shut down my playstation, gone to the living room and i'm there with my mom watching a film and I'm almost crying.
That image wasn't even that scary, but i'm trembling right now and i think i have a ptsd, i don't know exactly the symptoms but if someone knows what's going on in my brain please respond cuz I'm scared.

Thank you for reading
