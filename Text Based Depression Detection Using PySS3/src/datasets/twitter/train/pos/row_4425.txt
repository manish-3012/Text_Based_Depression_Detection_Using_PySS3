Iâ€™ve made a bad mistake.... HELP I was browsing for only fans leaked google drives (I know, how foolish of me) and I ended up coming across one. So I clicked on it, it redirected me to my google drive app (didnâ€™t think much of it since Iâ€™m on Christmas break) watched a ton of videos in it, just to realize Iâ€™m signed in on my school emails google drive account. There was some wacky shit on that porn file too. After seeing the activity that showed each video I opened, it was at least 3 pages long. I deleted the activity, but it said the collaborators/moderators (the school) can still see it. Iâ€™m very nervous and upset. Iâ€™m only a junior in highschool, will I be in deep trouble?? Or does anyone else have similar experiences??
