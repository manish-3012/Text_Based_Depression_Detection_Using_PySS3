I canâ€™t sleep because of school At night, I constantly worry about things like my grades, if my teachers hate me, or my workload. This causes me to lose a lot of sleep quite frequently. The only time I am distracted from this pain is during class, when I try to listen to my teachers but I end up falling asleep because I am distracted from the pain of my homework and my workload. I got out of bed this morning and I immediately started crying.
