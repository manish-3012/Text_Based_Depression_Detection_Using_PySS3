Idek what I'm feeling anymore honestly Every night I stay up later than I should and I feel this weird mixture of disappointment, depression, and anger

I'm fine when people are talking to me, but the moment I'm alone, I just feel like garbage. I'm tired of doing this every day and feeling like this. Feel like I don't matter

I can't get my sleep schedule back to normal either. I can barely muster motivation to get up in the morning or go and lift anymore

I'll probably delete this soon. Idek why I'm saying it
