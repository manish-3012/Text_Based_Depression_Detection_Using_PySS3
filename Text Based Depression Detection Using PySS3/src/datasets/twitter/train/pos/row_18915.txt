Need something to distract me constantly. I'm going through shit right now and it's been very hard. Id rather not go into details but it entails a loved one. I need stuff to keep my mind off of my feelers for a while. Keep me preferably off of my phone. I don't have friends really so sadly that won't work to hang out with them. I need motivation for life cause the one thing that kept me going is gone. Thanks.
