Am I allowed to talk about ps5? I feel like crap anytime I want to talk about the Ps5 because I know that a lot of people canâ€™t get things like this or have incredibly video game against parents. I feel like I should not talk about it because of other peopleâ€™s troubles but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s right, neither of my two friends have one and I wish I could invite them over but I canâ€™t because of stupid stupid COVID-19 and the stupider antimaskers and antivaxxers and everything is hard and why isnâ€™t my English teacher grading that assignment, I sent her three emails about it. I know I have a lot less struggle in my life than many people on this subreddit and that I shouldnâ€™t blow this out of proportion so their struggles are undervalued but I feel like I have to post this and get this off my chest. I feel like I probably should have stayed more to the title but I was writing this and I felt like I just had a lot of stuff I needed to get out. Sorry for this I know this is tiny compared to what others have gone through
