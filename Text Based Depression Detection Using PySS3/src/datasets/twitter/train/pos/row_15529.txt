Has this ever happened to you? So just imagine you're in public and you zone out. Right now most people would say "yeah I've zoned out while in public before, it's pretty normal".

Now while you're zoned out somebody sits in front of where you're looking, you have no idea because you're too busy zoned out. Let's say that this person doesn't know you're zoned out, and thinks you're just staring and they ask you to quit. 

Do you 
a) say sorry and tell them you had no idea.
B) ignore them and keep looking into the infinite abyss.
C) say sorry, but once they sit down you immediately zone out looking in the same direction 
D) run as fast as you can because you can't handle confrontation or deal with people talking to you.
