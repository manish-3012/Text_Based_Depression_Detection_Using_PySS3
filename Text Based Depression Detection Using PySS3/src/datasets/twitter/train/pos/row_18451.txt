We have been zoom bombed THREE times I have been zoom bombed three times, and Iâ€™ll get in trouble if I track their ip adress and 
It IS alREady DOinG thAt. Has anyone else experienced this? If you see any you tubers/tik tokers etc etc doing this, please tell them to stop. I am fine with people being like â€œHey, I have zoom bombed you, say something to YouTube ok byeâ€ But they just cuss a lot in Spanish. I canâ€™t understand it usually bc I donâ€™t speak Spanish but all my classmates do. What do I do? I know this has a flair of rant but Iâ€™m also asking, what do I do?
