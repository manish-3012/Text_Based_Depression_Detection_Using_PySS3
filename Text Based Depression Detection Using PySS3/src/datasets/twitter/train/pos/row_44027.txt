We are going broke So in India there is a ritual that the father gives his daughter a huge amount of money when he marries her to somebody. That is termed as â€œwedding giftâ€ but is dowry in plain sight. My father is a policaman and earns around $15000 yearly and has taken up loans too(for my siblings educatio). Those bastards are asking around $140K as â€œwedding giftsâ€œ in addition to a big fat Indian wedding that costs around $40k. We will not be able to afford it. So my father has decided to sell our house to pay to those bastards. We are homeless now. I think I cannot study in the US now. I worked my ass off in high-school and got a 4.0 gap and scored really high in the SATâ€™s. It does not matter now. I will have to study in India now. Before all of this, I thought maybe I can secure a 100% scholarship and my parents can pay for my living costs(and I will work too). Now I think I will have to crush my dreams and drop everything.

I donâ€™t know what to do, neither can I cry or feel sad and I have to put on a happy face because If I do my parents will feel bad for me doing this and they will take huge loans so that I can study in the US.  
Life is unfair.   
Iâ€™ll go rest now.
