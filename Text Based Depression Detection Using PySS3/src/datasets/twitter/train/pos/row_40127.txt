Selfish vs Self-care (TL;DR at the bottom) A lot of people still cant tell the difference between this. To make it short, being selfish is not helping for others when you can help others. Being selfish is NOT prioritizing your needs over others' wants. You need to be able to help yourself before you can help anyone else.

For example, being selfish is having 6 slices of pizza and not giving it to anyone, knowing that you can't eat all 6 slices by yourself. But if you only have one slice for yourself, and you don't give it to anyone because it's the only one you have, you are not being selfish, because you don't have enough to help everyone.

This also goes for mental health. A lot of people could only care for themselves, and aren't strong enough to lift the burden of others' problems. That quiet kid who doesn't want to talk to you because they have problems with their parents isn't selfish. It is that kid with rich parents who have 5 different colored phones and makes fun of anyone who doesn't worship them is the selfish one (and an asshole too.)

TL;DR: Help yourself, it's self care. Not helping others when you can, that's selfish.
