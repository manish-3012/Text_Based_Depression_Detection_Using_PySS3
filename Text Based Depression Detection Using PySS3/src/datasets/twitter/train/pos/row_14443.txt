Have you heard of the Santa paradox? What would happen if a naughty kid asks for coal? Santa would give him coal because he is a naughty child but that would mean that Santa is giving the naughty child what he wants which is against the rules. Naughty children can't get what they want but they can only get coal but if a naughty child asks for coal then Santa has no choice but to grant their wish and give them coal which doesn't make any sense because there is no way Santa would give the naughty children what they want for  Christmas. What do you think?
