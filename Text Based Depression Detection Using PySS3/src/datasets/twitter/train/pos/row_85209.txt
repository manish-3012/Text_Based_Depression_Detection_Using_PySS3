can someone explain this- context: i hung out with this girl like four times a month ago and for some odd reason met both of her parents while at her house

she snaps me tn and says: â€œfrom the couple times we hung out my parents were wondering if you sit with your legs crossed?â€

is there some joke here iâ€™m missing? a tiktok trend maybe? or just obscenely weird parents...?
