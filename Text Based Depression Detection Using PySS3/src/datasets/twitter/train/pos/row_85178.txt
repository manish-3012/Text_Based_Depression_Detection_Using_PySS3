Please help me find this meme The meme had a skeleton as the backgroud picture, the upper text went something like: "I am stupid and I have no money." and then the bottom part said: "That's it that's the whole meme". I swear it was hilarious, but I have no idea where it was from. Me and my friends were trying to find it for a long time, but unfortunately with no success as of now. If someone has this meme saved or knows where can we find it, please, share it with us. We would be very grateful. Thanks.
