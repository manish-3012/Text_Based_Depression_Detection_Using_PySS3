Helped a lady and her child get back into their car I work at a rural grocery store and there's not really any way to get help with this kinda thing, she had locked her keys in her door. I asked my manager and she let me help her since business was slow. I got ahold of a coat hanger and went to work getting around the seal in the door and eventually *1.5 hours 24F outside* I got the door unlocked. The reason it took me so long is the end of the coat hanger was too dull to grip the lock. Had to wait for the fire Marshall to come check it out, he lended me a pair of wire cutters and I sharpened the end to a point. Letting me grip the plastic better.
