"YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS SUB" (another sub).... *because we're permabanning you!!*

you people call yourselves a lot of things but the name of your sub is NOT one of them. im ln reduced meds and was trying to be uplifting. uplifting. and you removed, permabanned, and muted me? FUCK YOU, you hypocrites! I dont need that kind of "aggressive happiness" in my life if it means rejection if my encouragement doesnt take on the shape you'd prefer. I have my own way and walk. You OVERKILLED .... you absolutely overkilled. Removed, banned, muted. For a positive meme. That honestly wasn't that bad to begin with. Temper tantrum? whatever I call triple-aggression against a single redditor for a post and revised post - to be the real tantrum. 

P.S., this is a rant about a different sub. Not you guys. You're all good.
