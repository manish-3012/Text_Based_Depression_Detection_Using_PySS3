I wish I was attractive The only person that's not a familiar member to call me handsome was my ex girlfriend, and I'm just not attractive. A bunch of people tell me that I just need to wait for the right person, but I have a hard time believing them. My dad says because of my blonde hair and green eyes people could see me as attractive, but I just don't think so. I'm not someone you would look at and think "he's pretty cute" or "I want to go out with him" there are a ton of boys that go to my school that look way better than me and I just wish I was attractive. I find it so hard to believe when someone tells me that I'll find someone. Just because I had one girlfriend before doesn't mean it'll happen again.
