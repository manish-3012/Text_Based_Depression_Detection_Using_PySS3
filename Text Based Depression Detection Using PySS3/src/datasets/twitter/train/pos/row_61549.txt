Need advice at 1 am So Iâ€™ve slowly realized I let fear control my life, I donâ€™t do things in fear of looking stupid despite not thinking itâ€™s dumb when other people do it, I donâ€™t talk to people in fear of them not even wanting to talk to me and make them feel weird, fear of doing things just because it involves bare minimum human interaction. A complete loser, so (no offence) I know this isnâ€™t the best place to ask but, does anyone have ways to help not letting fear control my life so much?
