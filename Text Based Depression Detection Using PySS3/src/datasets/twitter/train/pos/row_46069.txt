[Shower Thought] America was discovered BECAUSE of capitalism. The Europeans werenâ€™t looking for land or adventure, they were looking for trade routes, and when they were traveling, they found two continents. Which makes sense because one of the countries in those continents is now a capitalism hell. (Also, the Vikings or the Indians donâ€™t count, they technically DID discover it first, but they shared it with nobody)
