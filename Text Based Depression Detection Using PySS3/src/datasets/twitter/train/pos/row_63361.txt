I'veGotNoPersonality checkkk Since I'm a little kid I've shown signs of being more academically advanced than my classmates, and that would often make adults tell me "oh, you are so smart". That ended up building the idea on my mind that in order to be smart you had to be more advanced than the rest of your classmates, but also, that being smart was the only good feature of mine, and that's why, in a sort of way, I needed to be the smartest (which meant, the most advanced kid in the class).
That's the reason why I've always been obsessed with school, and why I saw grades as a competition (and would feel awful when someone was better than me). 
At this point of my life, school's more difficult, and it's starting to be a problem that thing of being "smarter" than the rest. I'm incredibly afraid of failure, which drives me to procrastinate, so that way, I don't fail, and nobody """""notices""""" that I'm not """""smart"""""" anymore. I have to admit, one of the things that terrifies me the most is that all this time I've been obsessed with school, because, for me, being smart was part of my personality. That obsession didn't let me focus on other things that I liked. So now, I have to face the truth: 
I'm not the smartest kid in my class. I won't ever be. Being smart is not part of my personality, because I'm not smart. And since that was the only thing included in my personality, that means that I've got no personality. And I hate this lack of personality.
