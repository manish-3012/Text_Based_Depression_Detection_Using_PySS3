My brothers a piece of hot garbage For context: 2 weeks ago, my closest friend and i decided to take a break. I havent been taking it well since i have abandonment issues

I was venting to him (hes also 17) and he said "wow. At least i have people who would miss me if i died or was gone"

And i started bawling. My biggest fear is to die alone. It hurt so damn bad to hear that after i said i couldnt even go to my friend if i was scared.
