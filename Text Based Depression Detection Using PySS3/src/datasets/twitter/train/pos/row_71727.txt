So I was at PE and kids were talking about their shoes A kid said that another kids shoes were blue which meant that he could control water? Someone responds â€œlike shark boy and lava girlâ€. I said it is supposed to be fire boy and water girl. He stood his ground. Do I have permission to yeet him?
