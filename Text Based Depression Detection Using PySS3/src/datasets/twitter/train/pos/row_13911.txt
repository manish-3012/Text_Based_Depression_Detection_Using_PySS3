Finally fixing my hygiene, thats pretty cool. During the quarantine, my personal hygiene has been getting worse and worse, the odour escaping my body was absolutely acrid, I looked like death constantly and I would re-wear clothes until they discoloured.

Now I'm making attempts to get better, I shower every day, I make sure I small alright and I air out my room constantly, I just want to get my life back together piece by piece, I'm getting there bois.
