Today marks a year since my all time favourite interaction in this sub So I made a post joking about the appearance of female genitalia (how its technically an ongoing crack) and in response the post was flooded with pubescent boys trying to tell me that i was very wrong and have clearly never seen a vagina before. To me. A female girl. With female girl genitalia. And eyesight. Like?? Nothing has described the additude of this sub better i think

Also just in case: the labia continues the crack and no a female taint does not mark a clear seperation between buttcrack and genitalia like a male taint would
