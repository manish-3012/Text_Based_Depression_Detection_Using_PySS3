Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge: Day 58 Does anyone actually read the first portion of these? Well, if you do, make sure to comment if you have any questions about space or topics you'd like to see a fact on. See ya tomorrow!  


Fact: On the surface of Mars, sunsets appear blue! This occurs because the Martian atmosphere is made up of a specific kind of fine dust particles that are just the right size to allow blue light to get through the thin air more efficiently than it would on a planet like Earth. However, the light only stays near the area where the Sun is located in the sky, so the rest of the sky appears yellowish-orange, just like it does during the day. Combine that with the fact that the Sun only appears to be about half as big as it does on Earth, and you get an almost eerie scene. This makes a Martian twilight even MORE beautiful, but it's not all just for looks.

Martian sunsets have quite a bit of scientific value as well! Images taken from NASA's Curiosity and Opportunity rovers have allowed scientists to use the blue glow of Martian sunsets to determine just how high into the atmosphere the fine dust particles go. Other discoveries have also shown that the Sun's glow can still be visible for a few hours after sunset, similar to a phenomenon that occurs on Earth in areas where a volcano has recently erupted.

As for sunrises on Mars, they make the Red Planet's familiar color (caused by iron oxide, also known as rust) pop even more! All in all, Mars is a beautiful planet, and we need to get there ASAP!!

[I mean, just imagine the scene: the year is 2037. You're hanging out in the mess hall of your colony habitat in the northern hemisphere of Mars, eating your canned dinner after a hard day's work tuning the O2 production units and farming. You sit down at the table and take a peek out the circular window, to be greeted with this.](https://preview.redd.it/wgidiut2i0b61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5fa612ebf9a9dc645ccd38dd26d6252ae64c799)
