my county is prioritizing education over prisons, and jails every human life has an equal value. a human being any animal of the species Homo sapien. this includes everyone from murderers, to that guy who smokes weed in class, to man who works job at place, to your 100 year old racist grandma 

now that thatâ€™s out of the way, what do you think would save more lives, vaccinating teachers, or vaccinating the people who are living in basically a petri dish, and thatâ€™s not even mentioning the fact that my county prison has the most covid cases of any correctional facility in the united states
