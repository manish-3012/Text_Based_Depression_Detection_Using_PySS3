Driver's licenses Ok so as soon as I turned 15 I got my learner's permit (its required to have it for a year in my state before you can get your license) and my state has you take a couple multiple hour long online classes if you want your license at 16 so I did all that (it was like 42 hours total) and the day I turned 16 I went to take my test to get my license. I say all that to say that I did everything i could to make sure i got my license as  soon as possible, and I've seen and heard allot of my friends around my same age not caring about getting it at all or waiting the last possible time to get it. And I was wondering just why? Growing up everyone's hoping and waiting till they can leave the house with out mom or dad and the driving is like the biggest step for that so I'm asking anyone who did wait or ppl who know why other ppl wait.
