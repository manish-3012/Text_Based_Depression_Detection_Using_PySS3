How can I get my parents to stop taking my phone Iâ€™m 15 years old, and ever since I got a phone (2 years ago) they insist on taking it every night. When I ask them why, itâ€™s always â€œso you can get a good nights sleepâ€ as if Iâ€™m not able to control what time I get off my phone. On top of that, even with my phone gone, I still end up going to sleep around 1am each night during the school year. This rule makes me really angry, as I see myself as more than responsible enough to do something as simple as keep my phone at night. It might be a little first- worldy for me to complain about, but thatâ€™s how I feel. Anyways, Iâ€™m looking for suggestions on how to get them to stop
