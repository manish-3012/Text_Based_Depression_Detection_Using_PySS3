Lol I'm so forgetful Made some hot coco, great....waited for it to brew and went to my computer. Completely forgot about the hot coco for a while...(can't smell it, so that probably is a factor...) 

I came back maybe half an hour later from watching youtube instead of doing school... added some more hot water from the coffee machine..., stirred and took a sip yum.......oh wait, why is it bitter? Yep, I used a coffee machine for the water and forgot to remove the coffee pod(again) so now I have hot coco coffee. Which tastes...interesting? 

I also left a banana on a table cause I forgot I didn't finish it.. 

WHY AM I SO FORGETFUL
