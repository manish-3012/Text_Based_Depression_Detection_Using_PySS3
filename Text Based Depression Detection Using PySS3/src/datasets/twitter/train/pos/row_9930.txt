On a scale of 1-10, how lame is collecting lightsabers? I have begun to collect lightsabers, kind of as a hobby, and I've started to feel kind of ashamed of it. I really enjoy it, though. 

I'm not considering stopping this collection, but I'm not thinking I'm going to broadcast it out to the world or anything, either. I'm just honestly wondering, where would this fall on the lameness scale? 1 being least lame, 5 being that it wouldn't change your opinion of a person at all, and 10 being super lame. Brutal honesty appreciated, thanks.
