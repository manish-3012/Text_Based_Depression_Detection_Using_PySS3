I simply donâ€™t like BTS... Every online class I go thereâ€™s always those BTS obsessed freshmen. Iâ€™ve tried given them a go and itâ€™s so bland and repetitive for me. Every song and video is just BAM BAM BAM and all the same. I have no idea why their fan base is so huge and topping the charts. Iâ€™ve given other KPOP groups a chance like Blackpink and actually enjoyed. Iâ€™m convinced itâ€™s all the looks and style. Donâ€™t even get me started about the fan base...
