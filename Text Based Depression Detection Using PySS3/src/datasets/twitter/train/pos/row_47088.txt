Life is not so great atm I (m fyi) made one of my best friends rly uncomfortable, and now I'm being left on read/delivered. She is the one I text the most with, and I don't text much with others. I recently got into a big argument w my mom and it isnt completely solved yet. Online school is stressful for me, so I can't distract myself w that. My games are getting boring, so gaming isn't rly an option to distract myself either. Quarantine has in general just made me feel really REALLY lonely.

Even tho I flaired this with rant, any advice would be appreciated.
