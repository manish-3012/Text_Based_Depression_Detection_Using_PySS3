Global recycling day coming soon Hi, yâ€™all. A bit of context to begin with, Iâ€™m part of my schools student council and weâ€™re trying to raise some money for charity. I need some help with coming up with stuff to do regards global recycling day on the 18th of March. Obviously, the (UK) restrictions due to the pandemic offers some problems. Any help will be greatly appreciated and if I used an idea from this post then I will send an update and give the poster a small gesture of thanks. Anyways, have a nice day and stay safe.
