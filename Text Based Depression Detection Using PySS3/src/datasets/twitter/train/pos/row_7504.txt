I just realized 15 dollars as a minimum wage is barely livable... Lemme show you what I mean by creating an â€œaverageâ€ situation

Letâ€™s say rent for a month is 1000, life insurance is 25, car insurance is 133, food is 250, utilities (water, gas, electricity) are 260, internet is 57, phone bill is 115, health insurance is 450, car gas is 250. That comes out to 2665 dollars for â€œbare necessitiesâ€ in one month. 

Now for a year that comes out to 31,980 dollars.
If you are only making around 31,200 dollars a year, and you have to pay at LEAST (cus I probably forgot some expenses) an average of 31,980 dollars a year for the bare minimum, itâ€™s not a livable wage. 

Thatâ€™s considering you donâ€™t take any vacations the whole year, never miss a day of work, never get sick and have to pay medical bills, never buy new clothes, have any streaming services, buy any gifts for anyoneâ€™s birthday, donâ€™t have to pay student loan debts, donâ€™t have anyone else to take care of, have no pets, and never participate in any activities that cost money.

Yes I copied this from a comment I just made but like.. itâ€™s relevant. Itâ€™s important to think about. Itâ€™s crazy to think about. And thatâ€™s hardly even average because if you look up the average monthly spendings of a person (in America) it comes out to about 5,000 dollars which means youâ€™d be spending 60,000 dollars a YEAR which is DOUBLE what youâ€™d make working 40 hours a week on minimum without any vacations or sick days.
