Why do guys compliment when girls are all messy Okay so like, Iâ€™ve been wondering for a little bit as a female why guys tend to compliment their significant other when theyâ€™re all messy and lazy. Is it because itâ€™s cute seeing us all tired or is it just up to the guys preference? Just wondering honestly. Also, when a guy calls you beautiful does he usually mean it?
