How did you get over toxic, fake friends If you need context over the situation my friend thinks dating is some kind competition. She also swiped right on a guy that she knew I really liked. I have a detailed post on my home page. I'd suggest you skim over it.

The problem is, I'm an extrovert with low confidence and self respect. I'm not proud of it. I cut off a shitty friend in my right before senior year and I had to be all alone for the whole year. Its not easy for me to make friends. So I try to keep my old ones. After this should I be giving my friend a second chance? My sister just screamed at me for thinking this way. I just don't want to be alone again. People in my group are closer to her than me....I'll lose all of them. I can't live senior year all over again ffs. What should I do?
