My crush likes my best friend and they both know I like her. Her and I end up having a Zoom call from 11:00 at night to 4:00 in the morning, just talking about ourselves and giving advice. 

So I called her and asked her if she would ever feel the same way I do the next day. 

She then tells me she didnâ€™t mean to lead me on with the Zoom and that it was a mistake. 

My best friend still doesnâ€™t know about the Zoom either, so now I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Thanks for listening.
