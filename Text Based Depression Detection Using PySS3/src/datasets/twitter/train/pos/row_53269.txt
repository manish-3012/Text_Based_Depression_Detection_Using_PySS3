Hey! I know many of you want to learn or already know how to code. I've created a Discord server exactly for that! So I've created a Discord called Teen Programmer Hangout, a place for all teenage programmers and programmer-prospects to learn, improve, collaborate and hangout.

You can:
- chat about programming
- get help with your coding problems
- find people to work with
- improve your coding skills

If you're interested feel free to DM me for an invite! I hope to see you all there :)
