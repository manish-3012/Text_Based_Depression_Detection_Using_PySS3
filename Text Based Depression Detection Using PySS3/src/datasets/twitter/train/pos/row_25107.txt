My cat was dying in my dream I live at the 5th floor of an apartment. Living room windows are looking to the street. In my dream, i opened the window to look outside. My cat jumped out of the window the second i opened it. He fell on a car. Blood came out of him. I ran outside. He was still on the car, sitting. I was suprised and shocked. Only his foot was broken and there was some blood on his paw. Why dreams has to be this realistic? Why there has to be blood... What does this mean?.. What i did to deserve this... :( I was so scared
