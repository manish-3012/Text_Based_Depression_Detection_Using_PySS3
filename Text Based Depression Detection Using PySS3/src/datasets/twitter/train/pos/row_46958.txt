How do I ask my girlfriend is she is cheating on me without seeming like I donâ€™t trust her? My girlfriend has been a bit off lately, we have been fighting more and she like to talk to this â€œfriendâ€ all the time. I feel a bit paranoid but her best friend noticed it seemed a bit odd. How should I go about this?
