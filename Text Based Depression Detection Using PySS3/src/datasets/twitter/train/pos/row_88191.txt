I found a new hobby that makes me forget my self esteem issuesðŸ§ So besides making earrings and doing acrylic pours, I've started piercing my stuffed animals. I have a lot of em and they take up a lot of space. They're also very bland. But I started using spare jump rings and chains from my earrings supplies and giving them piercings or just putting chains on certain parts I think would look cool. I've only done it to a few and whenever I get the chance imma get some safety pins to try smth different. But yeah it's really fun and cheap ðŸ¤  ik nobody asked but yeah
