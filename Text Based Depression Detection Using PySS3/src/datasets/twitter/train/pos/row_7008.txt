This isnâ€™t much of a rant but I am so damn happy lmao A few months ago (before covid) my mom went to court with my dad to gain custody over me &amp; my sister. I donâ€™t wanna have a long ass paragraph but to make it short she got custody after fighting for 7+ years (it was split custody before) but Iâ€™m just so relived to be able to stay in a home I feel safe in &amp; happy in. 
 
My dad never physically abused me or my 2 sisters (the oldest is 19 and not relevant to the story since sheâ€™s an adult &amp; lives alone so like-) anyways, he never physically hurt us but made me &amp; my sisters emotionally hurt &amp; none of us remember much from our childhood since we suppressed most of the memories. 

But as I said Iâ€™ve been living with my mom now for around 3 months and I havenâ€™t really talked much about it to anyone except for close friends from my old school. Iâ€™ve been settling in and trying to get into a better state of mind and yeah...itâ€™s going really good. 

This was a random ramble and some of it probably doesnâ€™t make sense but oh well. 

Have a good day/night yâ€™all!!
