I wish I had close friends that I could have sleep overs with. I haven't had a sleepover in a long time, they were so much fun when I was younger. I've barely even been to some of my friends' houses. I'm such a loser. 

Why can't I just be more social? Why do I care so much about my friends, I doubt they even like me. I'm so fucking stupid.
