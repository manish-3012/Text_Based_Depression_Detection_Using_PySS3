Ight fellas big question Dated this girl about 2 years ago, cut it off due to her being busy, both liked eachother for a while and then sort of drifted apart as she went on exchange, got no idea how she feels as the last time we talked we talked about seeing where things went after she got back from exchange but that was a year ago and like i said, we drifted apart. Recently, during the last couple months we've been talking and i know i still like her. Not sure if the move is to just bite the bullet and ask her out to get a definitive yes or no.
