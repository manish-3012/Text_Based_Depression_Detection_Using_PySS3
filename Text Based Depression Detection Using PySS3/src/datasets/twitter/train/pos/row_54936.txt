I have something wrong with me but I don't what Recently I've a "mysterious pain" in my upper right side which has been not severe enough to think I have cancer but enough to have that thought of "maybe I do"
I genuinely don't know what it could be but the pain has spread so I seriously don't know what to do. Also my grandpa had liver cancer which doesn't help
