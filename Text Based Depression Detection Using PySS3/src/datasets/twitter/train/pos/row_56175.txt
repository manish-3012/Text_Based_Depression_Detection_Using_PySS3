When are guys gonna learn that girls like feminine guys? Iâ€™m not a girl, but I have a shit ton of friends who told me they think like this. Like, look at Tom Holland. Name a single girl who wouldnâ€™t let him drain all his fluids inside of her.

Obviously not all girls think like this so donâ€™t get mad at me if you like it when guys belittle you and make you feel like shit.
