To explain what is happening in lebanon rn So basically the marineport hangar contained some fireworks and sodium nitrate and after the fireworks ignited "by accident" they both exploded leaving the 700m radius in ruins and until now 80 ppl are dead 4500 are injured and 24 are missing to add also lebanon is full of corrupt politicians which is gonna cause all the money that is gonna be donated to be stolen like always since that actually made the country go bankrupt and make everything even bread expensive

Thanks for listening have a great day and please pray for us
