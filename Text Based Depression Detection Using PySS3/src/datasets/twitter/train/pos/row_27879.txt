so I hung out w my crush in the city yesterday. i donâ€™t think he really likes me ofc he likes me as a friend, but I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™m supposed to flirt with him though. heâ€™s just so friendly to everyone and mostly hangs out with girls. 

we went to some vintage shops and we got bubble tea, it was actually really nice. I even told him about how I actually felt ab hanging out with him (and said that I thought itâ€™d be awkward), but I didnâ€™t realise that it might have came off as rude. I just get anxious when I like people. 

but fr though, it kinda felt a bit like a date. but at the same time, we didnâ€™t really flirt besides the occasional â€œthis would look good on youâ€ and â€œyou would suit everything in this storeâ€ 

idk. it was nice. but I donâ€™t think he likes me in that way :/
