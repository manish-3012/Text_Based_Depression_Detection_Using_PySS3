How I got full points on a presentation about ''Pitbull helped Astronomy'' Basically we had to do a project in small groups about a person that helped out in astronomy. No one in our group did any work on it over the weekend. So last night I made it all my own. I started the first two slides out with pictures of Pitbull and how he helped. All made up, mind you. Then switched over to Katie Bouman and gave a really good presentation. Full points and made everybody laugh with my confidence that Pitbull is a big nerd.
