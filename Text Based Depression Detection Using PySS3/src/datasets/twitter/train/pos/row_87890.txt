I need advice cause this hasnâ€™t happened before and I donâ€™t know what to do So, I went over to a friends house for a party, and we were all hanging out and me and my friends sister were kind of flirting a bit the whole time. We also texted a couple nights later pretty much the whole night. Iâ€™m starting to like her and she also likes me(I was told this by her friend so I assume it is true) but itâ€™s my friends sister so Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Heâ€™s not one of my super close friends, but he is still one of my friends and I donâ€™t know if it would be weird or not and so Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I feel like it would be weird to talk to my friend about it too, especially cause we donâ€™t talk that much, so Iâ€™m not sure what I should do.
