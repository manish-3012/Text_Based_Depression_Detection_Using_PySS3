I need to vent Sorry if this annoys anyone,but feel I can tell you guys about my problems:

-I have severe anxiety.that joyous trait ties in to almost every problem I have listed.its like fighting an uphill battle with myself,and to be honest itâ€™s fucking tiring.

-my brother is a complete asshole.he annoys me almost constantly and plays with my mental health like itâ€™s a fucking toy.he hacks my families peace apart like a rusty meat hook,and doesnâ€™t give a shit.and Iâ€™ve always got to pick up the peices.

-my dad is also another problem.I know heâ€™s a good man,but thereâ€™s just so much.he made me turn off the voice lines in COD:warzone because they swore ONCE,but also tells me to â€˜act my ageâ€™ he also has no problem using strings of curse words in front of me.he tells me that Iâ€™ll â€˜burn myself outâ€™ if I keep worrying.WELL STOP STOKING THE FUCKING FIRE! 

-whenever something bad happens,itâ€™s always my PS4â€™s fault.never him,or anxiety,or lack of sleep(also somehow caused by gaming) nooo,always that nasty technology.

Iâ€™ll make another post if I remember anything else,if you have any tips,please comment them.sorry for bothering you,happy spooktober
