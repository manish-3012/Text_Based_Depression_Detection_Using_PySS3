Bot removed my art because it thought it was a repost!!! Okay I hate rants but this ticked me off! Mere seconds after I uploaded my art it was taken down. I was bummed out because I was really proud of it. It kept me from falling asleep so I just went to check if it was because the dress the character was wearing had exposed shoulders. But apparently it thought it was a reupload!!! The ok only other platform I uploaded it on was my twitter less than an hour before with 3 watermarks for socials. So I doubt it was stolen and uploaded right after! It made me really mad.

But it's not the end of the world. I can always go back and add colour, fix lines, proportions, and detail. I'll start work on that soon.

My name's Spearmph, and thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
