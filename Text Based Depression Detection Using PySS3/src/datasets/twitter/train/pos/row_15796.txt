I convinced my brother to play with meee My big brother (whos 20 while Iâ€™m 15) moved to Texas for college and we only text now but our schedules are so different our texts are usually separated by hours because he has college and work while I have school and other activities. Last night we had a full conversation and he promised to play online with me after he got done work. When he got home it was nearly eleven for me but he said that he was going to set up everything today and he promised to play with me tonight and Iâ€™m so happy.
