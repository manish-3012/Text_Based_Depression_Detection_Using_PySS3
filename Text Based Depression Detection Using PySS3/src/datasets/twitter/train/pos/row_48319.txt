Welp, I'm lonely, yet again So, I've been ghosted, by so many people, its tough, I've lost most all my friends, I've lost everything I honestly loved. The girl of my dreams has a kid now, so she's out of the picture, the girl who liked me most of our life realized after a week of dating that she doesn't actually like me so she ghosted me. Then her cousin became interested in me, I blew that one on my own by being my awkward self. 2020 sucked, 2021 better not be as bad.
