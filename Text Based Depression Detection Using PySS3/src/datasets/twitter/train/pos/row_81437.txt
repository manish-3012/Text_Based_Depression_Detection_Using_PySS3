Need advice. 15 year old McDonalds employee trying to get time off. Okay, I've worked at McDonald's for almost 3 months. So, today I called my manager to say I wouldn't be able to do my next two shifts because I have to attend TAFE to visit a Lab. The lesson at the lab would take place over three days. She simply said "I won't say yes. Unless you find a replacement." Which is basically saying I'm forced to work even though I can't come in, because I've been unable to find a replacement. She also told me that I need to get time off 2 weeks in advance, but I told her I only found out a short time ago, and I have been constantly trying to trade shifts with people. If I can't come in, then that's that, I can't come in. Especially for something involving education. And now I'm not sure what to tell her. I'm not sure she'll accept that I can't work. What do I do?
