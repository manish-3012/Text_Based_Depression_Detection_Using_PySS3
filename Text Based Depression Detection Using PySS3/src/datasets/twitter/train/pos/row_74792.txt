I just realized, that.. Teenagers out there are asking out their crushes, getting gfs, messing with stocks, getting cars, improving their drawing skills, making memes, interacting with people, getting scholarships, etc.

And there is Me courage less, lonely af, knows nothing about stocks, stealing car in gta only, knows nothing about art, lacks sense of humor, sits in front of pc whole day- don't know how to interact with humans, useless never got a scholarship, etc.
