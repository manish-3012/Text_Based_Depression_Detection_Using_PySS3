Surprising what you can make for cheap. So I like making various forms of media with what I have accessible to me. 
I can make an animation with Opentoonz and Blender, make games with Unity, write a book with Google Docs. You can do wonders with a potato of a computer and free software.

Recently I've been needing to buy some stuff for my hobbies, but luckily I can substitute with other things. Currently I'm using a $3 Guitar Hero Microphone from a thrift store and it works wonderfully, even working on PC since it's still a Logitech Mic. I've been working on a VR game so I'm using my phone as a make-shift headset and I'm gonna try to find a cheap 360 Kinnect as make-shift controllers until I either get a real setup or book an hour at the VR Arcade to properly set up the controls.
