I'm a Double/Triple spy in SMP, WTF DO I DO??? Okay so my friends are on an SMP and apparently while I was gone they started a war over I don't even know what. I'm closer friends with the guys on the "EU" team, but the guys on the American's side recruited me and said they needed someone good at MC to join their forces. My base is on EU land so they wanted to recruit me as a spy. I don't know exactly what I was going to do but it sounded cool, but then I spent some time with the members of the "EU" faction and I think the faction I'm with who are called "The American's" griefed them which is a total dick move. But I'm not sure if they did or not.

WHICH SIDE DO I CHOOSE??? HELP
