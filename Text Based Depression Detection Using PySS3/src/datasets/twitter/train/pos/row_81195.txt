I hate the United States and Iâ€™m tired of its bullshit If the us doesnâ€™t improve I might move to Canada, Australia, Japan or one of the nordic countries or something, I donâ€™t want to do that but I also donâ€™t want to live in America as it is now but I wonâ€™t even have that option for 3 years and realistically I wonâ€™t for 7-15 years and no matter where you live you will be affected by America so the ideal thing would be for America to be a good place to live and not be horrible but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s going to happen 

As long as I can keep my us citizenship Iâ€™m completely indifferent to moving internationally to a democratic non authoritarian country with freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of religion in practice (not like Russia where itâ€™s technically a democracy but is it though or China where they technically have freedom of religion but not really)
