My dog â€˜helpsâ€™ me unload the dishes Idk, why I posted this but.... itâ€™s quite cute and I think some might like it :)

My dog, age 7, is a really anxious Labrador. Heâ€™s had issues with separation and hates doors. We adopted him when he was 2, from a rescue trust.
Anyway, I have one of my chores as unloading the dishwasher, and my dog, Albie, always wants to be there. He always needs to â€˜helpâ€™ or be in the middle. So, I hold up a plate or mug, and he sniffs it, and taps my wrist with his paw if itâ€™s clean. He licks it if itâ€™s not, and it goes back in the sink. The way he runs up to the washer whenever he hears any dishwasher open is so funny, and sometimes if itâ€™s a completely clean load, I get a dirty bowl, rinse it, then spread peanut butter on the inside.
I taught him to do the wrist thing, before that he just backed away from the clean dish ware.
I hope this made your day a little better lol!
Happy New Year!
