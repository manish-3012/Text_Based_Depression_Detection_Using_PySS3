Im sobbing over nothing (not new) and need to vent but cant do it on insta because im not an attention seeker and dont want to be called one Last night I was genuinely happy for the first time in a while. I got one step closer to getting a black belt in martial arts.

And today I just crashed. I have no motivation for anything, I have videos to make but can't make myself do it. I thought a nice video call with my friends would help me cheer up.

I called them. No answer. That is how it usually goes. One call, no one answers and everyone answer on the second call.

Well, no one answered. No one said "i can't talk rn" or anything. I got a call back from one friend saying "Im watching tv leave me tf alone"

Not even my girlfriend is answering, but idk if shes awake. She often oversleeps nowadays.

I feel like garbage because I shouldve dealt with it like a normal person, but abandonment issues mixed with an already trashy day sucks. 

I broke down. Sobbing and choking. Im never like this.

I feel petty and worthless.

I only have a few friends, and everyone ive been friends with before messes up my mental health and dips.

Feel free to ignore me, everyone does, i should get used to it.

My parents wont talk to me and my sister says im weak for breaking down over nothing.


I just need someone to talk to.
