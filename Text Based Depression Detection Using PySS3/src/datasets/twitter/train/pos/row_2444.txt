Iâ€™m proud of myself you know why? Me and my brother came down stairs at the same time to put our microwave lunches in and I was able to put mine in first! The reason why Iâ€™m proud of it is because mine takes like 10 minutes. So yeah Iâ€™m wasting 10 minutes of my brothers life because Iâ€™m inpatient.
