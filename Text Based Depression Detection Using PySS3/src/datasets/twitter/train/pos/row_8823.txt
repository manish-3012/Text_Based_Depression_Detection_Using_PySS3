Something I donâ€™t like THINKING YOUR THE SHIT! Donâ€™t think your the shit and act like it. KNOW YOUR THE SHIT, and act like it. Dammit I hate going to school and seeing assholes who are so (popular) and they are annoying because you can see straight through them. I KNOW Iâ€™m the shit, I stay quite and Iâ€™m confident in myself. I donâ€™t need validation from nobody, like the person who acts like they are the shit. KNOW YOUR THE SHIT, donâ€™t THINK your the shit.
