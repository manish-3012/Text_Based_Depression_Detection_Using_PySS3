Just had the weirdest fucking dream Ok so im running up this hill that exits my neighbourhood and screaming for help. The reason. Im being chased by Thanos and people dressed in black as theyve come to kidnap me. Im not kidding. Eventually they catch up to me on the front street and force me into their car. Where one of the goons try to suffocate a puppy with a plastic bag but i stop them by going along with their plan... competing in a beauty pagent. I go on stage and quickly run off to the cafe running past a bunch of tall girls drenched in fake tans that make them look like the colour of mars and as im deciding wheather to eat a bowl ull of brownies or a clear cup with crumbs on the bottom, cookie dough in the middle and marshmellows on top i woke up. Ive never ate in dreams before it would been a niche experience to try it.
