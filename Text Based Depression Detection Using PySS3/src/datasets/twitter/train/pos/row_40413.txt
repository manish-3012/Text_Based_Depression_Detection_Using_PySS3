How do I deal with this So for my whole life my brother has always tried to get on my nerves because he find some sick pleasure out of making me mad I honestly donâ€™t understand it. He loves to metal in my life and act like heâ€™s so perfect and Iâ€™m like some lowlife whore. Like letâ€™s say I eat three pieces of pizza he will make fun of me for a month and be like oh I thought you said you were on a diet like a month ago or like youâ€™re so fucking fat or whatever when he really doesnâ€™t care. He does it because he thinks it makes me mad when really it just annoys me it doesnâ€™t make me mad at all and I guess making me mad like itâ€™s funny to him even though he never does.
So everyoneâ€™s like oh yeah just ignore him and heâ€™ll stop thatâ€™s not what happens when I ignore him he assumes that his plan is working because he knows that if Iâ€™m ignoring him Iâ€™m trying to get him to stop which means Iâ€™m distressed. So I can ignore him for an hour and this boy is very ADHD has a lot of mental issues and is very persistent so he will sit there for three hours trying to annoy me like he wonâ€™t stop like a normal person he wonâ€™t walk away usually and get bored heâ€™ll just amp up the volume and just do something slightly worse every few minutes To the point where I want to beat the shit out of him. 
In fact heâ€™s annoyed my parents to the point where anytime heâ€™s doing something to me they wonâ€™t even get in between it theyâ€™ll just let him do it. Also if I donâ€™t ignore him and I express that Iâ€™m upset or you know just do something about it in general it has the same affect and he just keeps doing it more and more and more so Iâ€™ll give him attention Or make myself look stupid or some shit and he will also keep doing it even though Iâ€™m not ignoring him. 
like another example of this would be like if I slept till 5 PM every day for a week he would not let me live that shit down for like two months like every time I see him in person because we donâ€™t live together we do see each other every day though youâ€™ll be like oh yeah thatâ€™s the lazy fat bitch of a sister I have when in reality Iâ€™m just sleeping till 5 PM because I stayed up all night crying over some dumb shit. I should mention heâ€™s 12 years old but he has the mentality of like a seven-year-old like everyone kept telling me he would grow out of this stuff when he was like eight but no it just got worse and I am 17 and it seems like since I only have one more year heâ€™s really laying it in me this year because he knows Iâ€™m moving away when I turn 18 and Iâ€™ll hardly see him. 
He also roasts me and since like he has this god like complex about himself itâ€™s really hard to roast him back because heâ€™s over here acting like heâ€™s a little miss perfect and he actually thinks he is so itâ€™s like even when I do roast him it doesnâ€™t affect him at all and even if I do act like itâ€™s not affecting me and he still somehow knows it is.  Thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that either like I canâ€™t help whether something affects me or not or triggers me or not. But like for everybody who also has a sibling thatâ€™s crazy like this how do you get under their skin in these situations how do you make them feel like youâ€™re feeling and make them want to go away and never wanna talk to you or hang out with you.
Also this kid wants attention so bad that if I donâ€™t give it to him he annoys me. Like letâ€™s say one day he was doing his annoying bullshit trying to make me mad and then the next day he wants to hang out and Iâ€™m like no you did that shit yesterday so Iâ€™m not hanging out with you why would I hang out with an asshole. The next day heâ€™ll just do it 10 times worse and harder and make me want to slap the shit out of him even more like itâ€™s a whole cycle like this dude wants me to hang out with him even though heâ€™s a little bitch and then when I donâ€™t hang out with him he acts like an even bigger bitch. But sometimes when I pretend like I actually want to hang out with him heâ€™s kind of nice to me but most of the time he still mean to me.
Like I just wanna know how do I make this kid hate me as much as I hate him I mean obviously I donâ€™t actually hate him because heâ€™s my brother.  But like I have no desire to hang around this kid regularly like he wants to annoy me and stuff like I donâ€™t understand that I have no desire to annoy him I just want to stay on my side of the room and not talk to him because I donâ€™t have any desire to have anything to do with him. And itâ€™s not like he looks up to me either because he seems to think that Iâ€™m some big fat lazy unsuccessful sack of shit. He genuinely just wants to be around me so he can annoy me but I donâ€™t understand the appeal in that like why is that so entertaining like go play your fucking video games if youâ€™re bored I do. 
I should also mention this kid is extremely spoiled and has never been disciplined because heâ€™s the youngest and my parents donâ€™t believe in like disciplining at all not even grounding my parents are just like oh yeah if heâ€™s doing something bad then whoever is the victim can fucking deal with him themselves itâ€™s not our problem.
So obviously Iâ€™m wondering do any of you have similar experiences and if so how do I get under this kids skin so much that he doesnâ€™t want to hang out with me just as much as I donâ€™t want to hang out with him like how do I be that annoying horrible sibling because itâ€™s like when I roast him or do the stuff that he does to me it doesnâ€™t affect him.
