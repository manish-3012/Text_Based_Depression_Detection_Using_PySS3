Being aware that I'm being used... So this girl who was cheating behind my back with multiple guys (4-5 months ago) texted me outta nowhere apologizing and shit and wanting to be friends again (2 weeks from now). She started calling me often and we'd talk for hours as if nothing ever happened in the past. But today when she called, I came to know EXACTLY why she started doing all this. She mentioned that one guy that I KNOW FOR SURE slept with her but she doesn't admit (have gone through quite heartbreaking screenshots and videos from her google photos as proof) well that guy has stopped talking to her since 2 weeks (yup, lines up quite accurately)

The way she talked to me so far made me believe she doesn't have any of those fuccbois around her to talk with her, hence she started talking to me again. After finding out about her sleeping with other dudes, I never thought I'd have her in my life again, nor I wanted her back in my life to begin with. But talking to her does make me feel nice. These past few months I've been feeling quite lonely and having her back in my life doesn't feel bad although it absolutely should. She's the only girl I ever dated and we dated for like 3 years. Never doubted her, never checked her phone when I should've.

So like, the only reason I'm still in touch with her is that I'm using her to compensate my loneliness, but the outcome is going to be quite obvious as eventually that dude will start talking to her again and she'll stop talking to me. I wonder for how long I'll keep doing this...

Wasn't here to get advice or anything. Just wanted to share it anonymously
