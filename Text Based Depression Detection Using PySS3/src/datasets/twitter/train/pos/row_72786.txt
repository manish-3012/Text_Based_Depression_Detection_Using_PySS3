Can you tell the name of this show I used to watch but I forgot after some time? It was an animated show about a gang of villains who were not so super like. Their leader had a short height, wore a red costume. There were 2 to 3 other members. They had a dog probably named Dommageddon something. In one of the episodes, they sink an entire city to make the chips not crunchy.
