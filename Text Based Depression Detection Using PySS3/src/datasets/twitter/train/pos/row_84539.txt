I just got banned from r/offmychest for commenting on a post in r/tumblrinaction ðŸ¤  I... I am speechless. I would upload a photo (which I will do later in the week) but we can't do that rn, as y'all all know. 



I can't even make this up. I'm still trying to figure out if it's a troll and they somehow figured out how to make their message look like a moderator's.




I don't know whether to be mad... or? But they said that r/tumblrinaction systematically hurt them, idrk what they mean by that. But uh... has anyone else been through this?
