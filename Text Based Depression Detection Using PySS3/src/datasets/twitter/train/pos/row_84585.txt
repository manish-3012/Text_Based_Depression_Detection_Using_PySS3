time after time is a recruitment song for the christian church ok here me out.

 "If you're lost you can look and you will find me  
Time after time  
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting  
Time after time"

That's obviously referring to how god is always there for you and he'll protect you. Also, time after time- what does a t look like? A cross. What did Jesus die on? A cross. 

Therefore, Time after Time is a recruitment song and Cydni Lauper was a secret agent for the christian church. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk, I hope this has been informative
