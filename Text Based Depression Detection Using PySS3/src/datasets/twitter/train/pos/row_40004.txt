I need a little advive So basically...
I'm in a group of 6 close friends. Great people, care about them deeply. If I need to talk I'll always find at least one willing. Its just...

In the group I feel like an outsider. I feel like I'm the irritating one who everyone just tolerates. Nobody said this, its just how I feel and honestly I'm unsure and desperate. If you have any advice please help me.
