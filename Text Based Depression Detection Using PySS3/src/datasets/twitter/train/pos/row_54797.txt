Do athletic girls usually like a non-athletic guy?  

Obviously, this is a generalizations

I mean, athletic guys (especially team sports player like football player or basketball player) mostly good looking and they are outgoing. Also they show that they care about themselves and put the effort in bettering and preserving their body and physique.

If a girl is working her ass off to be fit and maintain her physique, wouldn't it make sense that she'd expect her potential boyfriend to do the same as well?
