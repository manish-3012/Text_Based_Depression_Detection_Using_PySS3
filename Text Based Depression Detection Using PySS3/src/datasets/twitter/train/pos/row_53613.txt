Please give me some advice for my girl problem  So she and I were friends for quite a long time. Last week I proposed her and she said yes. Yesterday we were close and had a "moment" for kiss. As soon as we were about to kiss I kinda felt weird. Like it felt it wasn't going as I supposed my first kiss would go. Then I freaked out about it and left. So I have some questions like 

1.  Is this normal for everyone? 
2.  Am I other than straight (like gay or asexual)? 
3.  Should I be concerned about it or time will tell me? 

 Also feel free to dm me if you want to know whole story
