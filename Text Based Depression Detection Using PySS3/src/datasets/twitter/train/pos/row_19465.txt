Something u/SumDo0d863 posted about that is similar and annoying Just like them I like to hold doors open for people cos is a nice gesture but more recently I'm noticing people being less and less polite about it like ik it's not expected of you but come on a simple thanks or a smile would be nice is that too much to ask for.
