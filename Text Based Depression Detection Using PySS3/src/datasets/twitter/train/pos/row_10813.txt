some okay advice about homework and procrastination so i've been having trouble with studying and stuff so i'm partially making this post for myself so that it gets through my head better too. if you're reading this, do your homework NOW. but first, tips

tips:

1. if you're struggling to even start homework, count down from 10 and by the time you reach 0, you should do your homework. this method gets easier as you do it more often
2. also do homework distraction free for 1 minute. no videos in the background, nothing. after that 1 minute, you'll start to get into the flow. then start zooming. it's kind of like riding a bike
3. if you want music to ease the pain of studying, make sure it doesn't have any words(like video game soundtracks. vapidbobcat on youtube has amazing long compilations of them) and make sure your music is either in a playlist(like from spotify) or something so that you basically don't have to search for another song every time the music ends every 3 minutes.

that's all. now go do your stuff before it's too late
