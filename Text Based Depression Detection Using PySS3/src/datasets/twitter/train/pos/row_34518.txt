So my favorite bird just passed away He was my little baby, his name was baby...

Sometimes I would go to get him from the birdcage and he wouldnâ€™t want me to, but then I start to pet him and he would fall asleep in my arms.
He was with me for a long time.
He was lonely before we got him, he would mate with his toy...

We then got him another yellow parakeet to be friends with since he loved the color yellow. 

Iâ€™m glad he didnâ€™t die alone!
Iâ€™m glad he was my bird.

I kinda felt like he was going to pass away soon because he hurt his leg and couldnâ€™t walk and his body kinda just stopped, Itâ€™s life though.

Iâ€™m glad I had him, and all of my other birds.
