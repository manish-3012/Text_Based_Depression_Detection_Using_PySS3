I feel so stupid about this First of all: Iâ€˜m 14 years old and I feel like crap because I literally just want someone to care about me. I have a small group of friends and they all care and like me but what I mean is, someone to care about me in a romantic way. Iâ€˜ve never been in a relationship before because I thought it was stupid but now, as time goes by I get lonelier and lonelier even tho I spend time with my friends over discord and can even meet one of them sometimes. 

Donâ€˜t get me wrong, I donâ€™t want a relationship because a lot others in my class had one before. I want one because I never had someone even think about me in this kind of way. I sometimes just catch myself crying whenever I think about couple stuff like cuddling, kisses on the forehead and all of that stuff. 

This all may sound super stupid when a 14 year old says that but it really hurts and I donâ€™t know if it is normal to think that way about relationships in my age. I say so because my classmates that had a partner often just saw it as something funny and silly while I am sitting in my room and crying over the fact that I just want someone to hug me. 

I literally donâ€™t know what to do about this feeling let alone if others think so too. I donâ€™t wanna talk about this with my friends since itâ€˜s embarrassing so yea.. 

god this sounds so stupid.. Thanks for reading through this tho
