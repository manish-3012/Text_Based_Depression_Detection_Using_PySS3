Why do guys think they are ready for relationships?? Like dude youâ€™re insecure about yourself, you donâ€™t even know what you want in a relationship except for titties, and if you canâ€™t even love yourself how can you truly love the person you think youâ€™d wanna be with? But my question is how do you know youâ€™re ready?
