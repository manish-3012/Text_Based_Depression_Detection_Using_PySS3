A few days ago I broke up and since then I feel bad She was the only person I was spending time with. And now I'm all alone. It's so unfair that after everything she has done to me I'm the one who is left alone with no mental help and I'm the one who was hurt and even though she has a courage to post r/im14andthisisdeep type stuff on her insta story and make it all look like if she was the only one hurt
