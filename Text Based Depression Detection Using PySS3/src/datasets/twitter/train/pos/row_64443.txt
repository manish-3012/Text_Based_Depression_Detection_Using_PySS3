I have astrology and the personality shiz a chance theyâ€™re not TOOOTAL bullshit. I definitely identify with some aspects of my astrological sign, Leo. I identify more with my personality type, INFP, though not super strongly. I envy the people who are super connected to all of that and believe wholeheartedly in it. Some of my friends match their signs descriptions pretty well. I know none of its like a science or anything but whatever. I donâ€™t â€œbelieveâ€ in either of em really. I tried em out cuz so many swear by them I figured something had to be there. Which is there is, thereâ€™s a little bit of somethin. Horoscopes are pretty BS tho. Whatever. Iâ€™m tired rn. GOD
