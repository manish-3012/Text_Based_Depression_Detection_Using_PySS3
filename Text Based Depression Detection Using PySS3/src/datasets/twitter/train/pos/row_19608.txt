People say they post pictures for themselves, but I donâ€™t think they are Now this might be a tough pill to swallow especially for girls,but there is no such thing as posting a picture of you or your body for yourself.

People will say they post pictures for themselves and their bodies to say that it empowers them and it makes them feel good. it only really makes you feel good because of the attention you get from posting it.because if you really only wanted your body for yourself then you would look in the mirror, look at yourself and smile and say â€œI donâ€™t need to post anything because Iâ€™m contempt with my self and my bodyâ€. In my opinion self empowerment is just a different way to say external validation. 

If you really posted it for yourself then you wouldâ€™ve left it in the camera roll, the only difference between leaving it in the camera roll and posting it in public is people seeing it, so why post it if youâ€™re doing it for yourself, why do you want people seeing it when youâ€™re doing it for yourself.external validation
