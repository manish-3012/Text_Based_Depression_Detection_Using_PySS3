a rather interesting conversation i was playing a fairly old roblox game earlier, and i was the only one in the sever until this in gig joined. it was a mining game, so he followed my holes and stuff to find me. upon doing that, he proceeds to say â€œsav. you are beautiful.â€ i say â€œuh thanks.â€ â€œhave my offspring.â€ after sitting in shock for a minute, i respond â€œno &lt;3.â€ then he left the game. i donâ€™t know if he was 8 or 40, but it was still really weird.
