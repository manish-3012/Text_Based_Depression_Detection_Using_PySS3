How do I ask her out? I've been talking to this girl online everyday for like 2 months now and she's amazing . Now that college started, I do hang out with her, but get very little time with her alone, as we're always accompanied by friends. On top of that we're both sorta introverted, so it's been hard to progress. When and how should I ask her out?
