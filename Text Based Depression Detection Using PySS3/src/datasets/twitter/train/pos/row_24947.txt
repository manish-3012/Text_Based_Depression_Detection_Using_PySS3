My mom just checked my phone's texts without my permission and then became mad when i asked for some privacy Im absolutely seething. The thing is, i made a new friend from school and my mom has taken upon herself to figure out her "true intentions". 

The funny thing is, just yesterday, mom told me she would never check my texts. When I asked her to give me some privacy, she exploded about how there is no privacy in her house. Moreover she accused me of deleting the chats so she could not see what we were up to.

im pissed off
