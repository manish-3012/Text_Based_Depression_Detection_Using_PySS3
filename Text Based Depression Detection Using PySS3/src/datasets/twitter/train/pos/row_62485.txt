This pisses me off I go to my friends house and hang out sometimes. And while I'm there we talk about things we want... like new computers or phones. His mom listens to everything we say. She somehow turns me saying "im gonna buy MYSELF a new phone" into "these boys always things that we cant afford." Bitch I'm buying it!
