Yay. Emotions. Long story short

I was crying earlier. My dad walked in, I told him to go away. He texted me saying â€œsorry I caught you at a bad time, when class is done you can talk about it after we discuss somethingâ€ I specifically told him I didnâ€™t want to talk about it. So I go downstairs, we talk about chores...

And he brings up my fragile ass emotions. 

I started crying a bit, listening to the BS about talking about my emotions and stuff. Eventually I just stomped upstairs. I went downstairs to talk about CHORES. Not to CRY. And yet he STILL brings up emotions. After I specifically said â€œI donâ€™t want to talk about itâ€

And the worst part is was I wasnâ€™t even crying about anything important. I was literally just panicking because I couldnâ€™t find a super important assignment on my computer.

Donâ€™t try to say â€œoh you can talk to me if you wantâ€ or â€œoh he was just helpingâ€ or â€œyour emotions matterâ€. I just needed to rant somewhere were Iâ€™ll be heard.
