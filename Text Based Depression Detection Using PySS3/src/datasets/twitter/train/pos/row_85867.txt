I'm having this wierd glitch on reddit So for me I have 13,314 karma, pretty average. But whenever I look at it the odd time it will change to either 12,800 or 317. No clue why, I was trying to post something on r/showerthoughts but whenever I did it would quickly change to 300 and wouldn't let me lost for low karma changing back a minute after posting.

Anyone know a reason?
