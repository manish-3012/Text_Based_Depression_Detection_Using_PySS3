Advice about boys from a boy 3: Tokyo drift So I saw the two prior posts about advice from boys(they both nailed it) , so I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring. This is more of a story than a list of advice, but there's still a valuable lesson to share. Anyways, on with the story.

Our tale begins in mid December last year; covid was unheard of, and people were looking to the new year with excitement and optimism.  I was working as a stage crew member of my school's Production. One day, during one of our breaks, I was sitting alone, flicking through my phone mindlessly. A girl, sitting with her friends, called me over. She started asking questions: what my hobbies were, what subjects I did, etc. After a while, I left to do some tasks for a teacher.

At the time, I was really confused as to why she did this- we had barely spoken before. But later that evening I realized: she saw me sitting by myself, assumed I was lonely and called me over. That small act of kindness stuck to me, and I'm certain i'm gonna remember it for the rest of my life. Any time I watch the news and lose hope in humanity, I remember the kindness that that girl showed me.

Moral of the story(This applies to everyone, boys, girls and everyone inbetween): you have no idea how  much a tiny act of kindness can help someone.
