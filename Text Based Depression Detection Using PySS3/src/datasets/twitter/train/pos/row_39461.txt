Can you guys think of any reason a person would pretend to like someone else? Let me be ***far*** more specific. I have been talking to this girl for over a year now. And we have had our fair share of *drama*. Ive liked her almost the entire time, and she has supposedly liked me on multiple occasions also. 

Im not convinced she ever has? Maybe once, but not really. She will do anything to keep our friendship going. And i. Have. No. Idea. Why.

You may be like, isnt that a good thing? But no. I would die for the friendship to keep going and if it was an actual good friendship, but its not. Im always too attached and she always seems to not care. *Until she does*. Whenever you can tell things are really going downhill again, she'll become the version of her i originally liked her for. She answers all the time, seems interested, makes plans, and a few times, admitted she liked me. Weve been a thing for about a week now, and the first few days were absolutely amazing. Wed talk all the time, weve called, watched movies(virtually) and a bunch of other stuff. And then it just went back to completely normal. She doesnt follow on plans, only answers like half of the time shes on her phone, and so on.

I genuinely just can not see a reason of why anyone would do the things she does. Literally? Its like she doesnt care about me at all but does her best to make sure* i* do? She gets nothing out of it? At all? Im hours away. Like literally. She has no reason to. She could just say "ope yup dont like ya, okay", but instead just switches how she seems to feel and think on an hourly basis.

I don't get it.
