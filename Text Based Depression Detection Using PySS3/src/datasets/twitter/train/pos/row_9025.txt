If youâ€™re reading this and you havenâ€™t played Mass Effect, why is that? I donâ€™t know the details but apparently some of you PlayStation people canâ€™t play Mass Effect unless you have a PS3 which is understandable 

But to those who can buy the games or get them from EA Play/Game pass, why have you played the trilogy?

About 2 weeks ago I was very bored and I kept looking at game pass/EA play to see if anything was interesting. I kept going past Mass Effect and at that point, all I knew was that it was an Xbox 360 game and itâ€™s set in space, thatâ€™s it

Without much interest I tried the first game and holy fuck, it got me hooked

Tried the second, first few hours were awful but the game got much better in the last two thirds

Played the 3rd and finished it yesterday, my favourite game of the trilogy (although last 5 minutes sucked)

If youâ€™re reading this and you are able to play Mass Effext Iâ€™m actually begging you to play! The trilogy is amazing and Iâ€™m so grateful I decided to try it out

I know Iâ€™ve gone past posts saying â€œGet this gameâ€ and not bothered but please at least take a look at them, theyâ€™re so good!

Also I heavenly recommend you start at 1, the gameplay is dated but your missing out if you donâ€™t do all 3 in order
