My school's social life is officially ended today I took the defense of my French teacher on the group chat because my classmates said that she never has anything to do and then she expects us to do her homework the day before. I just said how I felt about all this and from now on I expect no one to talk to me anymore and the whole class against me for the next 4 years of high school. thank you for reading my rant
