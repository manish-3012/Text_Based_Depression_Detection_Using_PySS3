This post is just me becoming self aware. I still canâ€™t get over this-

Also sorry for my crap story telling skills, I love writing but rn my brain just bleh

So on Friday on the bus to school, some kid (I only heard their voice) made a â€œIf you ____ ur momâ€™s a hoeâ€ joke (I forgot what the joke was ðŸ˜”) and so I like laughed right? And this 6th grader looks at me so genuinely fucking shocked, and says â€œDid you just **laugh**.â€

Then maybe about a month ago on the bus this kid looked at me and was like â€œDo you talk?â€ and I was like â€œMhmâ€ and he was like â€œOh shitâ€

THEN about three months ago when I was walking to my seat (again on the bus) this one dude in my grade was like â€œYEAH CORYN READY FOR FRIDAY??â€ and I didnâ€™t know how the hell to match this dudeâ€™s energy so I just nod and continue to my seat and this one kidâ€™s like â€œI donâ€™t think sheâ€™s very happy.â€

In conclusion, Iâ€™m JUST now realizing that everyone at my school besides my friends probably think that Iâ€™m a depressed mute kid.
