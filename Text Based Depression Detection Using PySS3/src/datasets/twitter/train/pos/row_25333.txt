It may not seem like I care but it still hurts man... 

   So Iâ€™m Bi and Iâ€™ve already come out to everybody. Everyone took it really well and they all said they had my back and shiz and they still do. Though some have gotten into the habit of using â€œgayâ€ as like a serious insult and a word for like a â€œbadâ€ thing and Iâ€™m like guys Iâ€™m right here. Some even say â€œoh if u donâ€™t do this ur gayâ€ or whatever and Iâ€™m like dude... are you serious?

    Itâ€™s almost like they completely forgot or are ignoring who I am or something. They post stuff into our DC and say â€œGGAAAYYYYYâ€ after it and proceed to wonder why I donâ€™t talk to them much anymore. Like I know these guys care about me I have no doubt in my mind that they do, but show me at least some respect...
