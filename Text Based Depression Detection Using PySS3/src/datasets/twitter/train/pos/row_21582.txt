Instagram is very biased against non-exotic cars **Instagram is very biased against non-exotic cars**

Whenever I try to promote a picture of a nice Toyota Avalon or Lexus ES, it tells me that it's a "prohibited ad" and I don't even mention the price of either car. They say it's based on credit, housing, banking, etc etc. Yet a Ferrari or a Lambo can get promoted within seconds.

FUCK YOU INSTAGRAM!!!
