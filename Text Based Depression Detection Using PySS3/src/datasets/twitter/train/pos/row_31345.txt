god i'm so pathetic i'm in a server with some of my former friends (we drifted away), and it's just awkward. i've only said hi. i physically and mentally can't bring myself to type anything else. they're talking about all these games that i don't know anything about, people i don't know, and about things that happened (i'm not in the same school as them). i feel so pathetic that i'm bringing my problems to reddit, let alone r/teenagers. i want to talk to them but i don't know how to. it's been quite some time so they've changed a lot.
