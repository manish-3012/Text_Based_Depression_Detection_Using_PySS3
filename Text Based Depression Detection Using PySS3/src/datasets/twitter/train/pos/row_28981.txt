Hey guys just wanted to share something... I got a girlfriend now. Me. The fat 218 lbs 17 year old with horrible acne and no visible muscle. I am strong and smart but like I'm nothing I ever thought a girl would like and now I have a girlfriend I'm super confused but also super happy. Just wanted to share that. Also I hope everyone is having an amazing day and remember if you ever need to talk my dms are always open:)
