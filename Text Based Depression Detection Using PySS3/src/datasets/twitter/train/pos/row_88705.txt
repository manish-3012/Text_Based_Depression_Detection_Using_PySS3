I've actual changed so much since last year So last year yeah I was an utter weeb, i watched all those anime. Seen em all naruto, one piece and those smaller series.

Now here I am, don't even watch anime anymore and cringe about the weeb shit I did back then. I think I've grown into a more mature man, though my grades have dropped but to compensate I have focused more on art.
