ok today's the day ive officially officially decided that aesthetically idc if im fat by officially officially i mean it's been in the works of my brain for a while but today i ratified it

i still wanna lose weight for health reasons but like i refuse to 1) base my self-worth on my weight 2) adhere to society's definition of a beautiful body 3) put off loving myself and growing my self-confidence even more "until im skinny"

already feelin like somebody gonna come up in my mentions to tell me "fat is bad ur ugly" umm idc âœ‹ðŸ˜ go get a hobby
