Guess who has to wear a mask at all times ME so now I have to use the passcode on my phone cause Face ID wonâ€™t work and I keep breathing into my eyes oof, not sure if I have covid (probably not) but I have to do this until I get tested,
This wonâ€™t be fun cause I (according to apple screen time) check my phone an avarage of once every 15 minutes
