My dad helped me Lately I've been feeling really bad and my parents noticed it so they tried talking to me but it didn't work. Today I'm in really good mood and my dad came to my room asking me how my weeks been going and all that stuff. He quickly changed the subject to something he's fascinated about which is his work and being cabinetmaker. 
And fuck it was so wholesome listening to him cus he looked really happy when I asked my dad questions or was interested. I'm so happy for him because I know he struggled with depression and is often overworked like man.... I am really lucky to have parents like that and it makes me so proud of him
Idk I feel like he helped me by talking about wood
