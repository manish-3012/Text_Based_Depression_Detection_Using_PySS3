I started watching Ted talks... I've been watching Ted talks since last week and I'm like ," Just one more and then I'll go back to study." Tbh, I didn't expect to get impressed by Ted talks this much. 

So if you know few interesting Ted talks, please let me know.... Also provide the link if you can. :-)
