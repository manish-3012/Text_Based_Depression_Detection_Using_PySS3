Is it normal that I have done much of the normal teenager stuff I have had a crush

I have liked someone

I had sex

I have done interesting shit

I have dated

I have cuddled

Have kissed

Like most teenagers aren't supposed to do I guess?

And I have done many more things I don't know what to include

(And yes, if you're wondering, this is satire, referring to that one post)
