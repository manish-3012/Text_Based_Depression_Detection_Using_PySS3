Had a stressful morning. I had 10 minutes to get to class and I went to usethe bathroom, when I flushed, the toilet overflowed even thought there was nothing non liquid in it. I put a towel under the door and turned off the water, I cleaned up as much as I could and then layed the towel out in the shower. I then, without stepping in anything, left the room to get another towel, I have 3 minutes left. I get the towel and going my room to turn class on, I then clean up everything else with that towel and then layed it out in the shower next to the other one, washed my hands and entered class only 1 minute late.
