Am I overreacting or is this actually stupid? So the other day I asked my parents for a controller to play rocket league on pc, and everytime I try to buy anything (keep in mind, its my money my grandparents give me) they go straight to grades. So in my country, my grades go from 1-5 , every year I get 4s and 5s,last year I got a 3 and they fucking exploded on me, in my sister's grade it goes from 0-20, 16 being the equivilent of a 3 in my grade, she gets a 16, they say its just "a bad day". Is this actually stupid or am I stupid?
