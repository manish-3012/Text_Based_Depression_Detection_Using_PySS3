College is reopening soon. Mixed feelings. In a month. And I donâ€™t know how to feel about it. Itâ€™s gonna be my first semester. Iâ€™ve already been attending the online classes and made some friends as well. But I get this **void in my chest** feeling, like Iâ€™m feeling *things* that Iâ€™m not sure I like. I mean I know I want to leave my home for as long as I remember, but now that itâ€™s getting real, Iâ€™m getting afraid of the *changes* and I think Iâ€™m gonna get homesick a lot which is kinda ironic because from the last two years, itâ€™s been my home thatâ€™s been making me sick. I just hope all goes well.
