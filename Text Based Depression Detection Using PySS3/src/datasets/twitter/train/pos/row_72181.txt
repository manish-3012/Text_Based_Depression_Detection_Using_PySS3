My friend need help but no reddit So he's dating this girl and her parents hate him and blame him for a lot of stuff she does like being depressed, being atheist, and other bs. He's wants to break up with her because he thinks he's a bad influence because she does alot of stuff he does and we are the best teens. And he doesn't because he's afraid she will kill herself. Can you guys help?
