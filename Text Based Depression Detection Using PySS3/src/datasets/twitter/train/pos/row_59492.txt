This is gonna get a lot of hate but needs to be said If you have a crush on someone donâ€™t take it too far, A lot of people have crushes and Itâ€™s normal.However, donâ€™t take it too far. Itâ€™s fun to have a pretend life with a crush but donâ€™t create this fantasy man/woman and feel shattered when it doesnâ€™t pan out. It was never even a real person. Just focus on yourself, and donâ€™t chase someone, if you are chasing someone makes sure itâ€™s like 50/50. If your always thinking about your crush and they definitely arenâ€™t giving you that type of energy then back off, donâ€™t get your heart broken by someone you didnâ€™t date. You can have someone in mind but donâ€™t fall head over heels in love, thinking about them 24/7 thinking about them, dreaming about them when they definitely dont think of you like that, your wasting time, if you chase your dreams girls will come.
