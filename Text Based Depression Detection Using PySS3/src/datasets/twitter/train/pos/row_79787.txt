School is going back in person? (BIG TW) My school is a vocational school. Every other week switches between a week of nothing but your selected shop class, and a week of general academics. We refer to them as Shop Week and Academic Week. (Creative, I know.) I have been bullied since second grade; every friend has left at the start of the new school year, every group Iâ€™m in excludes me, etc. In middle school, I was abused by my first (now) ex-â€œboyfriendâ€ and was bullied to the point of four attempted suicides by him and my â€œbest friendâ€ who Iâ€™ve known since elementary. my other friend Iâ€™ve known since childhood has grown up to be a total fucking dickweed, and his friends are no better. Our school had Academic Week online, but now theyâ€™re trying to reset everything. They want us to go in 5 days (instead of 3-4 like they were doing) and permanently in person. They put out a thing on their website, saying you could fill out a survey to stay at home and do classes from the computer while the teacher runs their class from in the room with the other kids, but my parents arenâ€™t having it. I usually donâ€™t care about little things like this, as due to my disability I cannot understand most major things happening. However, due to my past experiences, my PTSD, and my (albeit mild) Agoraphobia, I canâ€™t do this. I canâ€™t go back, I donâ€™t have the strength. My classmates donâ€™t like me, my friends are terrible, and Iâ€™m... just not strong enough. My parents keep saying â€˜itâ€™s just a few more weeksâ€™, and even though my grades took a minor hit due to not being able to focus, my fibromyalgia has gone down due to not leaving the house. Iâ€™m not afraid to sit with my back away from the wall, because I know Iâ€™m safe. I canâ€™t do these things at school; I need to sit in the back and my fibromyalgia gets so bad that I miss days due to not being able to get out of bed. Iâ€™m honestly just terrified...
