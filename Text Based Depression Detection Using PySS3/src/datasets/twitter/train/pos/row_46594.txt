I feel both under- and overstimulated at the same time The context for me personally might be a bit specific, but maybe others have the same problem as well.

Currently I'm in senior year of high school. Our government arranged it so that seniors are allowed to go to school (to properly prepare for all our exams), but we still have to keep distance. I think it's pretty understandable that you can't keep 20-25 students in one classroom while also keeping distance, so they decided to split classes into two. One group goes to school normally, and the other group follows the same lesson online via Zoom. This switches everyday.

However, I'm not in the group with ANY of my friends. Granted, I don't have many, but I'm not in the group with my best friend, not with my, well, not-so-best friend but a friend nonetheless, not even the person who I would not consider a friend but we talk regularly (but I do like them). I would've accepted being in the group with that person, but no, I'm completely alone!

This all has caused loneliness and stress. Stress because I have to keep track of everything and because of the half-online lessons the quality of the lessons has degraded.

Add to this that my home situation isn't great either. My mom cares way too much about the things that I'm not worried about but doesn't care when I am worried about something. I don't eat healthy, and, I feel anxious of being judged by my parents when I do try it. They probably aren't doing that, but I still feel like it. Personally I'd like to speak with a therapist about everything, but they won't allow me. 

But back to my original problem, I'm lonely, stressed, and bored. I feel like this is the reason why I'm feeling like this, and honestly I'm also not really sure if this is something I am able to get advice on or if I just wanted to rant.
