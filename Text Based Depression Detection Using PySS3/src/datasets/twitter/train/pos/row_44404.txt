Facebook is the Worst Social Media I Have Ever Used. 
Maybe Iâ€™m just thick in the skull, but the layout is so clunky. First time using it. Itâ€™s for my YouTube channel. Someone posted one of my videos and it got 1,500 views so Iâ€™m going to post my videos there.

Itâ€™s SO EASY to find people on it though. Itâ€™s scary.
