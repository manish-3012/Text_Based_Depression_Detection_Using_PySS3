I am starting to hate reddit community Soo I got to know that reposts get a lot of karma so I decided to do so I did my first ever repost on another subreddit to be safe but some as*hole reported me evmthough repostalubot said I was clear but that person reported and banned me for 3 days I was so frustrated and angered other people repost and get shitloads of karma and awards and what do I get..... Frick in suspended I am really annoyed
