I need some advice/help I know this might not seem like the biggest deal to some people but i just want some advice 

So about a month ago a girl i liked asked me out and i said yes. (I am a guy btw 16) I really like her and she is really pretty. Throughout the time we have been dating, I am trying my hardest to be the best boyfriend that i can be. Just always asking her how she is doing and trying to talk to her. 

Thats the problem tho. Trying. Every time i try and talk to her she just seems like she doesnâ€™t care and only gives me like 2 word responses. I try to keep the conversation going but its so exhausting. But in the meantime when we are school she talks to literally every other guy in our friend group. Like openly and right in front of me. Only saying hi when i first see her. Also for a little bit i was in a group chat with all those people and she constantly talked on their but hasnâ€™t opened any of my chats at all. Plus i think she has texted me first one or twice. 

I am just getting the impression that Iâ€™m just a status to her. Like i am her boyfriend, thats it. And not someone who she actually want to hang around or talk to. Like if i were to place me and all the other guys on a tier list or something, i would be at b tier at best. Its just so frustrating. Its so one sided that talking to her is more of a chore then something i like doing. 

She also doesnâ€™t seem to want to do anything either. Like we had our first date like a week after she told me she likes me and we havenâ€™t done anything else. 

I want to talk to her about it but i dont know how and feel like she wouldnâ€™t even try to change something.

I am just so confused and tired of this and i dont know what to do. 

Sorry if this is kinda all over the place but itâ€™s because i am so confused.
