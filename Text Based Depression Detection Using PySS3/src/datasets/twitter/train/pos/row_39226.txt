My dad doesn't get what moving out means So I was talking about moving out and my dad said: "You have to buy a new interior, because you can't move everything back when you are here in the weekends," and I was like: "Who the fuck said I come back in **my** weekends? I'm moving out for a reason, I have better things planned in the weekend than spending it in your dusty enclosure I left for a reason." Wtf thinks he?
