The strangest part is, I've been more depressed before Without a doubt, this is has been the worst year of my life. I haven't hung out with any of my friends in almost a year now, I lost my grandfather, and I'm going to end up failing multiple classes because I don't have any time left to bring them up. But you already know all of that, hell you're probably in a similar situation.

The strangest part is: I still feel pretty okay. And that's an awful thing, because I kinda need that fear to motivate me to do what I need to. but my apathy makes that really hard. I can think back to times where my life was overall not bad, but I was still pretty depressed. Idk it just seems weird (and kinda scary) that I was depressed then but not now, when the world id burning around me and my future is crumbling in front of me.
