Scariest Experience in Class I was a Freshman at the time (Sophomore now) and I was in Independent Study I think.  
Now I can't remember exactly what I said, but I do remember it was a joke about race.  
A couple of (African American) kids heard it and threatened to "Jump me" after school.  
Instead, I payed them off but apparently that wasn't going to help me...  


At some point an (African American) kid walked up behind me while I was writing something.  
He put his hands around my neck and started strangling me for a good 10-20 seconds there.  
Right in front of a few classmates (who did nothing) and literally during a supervised class.  
The teacher didn't notice and I never reported it because I knew I would get into trouble too.
