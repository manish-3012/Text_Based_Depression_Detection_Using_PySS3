So help me out here My dad decided to take a monitor that I was using outside and put it on an elevated surface so he could watch tv and smoke cigars at the same time ( the American dream). Naturally, wind existed and tipped it over and broke it. Iâ€™m trying to get him to buy me a new one or at least help me pay for a new one. He wont, he hasnâ€™t even said sorry yet. I donâ€™t understand. Any tips on how to get him to buy me a new one???
