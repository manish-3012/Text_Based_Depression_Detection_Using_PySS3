This is actually my life plan. I'm going to try to graduate high school, but I fail more than once, I'll move on. I'll work manual labor because that's all I'm good for, maybe for the Amish if they'll take me, it will make me strong. I'll save enough for a boat at least 30ft long, good for long distance sailing, I'll find at least 4 other crazy/desperate people to join me. We'll sail to Africa, we'll fight the warlords, we'll unite some tribes, or maybe amass a large fleet of boats. We'll help the common people, we'll plunder the precious metal and jewel mines and give the people around us better lives. It's a mess, and I'm sorry it's that way. Thanks for reading this. It's dumb, but even if I die, I'll die fighting and trying to make my name great.
