Pointless opinion about colors I noticed that I when I say I like a specific color I hardly ever mean the â€œstandardâ€ color like when I say I like red I donâ€™t mean the bright almost oppressive red I mean Maroon perhaps Burgundy or when I say green I mean Jade or Turquoise just some food for thought I suppose 

Yes this post has not relevance and yes Iâ€™m up at 5 am thinking about fucking colors
