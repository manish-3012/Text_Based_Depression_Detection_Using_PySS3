Do nekos count as furries? Because, like, a neko is basically a human with animal-like features, such as a tail or ears, but, like, a furry is basically just an animal with human-like features, such as opposable thumbs, and the ability to walk, so I'm beginning to think they're one and the same and should be classified as such, so people don't get confused. I've just been kind of thinking about this all day and wanted some sensible people to end my debate.
