Advice from a boy about boys. As a boy I see so many girls with no clue how to talk to boys. Here are my top tips about how to treat them.


~Never give them up.

~Never let them down.

~ Never run around and desert them.

~Never make them cry

~Never day goodbye

And most importantly,

Never tell a lie, and hurt them.
