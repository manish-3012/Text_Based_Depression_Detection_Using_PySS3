My moms nostalgia I was talking to my mom about games were nostalgic about, she started going over the games she played as a kid on an old Commodore 64 with so much passion, we watched YouTube videos of gameplay and she just sat there while asked a question and she didnâ€™t even here me. Her eyes were wide and glistening with joy. A few minutes later she said â€œthis brings back interesting memoriesâ€ in a tone that Iâ€™d never heard from her before. Itâ€™s been like 10 minutes since that interaction and Iâ€™m crying, why is nostalgia so painful, it physically hurt me to see that even though I know she was happy. Sheâ€™ll never be that nerdy frizzy haired girl playing old games all day anymore, one day thatâ€™ll be me. That hurts man, that hurts
