I think my crush might like me but I also think she might be lesbian Im friends with her and so is another one if my friends, anyway, my friend told me that she likes me, but that could be him trying to hipe me up. Also as the title said, I think she might be gay, or hopefully bi. Last year she had a boyfriend, that she broke up with, but later on, towards the end of the year, I saw her holding hands and kissing girls. So I'm really confused and bit sure if I should shoot my shot and I'm a lil nervous about the it.

TL;DR: I think my crush is lesbian, but my friend says she likes me
