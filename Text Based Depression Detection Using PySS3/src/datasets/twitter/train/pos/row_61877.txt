How do I know if i really like someone? Hi, I never had any type of relationship and I'm socially awkward(Wow I'm on Reddit) and now I feel like I have a crush on this girl, but I don't really know if this is love or if I just want someone by my side or if I just want a relationship. She was in my class a few years ago, but back then it wasn't like this. Also, there's this Covid Situation and I don't feel comfortable meeting in Person with her when it's only the 2 of us. Now I don't know, what I should do... Both of us are 16 rn and none of my friends had been a good help. If somebody can help me here would be cool. Thanks in advance
