Dear everyone that mocks us cause we wear the stuff we like Yes, I daily wear yeezys and more expensive brands of clothing, sometimes formal clothing, but I am not rich, and it doesn't mean you can just mock somebody saying their Rich and stuff, it's our preferred clothing, and for me, this mostly comes from my grandparents, who are amazing and always buy us clothing, but no, we are not rich, we do not like in a 1 million dollar home, no, we don't drive a Ferrari, we drive a 2013 Honda Civic, and no, we dont wear stuff just to say LOOK AT ME IM RICH, I wear this stuff because I like the looks of it, it's comfortable, and also, don't try to become friends with us just because it seems like we have money, and then not ever talk to us again when you come over to our 1 bedroom apartment.
