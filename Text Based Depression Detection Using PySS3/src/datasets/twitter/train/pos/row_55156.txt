Surpassing Lucas after party Lucas: "Sis, yesterday's party was lit! We were with four chicks in one car! I swear it!" 

Me: "Bro, I was yesterday with dudes!" 

Lucas: "How many?" 

Me: "200! 200 dudes." 

Lucas: "Sis, sis..."

Me: "I swear it!"

Lucas: "That doesn't even fit!"

Me: "We were 200 dudes, in one car! In one car, Lucas!"
