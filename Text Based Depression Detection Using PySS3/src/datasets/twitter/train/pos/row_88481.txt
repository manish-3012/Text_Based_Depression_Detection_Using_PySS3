Depression notes Like I tried so fucking hard like always snapping her and talking to her and trying to help her when she wasnâ€™t feeling good and telling her whatâ€™s best or when sheâ€™s fucking crying and Iâ€™m literally asking her friends if she is ok after texting her and snapping her to make sure she is ok. Or the endless support and help I give her like a 3 am drunk ft to talk to me and me trying to help her and her saying she missed me and since she is drunk she says shit that she hides when sober and me showering her in fucking compliments everyday, today I have alr said she looks good and that she is cute like I donâ€™t know what to do like I carry convos and never have a dry one and never let one become dry or I always try to tell her that she is perfect in every way even when she is crying about being fat or not pretty or not this or that and me always being there helping her and her saying that she couldnâ€™t believe that I was a nice guy and constantly tried to ignore that I was someone who helps her and never leaves her side or talks behind her back like Iâ€™m fucking done I have tried so fucking hard I have done every thing I possibly can do I have never wanted to be with someone so bad and if I try to go for someone else it wonâ€™t be the same or the person I want to be with sheâ€™s the only one I like talking to and the only one I like to be around she makes me happy for once the one person that has made me happy is her I never thought I would want someone so bad like it fucking hurts man I have tears in my eyes rn writing this to try and feel better, try and ignore the fact that I will never be able to suppress this feeling.
