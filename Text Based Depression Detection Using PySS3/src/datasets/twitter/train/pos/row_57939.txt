Is this normal? Through the last few years I've been attracted to quite a lot of people, taking my shots that I could. I've been super active and socializing. But recently for the last month it feels like a part of my brain shut off and I dont feel attracted to people anymore. It feels like a sudden shutdown and I'm wondering If that's normal. I'm 15 m, wondering if anyone knows. Sorry if this doesnt make sense, I'm tired
