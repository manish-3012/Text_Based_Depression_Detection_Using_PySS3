Dudes, how do I ask you for a hug? (Outside of the Pandemic) (Quick backstory here, 

School started again and I *think* I just caught feelings for this one dude (havenâ€™t had feelings for someone for about over half a year) and he just makes me feel happy, safe, calm and just peaceful and he basically makes me feel things I forgot I could because itâ€™s been a really long time since Iâ€™ve had a crush like this (+/- 3-4 yrs.))

AND I really want to hug him, but I canâ€™t because of the pandemic and the fact that Im not really an out of the blue hugger. I have no idea how to approach the hug/continue it)

Thatâ€™s basically all Iâ€™ve been thinking about the last few days. *I just want him to hug me/vice versa* 

Iâ€™m kind of wondering whenever I get the chance, are there some major dos and some major donâ€™t whenever I (approach you to) hug (you)? (After the pandemic has cooled down a tad more ofc) 

Im very sorry if this is poorly written.

TLDR; What are some doâ€™s and donâ€™t whenever I (want to) hug you? 

I just kind of want to be ready if weâ€™ll even ever have our first hug.
