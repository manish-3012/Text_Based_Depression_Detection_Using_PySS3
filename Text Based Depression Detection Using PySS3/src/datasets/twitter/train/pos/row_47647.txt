People call you sociopaths for the simple reason of Laughing at tragedies. Sincerely, nowadays news channels portrait them as tragical comedies. Like when a building went down and the person jumped out of it trying to survive. Or... when a water tank rolled over 5 people and a car just turned to the other street.

Really, that doesn't necessarily make you a sociopath. After all, sociopaths are turned into sociopaths. Some people are just Psychopaths

Some dark humour for y'all
