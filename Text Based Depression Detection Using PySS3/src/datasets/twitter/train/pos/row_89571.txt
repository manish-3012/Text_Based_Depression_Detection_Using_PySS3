My state just passed a bill that bans abortion at the moment of conception. So pretty much when you have sex itâ€™s illegal to get an abortion any time after that. No matter if itâ€™s incest or rape. The woman is legally required to have the baby. This makes me fucking sick. I hate my state with all my heart.
