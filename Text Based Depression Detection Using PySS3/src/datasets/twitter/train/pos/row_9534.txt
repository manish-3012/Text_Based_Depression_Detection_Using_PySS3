Why is the milk gone? Why did you forgot to buy milk ?
Well that's the interesting question.
See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house, however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house. So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last 5 year and the have this new 45% alcohol apple flavor vodka, Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so, really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it's been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it's only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations. So, really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about 4 billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth . But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang, billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing 14 billion years ago.
So if that the case, Did the universe always knew that ? 14 billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem, single cell life , complex organisms, humans, human society, domestication of cows, the invention of coffee, milk in coffee, fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk 14 billion years later. 


Well, maybe If You're playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right ? It's all predetermined. If you take the same shot 1000 times the outcome will be the same 1000 times, well if the Big Bang happens 1000 time over just the way it it did 14 billion years ago, would you run out of milk a 1000 times 14 billion later ?! And doesn't that mean that you're life is already determined ?! Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way, just that way,just like a pool game ?



No, definitely not. We've got free will, right ?



I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn't mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system, you can still just decided to do stuff, right ?

BECAUSE IF NOT THEN, WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL... MEANING WE'RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE. DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE'RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU'VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN'T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE. AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND - FUCK IT, FUCK MILK black coffee is fine.
