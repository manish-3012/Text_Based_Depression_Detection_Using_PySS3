You know how weird it is to be happy? I made someone happy and now Iâ€™m on top of the world. I also helped this person and am fucking overjoyed. I just got up and ate food and I donâ€™t feel like shit because of it. Itâ€™s really weird and Iâ€™m in such an awesome mood. I hope everyone else is in this mood.
