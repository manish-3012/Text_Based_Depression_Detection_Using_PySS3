I fucking hate my parents so much sometimes Sometimes I hate my parents so much. They just canâ€™t let me be my own person. If I ever do something I want to do (this includes talking about my interests) they criticise me and tell me how useless I am (not directly, but itâ€™s so obvious).

The moment Iâ€™m not a little pretty perfect girl Iâ€™m lazy, rude and aggressive in their eyes. Sure I might not be the most active person ever, but Iâ€™m an athlete compared to some of my friends. Why do my parents always compare me so much? Itâ€™s really annoying. Why canâ€™t I just be myself for a moment?

And they wonder why I spend so much time online.

I donâ€™t know what to say, honestly. Sometimes I hate them so fucking much and sometimes a love them. 

Why am I like this..?
