Boys, we are to weak The other day two girls were talking with me, I knew one but not the other. The one I knew was telling the other about how I had hacked the school webpage and it didn't let anyone enter for 2 hours. And the way she looked at me, like amazed or something like that while smiling, made me develop an instant crush.
Girls, be careful, you don't understand the effect that a simple smile can cause on us.
