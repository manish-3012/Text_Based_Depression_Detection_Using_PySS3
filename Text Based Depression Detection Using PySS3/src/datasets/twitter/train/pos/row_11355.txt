I almost suicided Ifdk what is happening in my life, m so confused but i am pretty sure i am an ASSHOLE. I almost cut my nerves and then my mom suddenly walks in and luckily my mom dint see the knife :( 

I hate my life, i am a loner and i wanted a pet so that i could stay happy and then my parents are like NO because they hate animals

I asked them for a pc for my bday but then they are like my eyesight is weak, and using pc would reduce my eyesight more 

And then my family only loves those 2 bitches (my elser sisters) who are the reason for me to attempt suicide because they make me feel depressed all the time. So i got rejected from my crush and i wanted to forget her and my sisters saw my chats with her and they told everyone in my family that i got rejected and my whole family started teasing me, if i ask anything from my parents my sisters just say the disadvantages on me and my parents say NO for everything i want. And now i feel they no more love me because they scold me for no reason and just use me as a servant. 

Thank for reading this and ik that u would feel that was attempting suicide for cringe reasons but i am a very emotional person. Whatever bad happens to me makes me attempt suicide. And everytime i try to suicide something interrupts me or i dont get the guts to do so :(

And now i only want to do is suicide. My life is fucking SHIT
