It's hot, I'm feeling hot, my mind is in flames I'm hot - it's 34Â°C

I'm feeling hot - my blood sugar is fucking high, so I just might as well fuck it up even more with ice cream

My mind is in flames - I fear about school, stuck with my family and I'm expected to socialize, I still think about killing somebody, or me, I think about cutting everytime I see a knife, I just want to throw up every food I ate, or just eat nothing at all, I don't wanna be fat (even when my grandma told me I look skinnier, thanks gram &lt;3)

And how is your evening/noon/morning/night going?
