Why are people not smart? So at my school, we are doing debate projects and I was quarantined for 2 weeks so I had to catch up. So my topic was about free speech on the internet and I said it's fine for people to say whatever. I was the only person who chose that out of the group while the rest said that you can't say whatever you want. Now we were debating on it and they said that Free Speech causes terrorism and said that Facebook allows terrorist recruits. I had to explain to them that that's Facebook's problem and if they were controlled by the government, it wouldn't exist because they would incite violence. Plus terrorists have found other ways to communicate. Thank God that the majority agreed with me but one of them still try to make the argument that apparently I'm racist even though she says that Irish people don't deserve a holiday. What is wrong with this world
