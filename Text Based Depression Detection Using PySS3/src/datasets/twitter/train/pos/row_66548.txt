I dont know if this girl likes me or not It's my first year in a new high school and I have made a good amount of friends. Then one day, in my creative writing class 5 minutes before the bell rang, a girl just walked up to me and asked me how my day was. I had never met her before but she was being super friendly. We talked for a little bit and then the bell rang. 

2 days later, in that same class (this is the only class we have together), the whole class went on a walk around the campus to look for imagery. We walked next to each other the whole time and talked a lot. I think I'm the only boy she's been this nice to. She even calls me out when she's talking to her friends. Earlier today I was waiting for my ride to come, and she walked by with her friends. Here's how our conversation went. 

Her:"OMG is that Ben (me) hi Ben!".

Me: Hey

Her: See you in creative writing on Monday!

Me: See ya

Her: See ya!

So... Yeah. Just so you know, I do like her. She has a great personality and is really cute. So people of reddit, what do I do?
