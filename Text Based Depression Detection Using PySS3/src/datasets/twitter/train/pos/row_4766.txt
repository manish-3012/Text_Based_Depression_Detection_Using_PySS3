Problem with a very old friend So I've been friends with someone for a very long time (since primary), being all the time with her, but as time passed, I felt that the friendship has been kinda dying, especially this year. We had nothing in common, and whatever I had wasn't interesting for her, so our conversations were very bland and awkward.

I have this thing that I don't respond very frequently to people, or feel insecure when starting a conversation even if they're my best friend, and she has been the only one who felt really hurt by it, saying that it harmed her mental health. We've had this discussion 3 times already, and I can't seem to change for some reason. 

Now being quarantined I talked even less to her, considering the fact that we could only talk though social media. Slowly I've been making new friends, and I eventually stopped talking to her. Today, MONTHS later (I know I still feel bad about it) since our last conversation, I decided to talk to her, only for this discussion I previously mentioned to happen again. 

I just feel that our friendship has already sailed, but I can't say that to her. She is now very angry at me. It's of course understandable, but I can't just say sorry now, it's not the first time.

Well, what I wanted to ask was: what should I do?
