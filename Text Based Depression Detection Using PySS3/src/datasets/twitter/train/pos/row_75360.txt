I play video games on my mac, can I still be accepted in society? A year ago I changed my computer from a really shitty lenovo that would take 10 mins to start up and would freeze too often to a mac, but at that time I didn't play any games cuz I wasnt allowed to but I intended on playing them sometime later, but I didn't know that mac arent really gaming pcs lol. I'm still not allowed to play video games cuz they cAusE ViOleNcE and are DiStRacTiNg to StUdiEs, but I just dont create a desktop shortcut so that my parents won't find out if they ever see my desktop. Lol idk how to tell people irl that I play games and then they find out that theyre on my mac. I dont wanna get bullied hah.
