Parents should be required to leave when doctors are asking questions This isnâ€™t just about the â€œare you sexually activeâ€ question, although it is part of it. Itâ€™s also about doing the anxiety and depression sheets. I had to do them a while ago and I felt really uncomfortable because my mom was right next to me. She did ask me if I would be more comfortable if she left, but I didnâ€™t make her leave. Thatâ€™s why I think it should be required. So kids donâ€™t have to tell them to leave. I do have severe anxiety and mild depression if you were curious. Iâ€™m taking meds for it.
