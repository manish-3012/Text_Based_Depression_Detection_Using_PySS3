17F I kinda just need someone to listen to me. Iâ€™m too afraid to burden my irl friends because they are going through their own shit too. Iâ€™ve just been going through a lot lately, and itâ€™s mentally taking a toll. Nothing too serious but itâ€™s affecting my whole mood. As Iâ€™m sure every other teenager feels out there. Anyways, if you have the time and space for a little bit Iâ€™d appreciate it. And even if you donâ€™t some well wishes would be nice :)
