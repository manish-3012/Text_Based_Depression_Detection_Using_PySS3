Ok so...  There's this girl who I've kinda had a crush on for a while at school. I have her number in my phone because we once had a school project together. Today I heard her say that she wished anyone in the world liked her, and if somebody did, she would take them. I want to text her something, but I don't know what. I have no experience in this field, so I came here.
