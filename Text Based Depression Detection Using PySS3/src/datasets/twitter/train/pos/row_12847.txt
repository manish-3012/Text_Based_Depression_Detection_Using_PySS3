Update on my porn/masturbation problem #3 Itâ€™s not easy, but Iâ€™m making progress. Iâ€™ve won a few battles, but I havenâ€™t won the war.

Iâ€™ve also learned few more things.

-One part of winning over addiction is a distraction (working out, playing videogames..). It helps (but not prevents) that need to do it.

-The second part is the will to stop. If you donâ€™t have that, you wonâ€™t stop.

It has been also harder to resist the urge. Mainly because I have the virus and I had to stay all day home for two weeks.

Iâ€™ll maybe post another update soon.
