All of my friends are ghosting me I've been in quarantine for a full year now. My family and I have been taking it really seriously. I didn't have very many friends to begin with, I was in a group chat with about 8-9 people. But I went and said some stupid shit and now they all hate me. 

The thing that makes this worse is that these people were my only friends for almost 3 years now. And since I caught the virus and I'll be going back to school once I'm healthy and immune, I won't have anybody to talk to once I'm there. 

I'm mildly autistic and very introverted, but I still need to be around people. I don't know what to do, can someone please help me?
