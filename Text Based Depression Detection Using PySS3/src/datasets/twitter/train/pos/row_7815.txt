Holy fucking shit this is the most pissed off I've ever been about something I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do for this dumbass question on my test because the fucking curriculum wasn't explained in the class and now I'm gonna fucking fail this class

'a diver runs and drives out horizontally from the edge of a vertical cliff and reaches the water below. the diver hits the water 9.0 m from the base of the cliff and the cliff has a height of 31 m above the water. (a) how long does it take for the diver to hit the water? (b) how fast was the diver running just before diving off the edge? (c) find the horizontal and vertical components of the diver's velocity just before the diver hits the water?'

If anyone is in or has passed high school fucking physics and wants to explain how IN THE FUCK I'm supposed to do this please feel free to do so, I'm about to flip my fucking shit
