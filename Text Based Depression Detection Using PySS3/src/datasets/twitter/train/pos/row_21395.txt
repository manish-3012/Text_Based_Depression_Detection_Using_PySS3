Iâ€™m nervous about school In my country, half of the class goes to school for a week and then the other half goes the following week. It works like this.

Iâ€™m going present next week, but Iâ€™m nervous because we have so many tests I just want to cry. We have math, english, italian and biology class; and then also history and biology oral tests. I think I want to cry.
