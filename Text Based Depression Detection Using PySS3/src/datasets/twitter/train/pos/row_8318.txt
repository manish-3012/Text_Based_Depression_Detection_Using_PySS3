School grades Ok so as the title says, this year was a cluster fuck for me and maybe most of yâ€™all.  I went to a former A and B honor roll student to getting 3 fâ€™s in 3 semesters.  I wanted to see if any of yâ€™all knew if that would get me held back.   Iâ€™m picking the grades up now considering stuffs dying down where I live.   My previous thoughts was that you were only held back if you had more than 2 fâ€™s at the end of the fourth semester.
