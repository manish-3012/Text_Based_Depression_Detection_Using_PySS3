My friend who smokes weed might be trying Nicotine soon and they wonâ€™t listen to reason So my stupid ass friend smokes weed Occasionally and Iâ€™m completely fine with it. Iâ€™m not gonna freak out on them for smoking weed even if itâ€™s technically harmful for us still. So their dealer is gonna let them try vaping sometime soon and they are down for it.

So the reason they want to try vaping is because â€œhey I have a bad life and if it makes me feel good Iâ€™m fine with it and I know the consequencesâ€. So being the good friend that I try to be I told basically told them â€œhey you probably shouldnâ€™t do that dumbassâ€. Since, ya know, I donâ€™t want my friend loosing their life to drugs (metaphorically). This may sound dumb to some of you out there but I can see why they might think this way and I can also see why this might make them try worse drugs. So what Iâ€™m basically asking is am I the bad guy here for trying to save my friend from a bad life of drug addiction?
