A message to most teenagers: Youâ€™re probably ignorant, act like it, itâ€™s okay to be ignorant, you just need to know you are not knowledgeable and learn and youâ€™re fine.

No you â€œcan go to the bathroom at anytime without asking because itâ€™s my houseâ€ the teachers will get blamed if youâ€™re not there, thatâ€™s just an example.

You should do that and know not everything will be true, usually are but there are bound to be wrong facts, including you own.

Listen to elders, obviously there are exception, a lot, but itâ€™s not everyone, if you think an adult is lying ask other adults, and more.

Donâ€™t be childish and act like the opposite of this, so much people are unnecessarily rebellious.

I feel really old acting like this, but Iâ€™m 15 not a 35 year old man, and even if I was I would still be right.

Before you say it, Yes, There ARE exceptions, just know theyâ€™re a lil rare, if I get murdered tomorrow then itâ€™s probably this post, detective, thanks.
