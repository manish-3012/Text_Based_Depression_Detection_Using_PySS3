I want to be able to swim. Yeah, so I was terrified of water from a young age because of a couple of negative experiences (I also despise the feeling of water getting up your nose)

And my lack of swimming ability doesn't come from a lack of trying, either. I've taken numerous lessons over the last 8 years, most of which were related to school or church. However, there was one thing that was holding me back each time:

They expected you to already know how to swim.

Every single time I'd show up they'd expect me to know, or worse, they'd have me go in the deep end and just go for it, citing "The fear will motivate you"

It didn't, btw. 

And I've decided I'm sick of being the guy that clung to the wall at pool parties, or failed every swim test he took.

I asked my parents about looking for a private instructor, since their attempts at teaching me hadn't worked out very well. Plus, I don't like the idea of being watched by my entire family during the learning process, its very nerve-racking. Every time I've tried learning in public its ended terribly (At one event they even asked me to be the dummy so they could practice saving a drowning swimmer),

My parents seemed to take offense to this, because they thought they could do a better job. 

I should also emphasize that the only member I was able to make ANY progress with was my 76 year old grandmother, and even that was miniscule at best. Plus, if anything began happening to me, I don't have faith in her ability to act as a lifeguard.

It's just a frustrating situation, since at 14 (15 in a couple weeks), its hard to ask for help with swimming without ridicule "Why didn't you learn when you were younger" or "What would happen if we threw you into the ocean right now?

Is it really this unusual to be unable to swim at this age? I've been given different answers and I'd like to know that I'm at least not alone.
