Guys Iâ€™m on campus and itâ€™s so fuckin cold My room has bad heating. The past three days Iâ€™ve barely gotten up and shivered in bed. I wear a coat indoors. Itâ€™s gonna be a snowstorm tonight. Well, at least now I know how poor people feel, how they actually are concerned of the weather. Finna freeze tonight lol ðŸ¥¶
