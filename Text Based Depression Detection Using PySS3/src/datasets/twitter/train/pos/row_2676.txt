I did not noticed how long it took me I just spend over 3 hours building a lego car, that's doesn't even look good, its a homemade one but still, wtf why did it take me form 10pm to 1am ?? HOW? I could make a damn space shuddle in 45 minutes (yes its true) but it took me 3 hours to build one small car????? 
anyways my life is a meme, se ya
