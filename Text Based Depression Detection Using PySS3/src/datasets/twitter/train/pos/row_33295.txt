Iâ€™m gonna miss 2020 so much :( This was honestly the most amazing year of my life. Besides Donald Trump losing the election, Iâ€™ve had such an amazing year. Iâ€™ve been thriving in online school and Iâ€™ve made so many new friends. Iâ€™ve been meeting up with my friends nearly every week of the year. Iâ€™ve been able to travel, go to church, go to concerts and large parties, etc. Iâ€™m gonna miss 2020 so much.
