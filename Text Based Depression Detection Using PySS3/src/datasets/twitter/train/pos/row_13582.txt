Ayo watch this please, and if you like murder ballads are creepy stuff this is for you :) [acid king by Aesop rock](https://youtu.be/dzieBpafT2o)

here are the lyrics and are kinda cryptic but if you understand it's very dark

The magic is black  
Backyard happy and fertile  
For Kasso the acid king of the black circle  
Same year Bowie dropped, two horns hatched and matured  
To gore Northport's '84  
Here is '84: Mary Lou Retton, Excitebike, AIDS, Jeopardy!  
Wake up the Orwell in me  
Crack rock, anyway, seventeen summers in developing  
Would it be the middle school or ketamine, guess  
Left home in the dark, to curl up in a bear hug in Suffolk county's arms  
With a bevy of heavy metal records and leather bibles  
More Anton LaVey than Saint Michael  
More sherm in a Ford on bricks behind Midas  
Fly with the pentagram pilot  
Sabbath and Judas and all tunes prudent  
Seems tame now, but then it was devil music  
Rick six, the nickname clicks  
Makeshift altar in a clearing in the sticks  
Forfeit a kitten by the forks from the kitchen  
With horsemen who drew the same symbols  
Pitchforks waving out a grand theft four by four support system, alas  
Angus on the ax in the back  
Foreground offering a pitch-dark animal corpse and backyard black mass  
And a brash curiosity opt for grave robbery  
To puff and pluck skulls at a cemetery property  
Cops cuff him and stuff him in Amityville Asylum  
It's fantasy island for Noah's Lions, at the time  
South Oaks, but focus on the environment  
And how it couldn't loosen the Lucifer out his client who would flee  
Pale moon, pale horse howling death  
And LSD to make it mean more than it meant  
Pay attention, here's where the whole thing sours  
And goes from intrigue into wowzers  
At a party, a passed out drunk Kasso gets got for ten bags of dust  
Now it's not a big town, and people are big mouths  
So he fishes around 'til he figures it out  
Gary Lauwers, seventeen years young  
You have no idea what you've done  
Track him down, beat him pissy  
He got five bags back, still owes him fifty  
Oh Ricky, Ricky, do we hound him for loot,  
Or show him how the hellbound do? Hm  
Kasso waives all debts, says "Let's just go and get baked instead"  
Two shake hands and the beef play dead  
Though it's more like a skeeter shaking a web  
And along came a spider with two of his friends  
It was into the woods, a delusional mess  
Four kids dipped in a black hole bath  
June 16, Kasso snaps  
Off-guard Gary tackled and pinned  
Sees Rick pull a knife from his jacket and grin  
Raise that knife like a sword to the moon  
Plunge that knife through a portrait of youth, going  
"Say you love Satan, say you love Satan"  
Lauwers ain't say it, just cave to the face lift  
Thirty-two stab wounds, gouged out eyes  
Burns on his skin, not a cloud in the sky  
Kasso had later explained he was told by Satan himself in the form of a crow  
To murder the kid cold, a part of a pristine whole  
No, no, no, no, no  
And just had to brag, until somebody sad just had to rat  
Sat in the cell is a merchant of hate,  
Who would hang from his sheet before the third day  
Some say Kasso was part of a cult,  
But I'm sure there was more than we're told  
More than adults and authority could rightly decode  
Or maybe I'm wrong and he's finally home  
Kasso  
It's starting to feel like a nice night  
Hold close to the highs and the white light  
Hold close to the good you are drawn to  
These woods were grown to disarm you  
It's starting to feel like a nice night  
Hold close to the highs and the white light  
Hold close to the good you are drawn to  
These woods were grown to disarm you  
It's starting to feel like a nice night  
Hold close to the highs and the white light  
Hold close to the good you are drawn to  
These woods were grown to disarm you  
It's starting to feel like a nice night  
Hold close to the highs and the white light  
Hold close to the good you are drawn to  
These woods were grown to disarm you
