I have a question for y'all straights So my friend got himself a girlfriend and I'm happy for him till he calls me up in the middle of the night sounding like the opposite of sober and laughing while saying titty over and over. When I finally get him to explain he says that he saw his girlfriend's boob and then goes back to the whole laughing thing. So my question is. Is that how y'all normally react?
