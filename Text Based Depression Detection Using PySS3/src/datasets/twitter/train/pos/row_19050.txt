My dog just died The dog I had for about 7 years, a Shi Tzu, passed away recently.

I was playing in the backyard with my little sister and him when the ball we were passing around bounced off. Cookiey (my dog), ran to get it and bumped it farther. At that point we were a bit worried, but he let him go a bit more.

Unfortunately we live right near the road, and by the time we figured he would go too far it was too late. A car hit him.
