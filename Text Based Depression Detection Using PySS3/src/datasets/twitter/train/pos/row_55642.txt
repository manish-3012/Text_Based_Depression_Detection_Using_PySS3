I'm actually braindead I heard a few times that Keanu Reeves was in the Matrix movies (I've watched all three) and each time I try to think back to try to remember what character he was and failing each time. I kept thinking "maybe he just made a small cameo" 

I only found out now he played Neo. Fucking Neo. The main character of the whole franchise. Jesus Christ
