I got rejected for the first time in my life and I'm sad I've always been terrified of declaring my feelings, so I never did until a few days ago. I already expected a no but I wanted to hear it so I could move on. What I didn't expect was for him to start to be a complete jerk with me when just a week ago we got along so fucking well. I'm more sad about the friendship I lost then anything. And now I guess my fear of rejection is even worse
