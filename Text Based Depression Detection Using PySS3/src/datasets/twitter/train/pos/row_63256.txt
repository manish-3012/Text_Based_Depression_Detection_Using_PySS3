Anyone wanna chat? DM me :)))))) The name "flamingo" comes from Portuguese or Spanish flamengo, "flame-colored", in turn coming from ProvenÃ§al flamenc from flama "flame" and Germanic-like suffix -ing, with a possible influence of the Spanish ethnonym flamenco "Fleming" or "Flemish". The generic name Phoenicopterus (from Greek: Ï†Î¿Î¹Î½Î¹ÎºÏŒÏ€Ï„ÎµÏÎ¿Ï‚ phoinikopteros), literally means "blood red-feathered" has a similar etymology to the common name[2]; other genera include Phoeniconaias, which means "crimson/red water nymph (or naiad)", and Phoenicoparrus, which means "crimson/red bird (though, an unknown bird of omen)".
