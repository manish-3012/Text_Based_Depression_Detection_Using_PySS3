I just stomached my inner-elitism, and I'm proud of that fact So earlier today, I walked in on my older brother watching Sword Art Online. For those who aren't that heavy into anime, SAO is kinda infamous for being a terrible show with really sloppy writing, I mean, just terrible writing throughout the board. I've been trying to get him into anime for years before he left for college, and so it physically hurt my soul that he was finally watching it, but it was SAO. But as such, I understood that the best thing for him would probably be to make him feel good enough about watching SAO that he'd be inspired to seek out much better anime when he finished.

I stomached my inner-elitism and cringy otaku snobbiness, and pretended like SAO was a good show against all my better judgment. It damaged my very being, but I sucked it up for the sake of nurturing a new interest within my brother.
