Remember the anti-drug propaganda they used and in some places still do force feed us? I remember in 4th grade I had this health teacher, Mr.Jackson but we called him Mr Hippie because well, he was a hippie. We were going over drugs, and how they can affect you, he was supposed to just say â€dRuGs BaDâ€ but he didn't he taught us the benefits and dangers of each drug and for that, he got 3 months suspension and when he came back he got demoted to an assistant teacher to my new health teacher, Mrs.Kambell. Anyway, my point here isn't that drugs are perfect because they're not, I'm just saying that every drug has its ups and downs but so does everything that can ever exist. Tell people that they can do drugs because â€dRuGs BaDâ€ is empty and kind of patronizing. If you notice that someone needs help with a drug problem, help them, if they're completely fine just leave them alone, please.
