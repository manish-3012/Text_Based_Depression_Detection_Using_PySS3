So I really want to talk to my crush but have no clue what to say. She's a good friend of mine and we text everyday in a way where we just make sarcastic jokes to each other and talk about life and school but we rarely get personal. I never know what to say unless I see a chance to make fun of her or she started the conversation. Anyone have any ideas?
