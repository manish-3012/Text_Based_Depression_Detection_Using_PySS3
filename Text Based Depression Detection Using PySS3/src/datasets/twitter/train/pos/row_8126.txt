Found empty Xanax wrappers in little sisters [F16] bathroom. Do I tell our parents? I was looking for something in our shared bathroom and came across a little metal tin, when I shook it I heard rattling. When i opened the tin I found 4-5 empty 0.5g Xanax pill wrappers. She does not have a prescription, and no one else in my family does. She is currently away at boarding school and will not return until June. 

I donâ€™t understand why she is so problematic, she has even had a run in with the law once before. We come from a very good family with incredible loving parents, she goes to an amazing (and extremely expensive) private boarding school (which she loves) and none of my siblings have had issues the way she has. I am getting so fed up with her, I found other things in her room before but not said anything because I donâ€™t want to rat on her. 

But- we live in a country where drug abuse is punishable by death and she has already had brushes with the law before here (which is a huge deal in this country). I donâ€™t want to upset my parents or worry them, they are already dealing with their own issues. But I am scared she doesnâ€™t understand how addictive and damaging Xanax is, nor the consequences she will run into if she is caught illegally purchasing prescription pills in this country (my father could even loose his job and residency status as a result if she is caught). But also maybe I am overreacting? She is a teenager, and we all make mistakes and are stupid at that age. Iâ€™m just scared that because she has lived such a privileged, consequence-free life she willingly  continues to make terrible life choices and mess around with things that could ruin her. What should I do??
