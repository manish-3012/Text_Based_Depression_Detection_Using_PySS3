Can't go on Discord anymore So my grades are \*bad\* and recently my parents found out I have Discord, first time they blocked the browser, so I downloaded the app, then they found out I had that and deleted it. I redownloaded it and then they found out again, so now it's blocked and there's no way to go back now. I am grateful that, to my knowledge, my dad hasn't read any of my messages. The third time they saw I had discord I begged him not to block it because they were my only friends. I always tried to take care of them because some of them weren't in good places mentally, but now I can't check up on them, or talk to them. I can't tell if I have the right to be upset, because afterall, my grades are terrible, but then again they were the ones that were there for me while my parents didn't seem to care much, but they don't know that, and they don't know they helped me with one of my school projects. So is it rational to be upset-?
