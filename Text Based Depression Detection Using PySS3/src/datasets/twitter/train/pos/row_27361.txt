Kids in my school laughed at me for wearing a mask Why. The only question coming to my mind. Some of the thots complained the masks were claustrophobic and the chavs laughed at me and my friends for wearing them. I prepared for this and expected it fully but at the same time it's hard to prevent my braincells from eroding at an exponential rate.
