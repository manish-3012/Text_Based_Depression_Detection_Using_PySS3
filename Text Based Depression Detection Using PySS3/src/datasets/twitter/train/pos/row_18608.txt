Heard yâ€™all like otters The [marine otter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_otter) actually is a species of weasel! Itâ€™s scientific name also means otter cat ðŸ¦¦ ðŸˆ 

My personal favorite is the [hairy nosed otter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy-nosed_otter) , which is a southeast Asian otter species!

Please remember that many species of otter are considered endangered or threatened! Be kind to nature (and otters)
