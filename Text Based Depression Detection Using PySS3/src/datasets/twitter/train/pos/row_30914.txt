What is the best way to get a girlfriend as a teen? (15m) I really want a gf but all the moves and stuff I do ends up in girls saying â€œAw youâ€™re too nice, letâ€™s just be friendsâ€ which is a funny way of saying â€œIâ€™m not attracted to you enough to be an a relationshipâ€. Iâ€™m not even that bad looking!!!
