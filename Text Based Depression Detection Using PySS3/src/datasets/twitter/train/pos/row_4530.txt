I donâ€™t want the life my parents want for me. Iâ€™m 16 and Iâ€™m at the point in my life where I decide what to do for a career. I thought I had already sorted it out, I wanted to go into law enforcement and go to college for criminal justice. When I talked to my parents they werenâ€™t very happy. They said it was stupid and wouldnâ€™t pay well, they said that they wanted me to go into engineering and become one so I could provide for my parents and future family. They have also said that they will only pay for my college if I do what they want so Iâ€™m stuck in that regard. They also donâ€™t want me to get a job so I canâ€™t even pay for college myself. Iâ€™m not sure what to do because the career I want requires at least a bachelors degree. Does anyone have advice on what I should do from here?
