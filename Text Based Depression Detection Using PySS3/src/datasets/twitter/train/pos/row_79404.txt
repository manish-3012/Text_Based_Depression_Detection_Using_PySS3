I am too tiered for this shit I am so tiered to the point where my eyes really starts to sting, It feels like I am going to pass out.

My job ainâ€™t worth it for me to suffer with sleepless nights, I donâ€™t get paid enough to care. This winter depression is the worst one I have ever had, so that makes me feel even worse.

I wanna finish this year and go somewhere else cause fuck this, I would rather suffer in a place where I at least earn enough money

Thank you for listening to my rant
