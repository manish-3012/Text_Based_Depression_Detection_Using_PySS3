I just had the best dental hygienist at my dentist appointment So idk about you people, but I go to the dentist every few months to get my teeth cleaned.

Anyways...

I am that type of person where I hate talking to strangers. I'm an anti social/introverted person. 

So this is how my dentist appointment went.

The dental hygienist said hi, I said hi back, she asked how I was, I said, good, asked how she was, she said she was fine. You know... it's that weird introduction that's kinda forced when you are at the doctors office and they ask how you are when they call your name and you walk towards them.

I sat in the dentist chair thing (no idea what its called) and the hygienist did no small talk with me. AMAZIIIIING. Who wants to talk with someone when you have all of this metal crap, and floss in your mouth? Not me.

And when she was using the metal pick to scrape the plaque off my teeth, she didnt even stab/cut my gums like other dental hygienists have done. My mouth didnt bleed at all. (Dental hygienists can be aggressive when scraping teeth)

The only time it bled was when she flossed my teeth. That's my fault because I dont feel like flossing.

My mouth wasnt even sore after the appointment. This girl was the best dental hygienist ever.

(The hygienist did talk to me a little, to say things like close your mouth or turn your head etc.)

If you read this post, thanks for reading. If not, oh well. 

Have a great day!
