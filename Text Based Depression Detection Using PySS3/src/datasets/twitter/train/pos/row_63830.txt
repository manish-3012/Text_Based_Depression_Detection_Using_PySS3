My father verbally abused me... So, just recently my Step father has been yelling at me an unusual amount. Especially for minor things like having a sock in front of my bedroom door. He calls me immature and lazy and threatens to leave the house if I even tear up in front of him. I'm seriously worried about what is to come, I did some research and what he has been doing to me is verbal abuse. He also way overworks me by making me work for 6 hours a day daily. When I bring the work up, he says that it is all to pay for my computer and bad attitude, although I paid for my pc and he already punishes me for bad behavior. I just can't wait until I van move out to college, I'm going into the army so I can move as far away as possible.
