I've got the feeling that I am going to be beat up soon So, yesterday, some people played hentai on my school computer. I was furious, and in my blind rage, I picked a fight with someone. Now, the problem is, that guy is from east of the black sea, and these people tend to gang up against someone. Reasoning rarely works, and I refuse to apologize.

What should I do? Should I try to fight them? I just don't want to die slowly in an alley from a knife in my stomach.
