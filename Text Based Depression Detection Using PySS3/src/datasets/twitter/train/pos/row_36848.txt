I've been thinking about my life in 2019 and early 2020, and man I'm glad that period is over. Lost my grandmother January of 2019, had depression for a few months after that, then I was diagnosed with Inattentive-type ADHD (ADD), quite late to be diagnosed but it did affect my self confidence a lot. Went on a cruise and almost drowned at a beach. Broke an iPhone XR, then broke a XS which I got fixed. Then I went through a train wreck of trying to find friends on Discord until I finally found some, then lost them, then I made my own server and it actually was really successful (500+ users), I then got really stressed for having having run that server so I gave it to a friend, and then later regretted that for months. Then 2020 came.... my parents helped me gain a lot of self confidence back during quarantine which really did help. It was around June when I felt ready to stand up again, so to speak. Meditating on all that now and wow is it an interesting memory. 

Yes, it's not as bad as a lot of what you guys go through, but it really was one of the worse parts of my life. Now I have friends, I'm no longer shy, my parents trust me a lot more, and I've just been happy, even with what's been going on in 2020.

Moral of all of this, don't give up. A lot of you might be going through a lot of awful and painful things, but know that even if right now is awful you'll get through it, and then you'll feel happy that you did. People care for you, and whatever you are facing, if it's big for if it's small, you will get through it. 

I'll be turning 14 in a few weeks, so I hope for one great year of my life.
