my friend colonized the bunkbed send help Aa Iâ€™m just having a sleepover and Iâ€™m supposed to be sleeping with her in a double bunkbed, which started uncomfortably already since she took like 75% of the space and I had to sleep on the fucking edge. Now I woke up at 6AM (currently have slept two hours in total yay) AND SHES SLEEPING FUCKING DIAGONALLY AND I LITERALLY CANT LAY IN ANY POSITION ANYMORE. All I can do now is either browse the next four hours dying inside or awkwardly laying trying to sleep with my legs vibin off the bed. I really gotta chug a lot of coffee today if I want to survive.
