I was almost expelled from school today for having a â€œ16 inch switchbladeâ€ in class I was in math class today minding my own business when my pencil tip broke, I had no sharpener and we arenâ€™t allowed to use the ones in school so I used my house key to break away some of the wood around the graphite. After my class, I got up and went to LA nbd right? Then, out of nowhere, three police officers and the dean are surrounding me and telling me to follow them. I have extreme social anxiety so this was scary as all fuck, but anyway, I am marched into the deanâ€™s office where I am told to take off my sweatshirt and empty my pockets while one of the officers does a bag search. The dean starts yelling at me and asking where the knife is and I was just standing there confused as all hell. I try to clear up everything with them eventually, explaining that I used a key and not a 16 inch switchblade but this only makes him more angry. He tells me that if I keep lying I will be expelled, but I stick to my story and get my friend to come in and relay my story as a witness. It turns out that this girl Melanie had thought it would be funny to lie about me having a massive switchblade for some fucktarded reason. She was suspended for 2 days, and that was it.

Iâ€™m just glad that they didnâ€™t find my underfolding AKM in the hidden compartment of my bag...
