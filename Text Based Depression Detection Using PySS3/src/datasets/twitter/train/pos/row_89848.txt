I have a presentation next week, and I am really really anxious for it... So I have a presentation on a project I created on data structures on the topic graphs and graph manipulation where I need to explain an entire piece of code that I created from scratch, explain the algorithm and working for the whole thing

I am really really introverted, suck at public speaking, stutter a lot while general talking, get stuck in between when talking to a bunch of people and it's a nightmare for me to talk to anyone in general, let alone a class of 60 students and 2 teachers judging my project...

the last time I ever gave a presentation was 4 years ago in school talking about a history project and I broke down when giving the presentation, and I don't want to do that again

I don't know what to do, and how to do it, I really need help with this presentation... the only thing going for me is that it isn't in person, but we still need to keep our face cams and mics on at all times which really sucks...

please help a fellow teen out
