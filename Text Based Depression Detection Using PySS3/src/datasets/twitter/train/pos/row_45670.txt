Lately I've been feeling useless. Lately, I've been feeling like nobody needs me. My boyfriend is part of this but it's also everyone else. I have some online friends but they all take so long to reply or don't ever seem interested in the conversation.

Back to how my boyfriend makes me feel. He's always defending his friends and never defends me and he expects me to like his friends but is extremely toxic to mine (and sometimes to me). I don't think he realizes how he makes me feel but all of my friends do and they tell me to break up with him. I don't get why they tell me that. I really love him and thinking of him walking out of my life makes me hurt so bad. Our first time breaking up, I was up crying until 7 am, harmed myself, and even thought of killing myself. I need him but the way he ignores me or defends his friends and never defends me makes me want to cry.

I've been feeling the need to cry for so many days but I can't get myself to cry, I feel empty and lonely. I want people to need me as I need them.

Thanks for anyone that "listened".
