I don't care if people disagree with me but The guy who keeps editing himself into memes/meme templates is a fucking legend. It's hard to get a variety of posts in this sub but this guy has it all. And can we also talk about how good his editing skills are? His isn't just throwing pictures of himself on random memes,

he's throwing pictures of himself on random memes with full power.
