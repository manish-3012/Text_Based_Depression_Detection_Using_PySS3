anyone know any teen drummer in london? I started a band, we have me (the female vocals and playing bass), a violinist, two guitarists and a keyboardist. we are looking for a drummer now and need help finding one. 

if you also can, it would be amazing to be recommended a place to find any drummer aged 15-21 based in london? thanks!
