I have never had ONE good friend in my entire fucking life I was bullied in middle school and nobody liked me, now I am at high school and nobody bullies me, but I have zero friends. I hate every single second being alone. Whats the point of doing anything if I cant share the stuff I do with anyone?

Worst part of having no friends is knowing all the fun stuff Im missing because I habe no friends.

I feel like everyome has found their group by now and I feel so alone. Fuck this.
