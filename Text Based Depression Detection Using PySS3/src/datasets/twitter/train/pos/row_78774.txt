I still think of her every night Is this sad? 

I haven't talked to her in 9 months, and even then we weren't really good friends or anything. I really liked her, and even after all this time of not being able to see or talk to her, I still think I do.

I have no way to contact her and I'll probably never see her again either. Yet I've been finding myself thinking about her every night, and I can't stop. I don't know what to do
