Lost the science fair, but touched So I recently lost the science fair which was like 30 people and 5 winners, and results just came up today. I was really bummed, but my family and friends are all so supportive and have tried to make me feel better. 

I'm so grateful to have them, especially my sister, cause we were all so hyped when I got the chance to participate and I worked on the presentation this whole mid-winter break. 

I asked my sister whether she was disappointed, and she said why would I be disappointed, and said that the only reason why I didn't win was because she wasn't specific with her prayers enough so I'll win next year. Really made me tear upðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, don't really feel disappointed for not winning anymore, but kinda feel lackluster for letting the people down who were cheering for me.
