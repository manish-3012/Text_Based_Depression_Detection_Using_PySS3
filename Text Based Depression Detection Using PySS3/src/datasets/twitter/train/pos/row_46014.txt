Hey guys I just felt like talking about some stuff Since this is a subreddit where we can casually have discussions, I recently came across some artists whose music I really loved and they give me a very relatable vibe. I just really wanted to talk about music for some reason tonight. This artist *Alec Benjamin* is amazing and he's stuck in my head for days now. If you plant to check him out, check out his *It must have been the wind* or try *1994* 

Great songs. 

Another artist I'm falling in love with is Finneas. His *let's fall in love for the night* is my top5 easily.

Ed Sheeran is my favourite singer, his + and x albums are my favourites, but one song I've always found underrated of his was *U.N.I* and it's definitely not a song you'd see coming if you know Sheeran for Perfect, or Shape of you only. Another Sheeran underrated gem is *New York* and I think *Nina* is another one of those underrated poppy songs that haven't been heard. 

*Afire love* and *One* are two songs that can touch your heartstrings, and are super highly recommended by me. 

And I live Vance Joy. *Riptide* and *Georgia* makes me feel like good songs can still exists today, and tbvh, these two songs are better than the 90s hit songs. 

Bonus song: Billie Jean by Michael Jackson. Oooo lala such a sexy song istg. 

Sorry if this post isn't appropriate for this sub, I don't wanna discuss everything in depth or anything. I just wrote these songs down because I wanted to talk about them and if anyone has heard and liked these songs, or is looking for songs and will hear these and talk to me casually about them, that's what would make me happy. I hope this post doesn't come across as super weird.
