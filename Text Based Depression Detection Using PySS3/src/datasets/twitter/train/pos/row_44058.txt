I realized that instead of evading my crush, talking to him instead could build a relationship (who knew?) I've always had the habit of lurking in the shadows when I have a crush on someone but I finally got the number of the guy I like and now we've talked for hours. Turns out he likes most of the stuff I do. Moral of the story: get over your nerves and put yourself out there. It's totally worth it. :)
