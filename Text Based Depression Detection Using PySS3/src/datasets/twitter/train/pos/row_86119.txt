A goodbye I just recently had my birthday, and that means I'm no longer a teen. Goodbye my fellow mutuals, it was great knowing you. A lot of your posts brought me joy when I was scrolling through reddit, but now I feel like I must go away, I've become the imposter after all.

Wishing everybody here a great time, have fun, live long, and enjoy your teenage years while they last.

~your fellow freshly 20 yo,
