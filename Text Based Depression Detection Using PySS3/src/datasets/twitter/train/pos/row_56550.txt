Open your kraft mac&amp;cheese from the bottom I didnâ€™t post this on r/lifeprotips because it didnâ€™t seem significant enough

but seriously itâ€™s like the boxes are printed upside down the contents are upside down and the box is easiest to open from the bottom I swear this will make making Mac and cheese so much easier 

like go and make yourself some (you earned it) and open it from the â€œbottomâ€ to see for yourself.
