GET YOUR SLEEP! Yesterday I went to bed at 8:30 PM.
9,5 hours of sleep.

I took a math test today and I totally killed it!
It may even be an A.

I did not think that I was gonna do so well. My previous grade was an E.

It's all because I was relaxed and had enough sleep. So go to bed early and take yourself a little more time in the mornings. You will not regret it.

End of story :)
