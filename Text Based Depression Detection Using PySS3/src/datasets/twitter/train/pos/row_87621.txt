My Spanish teacher is bullshit So basically today my Spanish teacher told a classmate of mine that he (Let's call him Daniel) forgot to turn in the homework. The homework was online and the due date was that day at midnight, so Daniel should have had the whole day to do it according to the teacher's own due date, but apparently she said "that's what we've been doing all year" as if that justifies moving up the due date for no apparent reason and counting work late despite it not being late.

It's not the first time she's pulled bullshit like this. She's just way too bullshitting to be a teacher. I hope she gets fired.
