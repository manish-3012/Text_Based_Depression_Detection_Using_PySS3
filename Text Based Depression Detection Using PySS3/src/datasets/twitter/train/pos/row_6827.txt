My crush stopped talking to me ...  I like this girl . We used to talk a lot before I mean we used to talk all night and we shared everything . But since a few weeks we stopped talking IDK what happened but we stopped. The thing is that last time we talked she told me that she has a boyfriend . I respect her , so.... I did not confess to her that I like her but I saw them fight last week and now I am not sure if she is dating or not I cannot just ask her because we have not been talking . And I just don't know what to do . She has given me clues that she likes me in the past but I am not so sure right now. So..Now I don't know if she likes me, If she is dating actually I don't know anything ... 

I don't know what I did WRONG

But it is what it is
