Wanting to draw but like, I know somebody is going to say â€œwell, do art for yourself!â€ But I simply canâ€™t process this thought. Like, I just canâ€™t, I donâ€™t deserve anything for myself, I donâ€™t deserve anything overly so if Iâ€™m going to post art online I know everyone is going to hate it because it looks bad and that everyoneâ€™s drawings are way better than mine so why even try at this point.
