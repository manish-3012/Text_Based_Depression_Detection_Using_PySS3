Letgo ad problems So I was selling my old setup to buy a new one before school starts. I put the ad on letgo because my friends and family recommended it to me. So a few hours after me posting the ad a girl responded saying...

Girl: â€œHey this still up for sale?â€
Me: â€œI live in Maryland so Iâ€™ll pay you an extra $75 if you deliver it to meâ€

I ended up taking the deal because more money and I wanted to go on a trip before summer ends. Then she sent me her address and it was a two hour drive. She then went on to say that sheâ€™ll be a bit short on cash and asked if â€œI wanted to have something along with the cash to subside some of the cost.â€

What should I do?
