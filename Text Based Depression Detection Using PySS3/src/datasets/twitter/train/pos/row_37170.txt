Idk if I'm in love Hi, I've found this sub about 5 minutes ago and scrolling the various topic, seems like is the right place to solve my doubts.

I start saying that English is not my first language, so I probably did some mistakes.

I don't understand if I'm in love with my best friend and if she is interested in me.
We know each other since primary school and this year we finished high school. For some reasons we end up going to the same university.
We get along very well, we have no problem sleeping in the same bed, stay close, passing entire afternoon together, etc... things that two best friends do.

The problems started this summer, me and her were bored because we were on holiday with our parents and we started chatting and calling at the phone almost every day. When we met I started creating occasion to be alone with her but my friends are stupid and didn't leave me alone. Finally, some days ago I helped her for the an exam but I came out from her house more confused than before.

During past years I had my experiences and I know how does it fell being in love but this time I'm not sure if it's the same feeling.
Another thing that confuses me are our (female) friends. They sometimes started saying why we two don't start dating and they look at me as I should understand something. (This is my thought, I'm not sure)
She is quite shy, especially with guys, so she probably wouldn't do the first move, but I'm afraid to do it beacuse I don't really know what I feel and I've always considered her more like a little sister (despite she is older than me).
 
Hope you guys can give me some good advices.
Thanks in advance.
