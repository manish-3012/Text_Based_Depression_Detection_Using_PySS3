Just wanna know if Iâ€™m not alone in this So anyone else think that relationships are over rated. Iâ€™ve been lead on, let down and heart broken in the past and I was done with feeling emotion and forming super close bonds with people. Iâ€™ve grown out of my shell a bit and I just wanna smash and go. Anyone with me???
