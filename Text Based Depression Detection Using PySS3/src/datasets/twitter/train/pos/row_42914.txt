Guys, remember how to talk and interact with disabled people btw please comment. this is for a project but i also believe that what iâ€™m saying is true. 

Iâ€™m saying this cause iâ€™m a bit awkward so I donâ€™t really know how to talk to disabled people. I asked a few communities on reddit. and they basically all said to treat them with respect like everyone else, but also they might like to be treated a bit differently. Pretty much only treat them differently if theyâ€™re specifically requesting 

This seems pretty basic, but I feel like I wouldâ€™ve been too nice or maybe they wouldâ€™ve thought I pitied them, so I just gotta remind you guys. I thought maybe this would help you guys too. What do you guys think?

btw please comment.
