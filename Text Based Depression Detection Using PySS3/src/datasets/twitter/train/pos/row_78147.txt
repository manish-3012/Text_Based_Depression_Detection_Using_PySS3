Did know where to put it. It's about time travel I'm writing a time travel story and basically at one point there's a bootstrap gun where one of the versions revives a gun from his future self and fires one bullet from it before time travelling again and becoming the future version, passing on the gun etc. Now my question is after a number of loops would the gun end up being empty because everytime the past version revives gun gun theres going to be one less bullet right?
