Wtf even is post nut depression Iâ€™m a guy and Iâ€™ve been beating my meat for years now. Itâ€™s become a part of my life thatâ€™s mandatory and now I donâ€™t even think before I do it. I either pull up porn or hentai and Iâ€™ll be done In a few minutes. But a while back when I joined this sub Iâ€™ve always seen posts discussing post nut depression and how it always hits hard. But Iâ€™ve never experienced this. Iâ€™m never left with this feeling that everyone seems to yâ€™all about. What is it, and why do some experience it?
