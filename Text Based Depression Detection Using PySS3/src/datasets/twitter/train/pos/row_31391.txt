Well my aunt got scammed and lost all of her money. My aunt is a single mother with one kid who is not old enough to know the world is evil. This morning, she received a call from "The bank" and gave them every information that they asked (very smart move huh?). The next moment she looked in her account, everything is gone. She doesn't even use cash. She heavily relies on debit and credit. We kinda need advice now.
