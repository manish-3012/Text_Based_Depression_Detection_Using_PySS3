I would be a good parent because I would accept them if they were gay or transgender, I would never hurt them out get mad for stupid reasons, etc. But I don't ever want to have kids. It seems like mostly only bad people want to have kids. Like my parents abused me my whole childhood and it just fucking hurts and sucks so bad.
