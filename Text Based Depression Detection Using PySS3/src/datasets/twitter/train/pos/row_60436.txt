Why Xbox is better than PlayStation( in my opinion ) Ok ok so I know Iâ€™m already gonna get a lot of hate for this but Xbox is better than PlayStation my first point is the price the new Xbox series x is 500$ and so is the ps5 but both consoles have a full digital version that most people are gonna be buying and in that case Xbox wins with their 300$ console compared to ps5 400$ console which the PlayStation digital version only beats the console in storage in that case but in the series x and ps5 case for storage where the series x has 1TB and the ps5 only has 825GB. And as of the games that is a complete preference but for me Xbox has the better titles. And game pass PlayStation may have their ps now or whatever itâ€™s called Xbox game pass wins 100% because of the fact that itâ€™s on pc Xbox and mobile plus it includes free member ships such as Spotify premium, discord nitro Funimation + and even Postmates for free deliveryâ€™s. And for the sound of the console the Xbox is way more silent than the ps4 we donâ€™t know much about how the Xbox series x and s and ps5 but Iâ€™m assuming that all of them will be much more silent than the previous generations. And one thing that PlayStation has Iâ€™ve Xbox is VR but to be honest PlayStation Vr is a ripoff now that oculus quest 2 is out for 50$ less. That is why I feel like Xbox is better than PlayStation if you have any counter arguments put them in the comment section
