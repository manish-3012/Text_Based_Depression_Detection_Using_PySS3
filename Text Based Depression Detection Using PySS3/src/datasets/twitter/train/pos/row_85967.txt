I canâ€™t sleep, not waiting to catch Santa Claus, just super paranoid :(( I have really extreme paranoia at night time and always think something terrible is gonna happen... well I canâ€™t rlly sleep without all my lights on anymore. Or sometimes not even in my room.

But tonight itâ€™s extra bad,, I canâ€™t even close my eyes without feeling intense fear... probably cuz I had an energy drink earlier even though they have rlly bad effects on me, I just wanna sleeepeppepepe man
