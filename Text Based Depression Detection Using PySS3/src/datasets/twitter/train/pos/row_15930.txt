Is it a problem to be myself? So I'm an Indian guy. Is it the best country in the world? Heck no. It's far from most of the countries in the world in a lot of things, but does it make me a criminal/alien? I don't think it should, but it's what happens in most global communities. Telling people that I'm Indian seems to raise a feeling of instant revulsion in people. 

To give you an example, I came across this guy from California in a Lo-Fi music stream. The whole time, he was screaming in the chat, how he was so lonely and had no friends and wanted someone to talk to him. I gave him my Discord ID and invited him to chat. I told him I was Indian and voila! "Oh" he says, "I'll be back in a minute", and I never heard from him in the last 5 months.
