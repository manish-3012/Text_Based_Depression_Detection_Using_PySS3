Should I go fully online?? I've been considering this, since my school is going fully back in late April, just with masks. So.. here are the pros:
No more annoying kids
Not as much a high risk of covid
No more teachers
No more masks during school time
NO MORE ENGLISH TEACHER YELLING AT ME!!!!!!!!
I get to choose my breaks
No waking up early
NO GYM
No more heavy backpack

And then... the cons...


Cons:
No more of the teacher I like
adhd.
More online meetings.
