I've thought for a bit So, negative attitude generates negative attitude, making everyone more sad and unhappy, but positivity makes people happier. So I wrote this.

No matter who you are, no matter where you're from, someone always cares about you. Whether it be a close relative, or a far away friend, know that always, someone cares deeply about you. If life isn't going the right way for you, focus on the good points on what is going on. Even if times are really bad, if you try to be more positive, you'll be a bit more happy.

I hope this improved your mood, even if only by a bit, at least you're happier than before! :)
