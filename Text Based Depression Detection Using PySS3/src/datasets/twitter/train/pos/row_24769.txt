not my brother having a PARTY during Covid while numbers are rising This boy I swear. Heâ€™s 21 and all his friends are home from college. Itâ€™s almost 10pm and he invited people over! Admittedly, thereâ€™s only 5-6 of them so heâ€™s still in guidelines... 
But! Theyâ€™re drinking alcohol and playing pool and playing music on the back deck and itâ€™s very loud. 
I have gatherings with my friends but we are pretty good at social distancing and mask wearing when necessary. We are also all in our own friend â€œbubble.â€ HIS friends all came back from college in their dorms and houses with many other people.
Granted, our family already had the virus back in March. But still! Ahhh I want sleep!
