It is 10:49, on Sunday, January 3rd. This is my first post here on this subreddit. This might not seem very interesting to some of you, but I hope you can spare a few moments of your time to read this. 

I've had a vision of a perfect world, which we probably all have, but my vision might be different. I always loved music and spreading a positive message through words. Although my parents never agreed on a message through music. Hell, they don't even listen to my words. I've talked to them about my thoughts, in which they respond with "just be happy." I have lied to mother when she asked if I ever wanted to take my life. I have always thought of going into the music industry but never knew what I wanted to sing about. That's when it hit me. What if I talked about problems that people could relate to? I want to try to make people feel like they have a chance to come together through their problems so they know they're not alone. 

Now I have more to this "vision" of mine, but if it's hard to write it down on a piece of paper, it's hard to describe it through text. I know this post is just thrown around and may be difficult to understand but, it's difficult to talk about when not in person.

I hope this reaches everyone well.
