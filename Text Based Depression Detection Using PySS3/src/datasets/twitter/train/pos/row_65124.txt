I need some help So my step sister (whose in the same grade and class as me) posted a very embarrassing thing on our class gc about some guy and I. Iâ€™m a very shy person it took my a long time to break out of my shell and now all that progress is ruined and I never want to open up to anyone ever again. After she posted the video I left the gc and asked her why she would do that and she kept saying â€œoh it was a jokeâ€ or â€œeveryoneâ€™s taking it as a joke!â€ But should I think itâ€™s a joke if everyone else is? Sheâ€™s posted that without my knowing and my permission and after that all I did was ask her to respect that I want her to ask me but she laughed in my face. My stepdad confronted her and she said she was trying to understand what I was feeling but if she did she would have apologized and respected my boundaries, but she hasnâ€™t. Now my little sister and her are acting like itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m mad at her and that Iâ€™m in the wrong and honestly theyâ€™ve convinced me that I am. Even though itâ€™s only been three days the two nights after what happened Iâ€™ve been crying myself to sleep because of it, asking myself â€œwhy do I have to ruin everything?â€ Theyâ€™re (my step and bio sister) are talking about me behind my back. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with social anxiety and Iâ€™ve told them about it and how Iâ€™m very sensitive about people talking about me behind my back but they donâ€™t care, they donâ€™t care that theyâ€™re making me live my worse nightmare. I donâ€™t want to go to school. I loved it at school because they had such a nice environment and I had friends there and now I donâ€™t even want to step foot in there. The bad thing is is that she knows a lot of things about me that I wouldnâ€™t tell anyone there because I had trusted her and opened up to her so Iâ€™m afraid that sheâ€™ll reveal those things too. Itâ€™s really hard for me to trust people because of events earlier in my life. The thing is I was definitely not in the right place before I met my step family but now I feel the exact same way, friendless and alone.
