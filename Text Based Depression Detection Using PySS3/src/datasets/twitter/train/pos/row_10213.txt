Short tennis rant incoming Iâ€™m on the hs tennis team for some reason and weâ€™re playing tournaments every week. At the first one I played doubles which I think Iâ€™m ok at but is not really my forte. At the second and third one I played singles because the coaches said my serve was the one thing holding me back from playing doubles, which I completely agree and am ok with. Now I have to play mixed doubles, which is boy and girl, because the other mixed doubles guy had a â€œbadâ€ attitude . Iâ€™ve never played mixed doubles wtf do I do. Not only do I have to play doubles, which I think Iâ€™m bad at, but I have to play with girl. GIRL. I barely talk to girl and girls in general so how communicate. I havenâ€™t played a mixed doubles match yet because the last tournament got canceled and Iâ€™m really really really hoping the next one does to.
