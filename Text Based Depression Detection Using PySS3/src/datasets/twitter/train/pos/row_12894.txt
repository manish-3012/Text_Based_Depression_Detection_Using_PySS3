So... I have a question for you musically talented peeps out there... So, hypothetically, if I were to have written 30+ songs, hypothetically, of course, and I hypothetically had no idea how to play any instrument, and hypothetically had no instruments I could hypothetically learn to play, how could I hypothetically start a small band?

Hypothetically of course.
