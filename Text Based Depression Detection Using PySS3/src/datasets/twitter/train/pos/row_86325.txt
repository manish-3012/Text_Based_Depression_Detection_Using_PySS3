I hate society in general I hate how flawed and incessant it is. I hate how each gender is forced to measure up to a certain standard. I hate how these standards are forced on people with absolutely no regard for their feelings.

I hate how girls are supposed to be pure and kindhearted, how they're supposed to be weak and submissive. I hate how they're always told what to do and what not to do instead of accepting them for who they are.

I hate how boys are told to be strong, how they're told to "man up" and not cry. I hate how they're pressured to treat women like objects, and called sissies and wimps when they don't do so.

Society sucks, guys. What can we do? No one will listen to teenagers or take them seriously. The best thing we *can* do is not follow this tradition when we become adults.
