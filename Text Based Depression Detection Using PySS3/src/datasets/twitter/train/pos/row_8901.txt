Hong Kong COVID procedures are actually insane, it's like a communist regime's wet-dream So I just got back from a 3-week vacation in Sweden that actually ended up taking 9 months, and holy flipping jeez are the procedures here insane. We had to fill out a form declaring our health information before we were even allowed to leave the plane, it took over 3 hours of waiting in lines, triage stations, and... security again for some reason. Oh yeah, and they also make you put on a tracking bracelet.

So after all that, you have to spit in a vial and await them to test it for COVID, which takes 12 hours. Yep, they seat you at a plastic chair and desk for 12 hours immediately after getting off a 10-hour flight, making you wear a mask the whole time, even while eating.

Finally, after 12 frickin hours, you're allowed to go home, where you then open this app that they make you download and you have to scan your house to make sure you don't attempt to leave during the enforced 14-day quarantine. The app will also randomly make your phone buzz, in which case, it starts a 30-second countdown to make you scan your bracelet. You could be in the middle of a shower or dead-asleep, and it'll still start buzzing, does it 5 or 6 times a day. Yesterday, my Dad didn't get to it in time and frickin cops showed up at our door to confirm our location. You can imagine the kind of anxiety it gives you, just literally all the time.

Oh yeah, we also have to send in more of our spit 10 days in for testing, because all of that still isn't enough.

This is also after flying in from a low-risk country, I can't imagine what the folks who flew in from the UK, US, or any of the high-risk countries have to go through. I also don't even want to get into the kind of privacy issues that come with the government forcing you to download an app to your phone and forcing you to give it access to your files, which is a thing that they check.
