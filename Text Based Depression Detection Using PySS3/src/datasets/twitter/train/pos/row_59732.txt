Hey, I know this sounds like Iâ€™m an alien, but Is it normal for my mother to insult me like: parasite, worthless etc? for the record im male, in the middle of puberty and i am a black hole of food (quite literally) so if anyone can give me some feedback as to if this is normal or not i would be happy to read it.
