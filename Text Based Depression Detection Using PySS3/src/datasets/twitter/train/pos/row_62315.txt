Thank you I really hope that I don't sound narcissistic when I say this, but these past few days I have been feeling really down on my self and when I started considering suicide again I saw a bunch of post telling me I am worth it and that it gets better. I don't know who decided to start posting stuff like that but you might've saved a life so thank you!
