Todays my birthday, and it's literally one of my favorites so far! I worked for my parents all quarantine/summer, and built myself an amazing PC, and my parents are remodeling my room since I'm doing online school this year, and they got my an otamatone. Even though I can't hang out with my friends, or go out still, this birthday was fucking amazing.
