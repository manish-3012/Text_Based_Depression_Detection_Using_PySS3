Been at the psych ward for 3 weeks and tmrw I go back to school and pretend nothing happened :â€™) kinda scared ngl anyone got any advice? Going back to school for first time in 3 weeks tmrw and just f e a r idk how to interact with real ppl anymore like actual ppl. Like in the psych ward everyone truly understood each other there was no stigma about self harm or suicide and u could talk about it freely and no one would mind. There you didnâ€™t have to pretend you were ok. 

So tmrw i gotta go to school put on a smile and pretend Iâ€™ve been sick with a bad cold or smth and not in a psych ward for attempting sewerslide and just yeah. I gotta ton of work to make up and idk what the teachers are gonna think and my grades are gonna be so shit and yeah lowkey still wanna die but I gotta pretend I donâ€™t. 

To anyone whose been thru this before got any advice for me?
