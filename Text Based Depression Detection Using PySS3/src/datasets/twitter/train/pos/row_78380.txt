Tell me obe reason not to end it all. I have been feeling like ahit the past few years. Everyone says I'm just faking depression and I'm not really depressed. "Gen Z is all fake depression therefore you also do!". I am ao close ending it all. Tell me a good reason not killing myself. I don't care about the feelings of my family.
