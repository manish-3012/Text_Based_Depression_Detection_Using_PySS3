Western Women need to be Tamed Western women nowdays are very wild. They have no control over themselves and constantly look for fun. They cannot take distress and constanly seek acceptance from everyone else. This is why they need to be disciplined. They need to go through hardships to appreciate the simple joys in life. They make up situations in their mind and feel threaten by them. They live in their own created world which they are constanly in fear and in distress. This is why they demand for "safe spaces" in society even though society does not consist of predators trying to hunt for them. When a human feels threatened, they act in a certain way, in this case through pasive aggression. On top of that, the media feeds them with all kind of thoughts making western women believe that they are constanly in danger. Western men on the other hand are hopeless since they can't control their women anymore. They can't make their women feel protected and have become more of the female than the male. Nowdays in the western millennial world, the female dominates, and male follows.
