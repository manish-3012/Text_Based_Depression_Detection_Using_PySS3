Ngl my grandma roasted me today My grandma recently got a surgery for her kneeâ€™s so sheâ€™s not supposed to be walking around and actually should not be able to walk around. So today I was sitting upstairs watching some tv and my grandma casually climbs up the stairs and tells me to go get my snacks from downstairs. So I was kinda surprised asked her how she got here. And she said by climbing up the stairs, how else do you think someone else get upstair. So I said nothing and left to get my snacks.
