Okay, i have been writing rules to the universe. Yeah, thats right. I have been taking lessons from daily events and been writing rules to the universe. It is still not done, considering i probably still have some more time to live, but i have some that can be useful. So here they are:

Rule 1: Trying to be cool is trying too hard and is not cool.

Rule 2: Biting into ice cream is a bad idea.

Rule 3: Trying to gulp down an entire can of soda in one go is also a bad idea.

Rule 4: Deepthroating your microphone in a Discord voice chat is not funny.

Rule 5: Acting like you are depressed will lead to nothing but people calling you a faker.

Rule 6: Doing different and/or weird stuff just to get attention is the best way to get pitied.

Rule 7: Do not ask questions you do not want to know the answers to.

Rule 8: Stop dreaming too big if you do not want to feel like an underachiever.

Rule 9: Never quit a line because the other one is shorter. When you switch lines, the prior will start to go faster.

Rule 10: Roasting people to try and be popular makes you unlikable.

Rule 11: Wear gloves when handling smelly cheese.

Rule 12: Avoid all girls named Jessica.

Rule 13: Also avoid all boys named Jessica.

Rule 14: The world does not need feminism, it needs gender equality.

Rule 15: Do not drink weird stuff on dares, it will make your stomach hurt.

Rule 16: Everyone has something to hide.
