ok, so legit hear me out about this, what if all political ideologies are incorrect you often hear people talking about which political ideology â€œworks bestâ€ but like, is there any reason to believe that any political system even works in the first place? like, give me an example of just once, a state implementing a system that:

1. is sustainable

2. is stable

3. does not rely on human suffering

4. does not exploit other countries
