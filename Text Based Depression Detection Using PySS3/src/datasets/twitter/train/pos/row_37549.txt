Jesus christ bro This guy has been repeatedly DM ing me trying to tell me that 'Americans have no accent and it is the normal way that humans speak'. Americans you have an accent, an AMERICAN accent. He was trying to also make the point that before the American war of independence  everyone in the British Isles spoke like Americans, and that every single person after the revolutionary was decided to 'cHaNgE tHeIr aCcEnt'. He was repeatedly linking me videos of recreations of what people  sounded like in Elizabethan times saying 'sEe tHeY sOuNd jUsT lIkE aMeRicAnS' well he has obviously never been to England because they sounded like a mix between northern English and Scottish.
