Guys....she moved. Apparently her parents "didn't like her friends here" and I have to say I think I may be a part of that. On the outside I look okay, maybe a bit tired, but on the inside I'm crying my eyes out. The first person I tried to rely on for a hug or something, and I accidentally remove her from my entire life permanently. :'(
