No I didnâ€™t lose my virginity, or make a cool LEGO car. But my state just got hit by a hurricane. Hurricane Laura hit my state of Louisiana Wednesday night-early Thursday morning. Until this morning my town was out of power, but we have it back. My house still has not cooled off yet. Internet got turned back on a few hours ago. 

It isnâ€™t the same for the parishes (counties) below me. Vermillion, Cameron, and Calcasieu parish to name a few are destroyed. It was an â€œunsurvivable storm surgeâ€ as they called it. Some people that are returning home, have no home to return to. 

It may be months before power can be restored along the gulf in my state. Power poles and lines are destroyed. Entire trees older than my parents have been uprooted. At least 10 people have died in Louisiana, and 4 in Texas, with a total of about 14, with dozens still missing.

This is my home. I grew up in Louisiana, and now it feels like my state is gone. Iâ€™m hardly impacted, but family and family friends are. Some people have lost everything. Their lives have been destroyed, or lost. Holly Beach, where my family used to go when I was younger, is gone. Itâ€™s all gone, and it will never be the same again. I mean, everything will be fixed, power will be back on, houses rebuilt. But itâ€™ll never be the same. 

I know no one will read this, but I needed to vent. I feel stressed and guilty.
