A cool thing about Reddit So when Iâ€™m in Reddit after a king hard ass day if working at school then crying about something and coming here when you feel lonely and help less and seeing the funny jokes and wholesome stuff here itâ€™s just amazing they should make a cute for depressed days with Reddit cause Iâ€™m being honest I went from crying to a smile which is rare so thank you redditors for helping me and others
