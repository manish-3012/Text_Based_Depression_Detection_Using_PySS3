So my aunt just made a reddit account. ya so I was showing my aunt some funny reddit post and she decided she wanted to make a reddit account so she could browse memes and stuff on here. once she set up her account I helped her find some communities to subscribe to based on interest like r/facepalm , r/dankmemes , r/insanepeoplefacebook , etc and she found some on her own too like r/Sims3 . her account is called u/SFish2294 she probably wont post anything but still. now anyway u can continue on with ur day.
