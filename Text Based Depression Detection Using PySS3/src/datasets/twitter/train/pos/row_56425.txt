I think it's better to have gender-segregated schools. Call me old-fashioned but I just think its much better. They won't have the distraction of each other and they won't need to focus on how to get girlfriends/boyfriends in stead of calculus 101. It works best in London where the All-Boys and All-Girls schools do the best. The Girls and Boys come together for the prom and the disco so its not like they don' know the other gender. I wont say who was doing better tho
