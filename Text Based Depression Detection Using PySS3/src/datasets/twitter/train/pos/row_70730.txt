This one time something happened One time when I was brushing my teeth, I had to piss really bad, but I didn't want to take my tooth brush out, so I went to the toilet and took a piss. The entire time I was thinking, I hope the toothbrush doesn't fall into the toilet, and I clenched my teeth really hard. Half a second later, my toothbrush fell out of my mouth and into the toilet. Keep I'm mind, this was mid-piss, so the toilet was already yellow. For a few seconds I just stood there. Half in shock, half laughing. I didnt want to take the toothbrush out of the piss water, so I just stood there. I'm not sure how I got it out, but now I have toothbrush ptsd and fear using the bathroom while brushing my teeth or anything like that.

Not sure if anyone can relate

Don't brush while peeing kids
