I don't understand Heaven. In most religions, you die, you go to heaven.

And most people think that, if you die as a baby, you still go to heaven because baby's didn't have the chance to believe in a god.

So... If you actually loved your kid, you would kill them so they would go to heaven. Because if they grow up they might not believe in god, and go to hell.
