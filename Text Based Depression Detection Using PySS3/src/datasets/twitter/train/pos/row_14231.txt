i hate it when people act like they know more about your country than you do my boyfriend was telling me about his sisters friend whoâ€™s polish and about how their kids have polish names. one of those are zofia, and i showed it to mum and she pronounced it correctly and everything 

i told him i knew what it sounded like but he kept on going on about how youâ€™re supposed to say it... yet my mum is full blooded polish like ðŸ˜€ literally just shut up 

teens who are from different countries, do you hate it when this happens?
