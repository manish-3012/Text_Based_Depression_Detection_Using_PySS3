I came here years ago in the hope of finding others like me to have conversations with and this is all the posts are about instead. Someoneâ€™s too shy to ask out their crush

Someoneâ€™s pet died

Someoneâ€™s fake dying  

Or the newest trend:
 
50 people coming out for internet points all at once or saying something like â€œracism badâ€.

I miss the golden days of this sub when I was first a teen and all the crazy things people would post here,now I only find the occasional really funny meme from to time.

Anyone else fell like this?
