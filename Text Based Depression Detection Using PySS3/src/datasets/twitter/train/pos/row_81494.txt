So... im moving soon. How do i tell my friends? Hey. So long story short my mom is moving us to florida sometime before the summer. I have a chance to go early next month but if i go im not coming back. The only thing stopping me is my friends and see thats the problem.

I have about 4 close friends most of them ive known since grade school, 8th grade, etc. im really close to them and see them as brothers. Its been hard to see them tho thanks to covid. Like i havent seen any of them deadass in a year. My mom doesnt let me out the house at all, and all they go to is the mall and shit. They always bug me to go with them but seeing as how my mom is hard on me not going i dont really have a choice. And thanks to the fact im leaving literally next month, unless i decide to sneak out which is hard too, i probably wont see them for awhile. I mean its not that bad because my closest friend was planning on moving to Florida anyway and we were gonna live together for a bit and shit plus i can always just visit the guys (i turn 18 in literally 8 months lol) but its still hard and idk what to say and when to say it.

I already told my cousins and they did not take it well at all. I think one of them hung up and started crying... should i just say fuck it and tell them?
