I had nightmare about my cousin I did a post about him earlier, but this experience can be part of my personal history book... 

Well I had a nightmare where my cousin left me in the wood with a groups attractive but annoying guys with the intention that I marry one of them. This refers to the fact that everytime there's a man in my life he wants to know everything (it's hella annoying), for example he takes my phone out my hands starts reading our conversations and judging it. He has a lot of rules: no men of colour, no men with more power than he has, etc.

So back to the story I chose the pale shy guy as my future husband and we started kissing. The next day in my was my cousin not happy with the guy I chose out, because he was too nice and let me control him according to him so he chose my future husband (a tall guy dominant guy) and I had to meet him at a train station where I had to make out with him in front of my cousin and all his other friends. 

I woke up after that, realizing that it was father's day and that I had to visit my grandpa knowing that all my cousins, aunts and my uncle were there...

I'm worried about my future and my current love life as long as I'm part of this family any tips?
