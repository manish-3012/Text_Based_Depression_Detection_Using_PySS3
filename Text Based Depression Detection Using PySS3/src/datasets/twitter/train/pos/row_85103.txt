I need some advice pals So I have this girlfriend (woo crazy, I know) and things have been going better than ever, or so I thought. Last night, after she spent the day with her friends she hit me with the â€œwe need to talk about somethingâ€. Basically, she thinks we hang out too much, yet in the same text she said she loves to hang out. She says she has too much going on and is overwhelmed when literally all she has is online school and nothing else. Am I overreacting, or am I right to be upset about this? She claims that Iâ€™m doing nothing wrong and she still loves me but donâ€™t typical relationships mean hanging out frequently? Iâ€™m going off to college after next semester and I want to spend as much time with her as I can before our relationship probably ends, at least for a while. Sorry for dumping this on you guys, I just needed a place to vent
