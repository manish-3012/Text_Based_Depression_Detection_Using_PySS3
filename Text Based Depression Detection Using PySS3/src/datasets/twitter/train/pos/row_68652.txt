I might have a reason to pursue someone a second time, but Idk if I wanna do it I did say in 2021 I wouldn't miss any shots I make and now I might have to do it with someone I probably could've pursued back in Summer 2019 if I didn't completely fumble it by never messaging her

People think I should go for it
