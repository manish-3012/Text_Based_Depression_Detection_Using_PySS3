So I was about to search something on reddit when I found out that There was an earthquake on my state like bruh I didnâ€™t even realize, we also had tornadoes and hurricanes this week and again I didnâ€™t notice, we have mountains on the west and coast on the east and I live in the middle so it feels like the coast gets natural disasters and so does the mountains but in the middle we donâ€™t get anything but bipolar weather, I live in the most random state, North Carolina
