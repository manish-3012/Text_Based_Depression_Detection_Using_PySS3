Depression issues I know Iâ€™m only 14 but I rlly need help. I feel like everything rn is pointless and thereâ€™s no point in trying. My parents argue more wnd more about me. My dad acts like I ruined his life A lot. Tbh if it wasnâ€™t for my mom Iâ€™m not sure if I would be dead or almost dead. Anyone know if thereâ€™s anything to do
