is the american educated system really as bad as everyone says it is i always see educational stuff on tiktok and it surprises me how many people donâ€™t have a clue about info i feel like everyone should already know. saw a tiktok explaining mortgage the other day and the comments said they didnâ€™t know anything about it, thatâ€™s so crazy. also saw an entire comment section fighting over the definitions of socialism, communism and capitalism bc apparently nobody knows what those are either

people always say â€œi live in americaâ€ and itâ€™s like an excuse because our education system is supposed to be bad but tbh i feel like people just choose to ignore what theyâ€™re taught or donâ€™t take advantage of the extra resources given to them. i guess i canâ€™t really speak cause i go to a private and donâ€™t really know the difference but whatâ€™s so bad?
