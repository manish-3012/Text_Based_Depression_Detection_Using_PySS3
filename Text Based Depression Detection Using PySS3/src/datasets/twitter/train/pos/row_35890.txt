Why do suicidal people do this?? Why when someone becomes suicidal, they start acting like incredibly nice to people until they make some random friends and when they become like really, REALLY, really close to them then they just end themselves so their friends will suffer after. Like can you just die in piece without making random strangers sad about your death? Or at least talk to them about it so they cure your suicidal thoughts? I donâ€™t understand...
