Hey buddies, y'all are vallid. You are valid and a wonderful being, no matter what you are. If you're trans, you're vallid. If you have disabilities, you're valled. You are valid no matter who you call friend or not. You are vallid even if you are in a "weird" community like weebs, furries or even bronies. Everyone is valid, no matter what they are, even insane people are valid. You are valid, matter what you are. God loves all of you, as you are his creation. Have a nice day and stay safe.
