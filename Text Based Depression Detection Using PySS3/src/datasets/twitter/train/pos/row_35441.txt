Things that i like on a girl This post was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j0xj3u/things_i_think_are_cute_for_some_reason/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I like girls who wear hoodies and jeans. (They look hella cute)

No earrings bracelets or necklaces. (Idk I'm kinda weird ig)

Green eyes &lt;3

Simple girls, girls who don't make a lot of problems and are fine with life.

Small boobs are beautiful too, it doesn't matter the size insecure ladies

Tall girls are cute too 1,80m is a beautiful height for a girl don't worry about size lol

And that's it :o
