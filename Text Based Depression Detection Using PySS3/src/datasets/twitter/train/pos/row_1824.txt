Reddit glitch? Just been scrolling on reddit with Spotify on, and Audio from videos on reddit start, without me being on that post, stopping the music. And then I scroll a bit , and come to the post where the audio is from. Anyone else got this?

(Also didn't know what subbreddit to post this on, if there is a better one, suggestions will be appreciated)
