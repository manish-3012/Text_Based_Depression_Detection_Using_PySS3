Some of y'all really need to stop sneaking into girl's dms... Like bro... Stop it. Just stop it ok? Do you really think she's gonna be your gf by sneaking into her dms and saying something like "hey ;)"? No, of course she won't. You're literally harassing her online without even knowing it. Some poor girl out there probably just wanted to post a pic of herself in this subreddit and some random thirsty dude sneaked into her dms and made her uncomfortable as hell. Look, I know you want a girlfriend (and there's nothing wrong with that) but this isn't the way to do it ok? Proper relationships take time and patience in order to be successful.
