Anyone else already hating this school year? It's only the third day of my senior year and I've cried each day, mutiple times haha. Idk, I'm already stressed for my classes, and I don't even have that many. I only have 3 APs, but my teachers have already warned about how difficult they are and I know that I won't be able to keep up. I have band, the one class I used to actually enjoy, but this year I absolutely loath it. I get frustrated having to practice, and they're making us perform our region music (super difficult) for the class EVERDAY. I was shaking so hard earlier after only playing 8m of my music. I got bumped to the top band this year, but I'm not able to keep up with it. They put me on a new instrument, but even so I should still be able to play better than this, yet I can't. I hate all of my classes smh. I'm also super stressed for college cause I have no idea what the hell I'm supposed to do for any of this. I have no one to talk to except for my sister, but I feel bad for always dumping my problems on her and she can only do so much to help. I'm extremely stressed right now, hating life and myself, and kinda want to die lol. I just want to sit in my bed all day and not do my school work. We're still on online school for another like, 2 1/2 weeks, so I can't imagine how much worse I'll feel with the addition of having to see and interact with people and deal with my teachers face-to-face. sigh. Anyone else feeling this way? I hope not, but idk, I'm wondering if this is just me overreacting or if other people feel this way too.

ig this is kind of a rant, so i've flaired it as such. sorry if no one cares, i'm just really tired and sad. i'll probably delete this post soon anyways.
