Ideas for making money from home as a teen We all are struggling to make money.  r/slavelabour and r/forhire aren't super teen friendly and I'm not sure what sort of jobs I can get online. Help a brother out with some ideas, please! I can't leave the house.


Ideas I've had so far: trying to get my parents to invest in cryptocurrencies (alt coins) with some money I have saved, making art and shipping it online, writing blogs, streaming, youtube, making websites for people, data entry, music writing, tutoring online, social media managing for other people, the list goes on. We need more! Please consider adding SERIOUS ideas so that we can all benefit. 

Edit: If this post got some real traction, it could help hundreds of teens! Please try to put forward serious ideas so that we can all live better lives while we are quarantined!
