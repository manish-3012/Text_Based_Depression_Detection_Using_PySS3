Hey, I have a question Do you think being told to shut up about your feelings and problems is an issue just for boys?

Like showing emotion is not manly enough, and that boys can't cry, etc. 

Cause this dude said that only boys are told this. True or not? 

(honestly I think it's not only boys issue, but I wanna know your opinions)
