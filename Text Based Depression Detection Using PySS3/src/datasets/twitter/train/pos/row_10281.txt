I accidentally smoke bombed my house After I was done bringing in wood I thought "my gloves are wet let's dry them off on the wood stove" I forgot about the rubber grips and the grips burned off and smoked up the house, the smell was horrid and it seemed like my nose was about to bleed and everyone else is like who put these gloves on the wood stove and I'm like (0-0) not me, I think everyone lost brain cells today, believe it or not this is the second time I've smoke bombed a house 

TL:DR I smoked my house up with rubber gloves
