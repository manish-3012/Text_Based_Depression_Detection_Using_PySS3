I'm done with this system As an optimist, I see everything as positive in life, even the harshest things I see myself out, even joking about it, but this I just can't ignore.

I'm pissed about school's teaching system, I want a change in this as many as you do. Precisely I'm talking about a change in learning. Choosing career path's knowledge, lessons in life instead knowing useless stuff you don't even notice or cared about in the first place. I know I can't do this all by myself, but as I see from my eyes some ttied to make a change and got denied, all that because some old men thinking "useless kids, they need it to learn the old way". I hope this message touches someone and stands up for this. I'll be writing to some of my teachers about this, writing my fellow students about something in change of the ways the education system works. This will be hard, some teachers and educators will quit jobs, it might collapse but I'm determined to do it, this has gone long enough. 

I'm sorry for venting this out on all of you, but some might agree, some might not. I respect your opinions and criticism.
