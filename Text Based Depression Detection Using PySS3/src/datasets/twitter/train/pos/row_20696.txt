I'm so fricking tired I'm so fricking tired lol my dads a truck driver and I had to go with him and when we stop I can never fall asleep and last night or this morning if we just drove through the night he is asleep now and I'm really tired but cant even close my eyes without feeling off.
Ugh any suggestions?
