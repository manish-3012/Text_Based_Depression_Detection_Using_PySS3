My friends Alright, I just kinda... wanna ramble about this for a second. You donâ€™t have to read this, I just need to talk about my school friends and such.

So, the reason why Iâ€™m rambling about them will be explained later, lemme just... talk about them for a bit.

I... really like my friends. There great, there funny, there crackheads like me and we do all kinda stupid shit together. Like that time we accidentally made half a wasp nest swarm into one of the trash bins, that was pretty fun. Me and one friend play fight a lot, which is fun but can hurt a bit since the sack of fat is heavy- not meant to sound offensive. 
And then we have my female friend, which I can argue with for infinity. Its always stupid arguments, but I... kinda enjoy it. Sheâ€™s also really funny, kind and helpful... Iâ€™m glad we got to meet, just like with the rest of my friends.
Then we have the shorty, the tournament organizer. You really canâ€™t stop him from doing something he wants, heh. Wish I had such determination... though, he often takes on to much at once and it stresses him out, for reasons heâ€™d probably appreciate if I kept secret.
Further, we have the ADHD crackhouse. Heâ€™s pretty funny, and an amazing artist. He has some problems here and there with school but... heâ€™ll get through them. Though, sometimes, he just has to shut up since he talks basically every damn minute. Heh... not like I truly mind it.
And then we have the fortnite kid that somehow got in, and as much as he says he hates us- he canâ€™t deny he likes us around. Though he does get annoyed at us, and sometimes fights with one of us- I do kinda like him around. Stay strong in quarantine, buddy...
Lastly, we have my good olâ€™ glasses buddy. Heâ€™s such a dork, and he canâ€™t shut up about any kind of game heâ€™s into right now. Heâ€™s funny, heâ€™s social and he laughs about everything. I remember when he first told me about his issues... he was so awkward, so shy and had no self-confidence. It makes me oh so happy to see how far he has gotten... and I hope we stay friends for a while longer

Thatâ€™s everyone Iâ€™ll rant about right now...

Now, why did I do this?
Cuz I know at least two of them are probably gonna read this. I want them to know how much I appreciate them, but Iâ€™m to shy to say it irl... I want to tell them all about how insecure I am- about all my suicidal thoughts, about all my problems and all my true fears. But... being the stupid I am, I canâ€™t get myself to say it irl. It just... scares me. Once they know who I really am, will they still accept me? Will they stick by me? Or will they abandon me...

I really care for them all, and I donâ€™t want to lose them.


Thatâ€™s all... thanks for reading, if you did
