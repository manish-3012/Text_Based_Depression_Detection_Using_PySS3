This was my idea... I started this channel Freshmen Year of High School to have a center of all of my projects from now until I hopefully become an Electrical Engineer. Welcome to Error Electronics!!! Here, I post reveals of my own creations along with tutorials for some of them and much more! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKB0zxIfiJq43nLkn4xikQ
