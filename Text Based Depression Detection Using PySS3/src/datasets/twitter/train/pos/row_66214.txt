Looking young sucks ass Alright so one week ago, I (M18) saw that a local restaurant that is literally less than a block away and noticed that they were hiring for cashiers. I was intending on eating here but I decided to apply myself into this cashier position. The lady who I assumed was the manager told me that they weren't hiring at the moment but let my sign my name and number down somewhere "just in case". She also asked my age in which I told her I was 18.

Well today I went in with my mom and older sister and she just noticed that they were "hiring" or so I thought with the quotation marks. Same lady, looks me dead in the eyes for a second and then hands my sister a application.

Now I'm not mad at my sister, I feel like shes gonna get this job, amazing, congrats. But this is fucking bullshit man. Just because I look like a 13 year old doesnt mean that I'm gonna perform like a 13 year old as well. It's hard as fuck to find a job when you look like a kid
