please stop putting soaps in ur coochieðŸ˜­ first of all lol
you donâ€™t necessarily need to even use soap at all to wash the kitty cat, just plain water does the trick ! and itâ€™s actually the most recommended 
BUT, if you are not someone that is comfortable with just washing with water, or you think you still smell without using soap then use a MILD soap with NO fragrance or very LITTLE. 

TOOO many little kids (and grown teens lol) are improperly caring for themselves. Vagisil, Douches blah blah are not necessary ! Showering once or twice a day and washing the cooter is fine. These chemically produced products are not good for your vag! Unless recommended by your doctor, do not use these products, just plain soap or water. Also, if you are properly washing/ keeping clean and still smell (with the exception of humid areas,athletes, exercise, physical exertion or production of sweat) then go to a doctor! Every vag has a smell but if itâ€™s something that is pungent and doesnâ€™t smell like normal go to the Doctor PLS! 

and DO NOT stick or put soap/ or chemicals / or unsafe objects into your vagina ! PLEASE NO ! 

how to wash:
â€¢with warm water (or mild soap), use cloth or hand to open the lips (labia) and wash the creases of your vag, as well as raising up your libs to expose the clit/hood and gently clean the area
â€¢rinse
â€¢dry

itâ€™s just that iâ€™ve seen and heard A LOT of people that donâ€™t actually know how to care for themselves and just some advice.
