Guys can call each other cute without being gay. For the past 3 years, a certain double standard has grown increasingly obvious to me. Girls are allowed by society to compliment each other, be super-close, hold hands, and even cuddle. However, if you compliment a guy friend as another guy, everyone will automatically assume you're gay. As I understand it, society has decided that "Cool" is for guys and "Cute" is for girls, which doesn't even hold water because girls call each other cool and nobody bats an eye. Call a guy cute however and he hates it. Why is the word "cute" sexualized? Are animals cute? Yes! Are people cute? Also yes! It doesn't make ANY sense for 1 one word to have 2 conflicting contexts! This to me is extremely unfair. I may be a straight guy, but I'm super affectionate towards my friends, and I *refuse* to apologize for loving my friends. It doesn't mean I'm into them if I call them cute, it just means they're cute, end of story! If you just wanna be seen as cool, then that's fine. 

If you think your friend is a precious adorable cinnamon roll that must be protected, then that's also valid. Gender and sexuality has no bearing over whether someone is cool or cute. If you wanna compliment them, all the power to you.

My point is: Be yourself, no matter what society says.
