Iâ€™m doing a social experiment in a discord server I created, and was wondering if anyone wanted to join (itâ€™s unofficial, Iâ€™m just a teenager messing around) You will not be told the reason behind the social experiment, all that will happen is there will be 15 people in the server at maximum, and every three days 1 person will be v0t3d out of the server. This will go on for 30 days, and the last 5 people standing will discover the reasoning behind the social experiment and why it was conducted.

You should chat and be active in the server too, a requirement is to be **active**

I only have **3** spots left to give out, DM me if you want to join
