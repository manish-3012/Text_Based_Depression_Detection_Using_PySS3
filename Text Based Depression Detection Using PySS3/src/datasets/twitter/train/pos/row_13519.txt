Iâ€™m bored. These are rhymes. Iâ€™m not a depressed guy, but Iâ€™ll be fine if I die.

Life is worthless and sucks, and thatâ€™s why I wish I gave zero fucks. I hate everything about myself, I spend most of the time doubting myself. Why Donâ€™t I kill my self here? I hate who looks back at me in the mirror. Insecurities hurting more than a knife, why would I want to live this life? So here now I say goodbye, I will go sit in a corner and hope to die.
