I feel like a bad person When I got my Driverâ€™s License about 6 months ago, I was asked if I wanted to become an organ donor. I said no and my mother yelled at me and forced me to tell the guy that I changed my mind and to sign me up to be a donor. Six months later, Iâ€™m still angry about it and I still resent me being an organ donor. I keep my license out of my sight in the deep recesses of my wallet and I drive as little as possible so I donâ€™t have to experience the nightmare of dying and having my body cut open and mutilated, never to be able heal itself ever again. I donate blood whenever I can to the point that Iâ€™ve developed a ferritin deficiency because I know I can save lives but in the end Iâ€™ll heal and be normal again. Am I a bad person for this? I feel justified in my decision but I want to hear what yâ€™all have to say.
