Need help from a smart person. I wanna buy black ops Cold War for the Xbox 1.  Itâ€™s 63.00 dollars with tax and I have 29.00 dollars on a debit card, 30.00 bucks on a gift card, and 4 dollars on another gift card. Xbox doesnâ€™t allow using two payment methods so the only way to use two is with Microsoft account money. But thereâ€™s certain amounts of money that you can put on a Microsoft account. Help
