WHY DOES IT HAVE TO HURT SO MUCH TO CATCH FEELINGS I swear to god I promised myself I wasn't gonna catch feelings, I told myself I'd do my best to preserve our friendship, that I'd get better mentally first. But now that I think she likes me my brain gets completely fried and I overthink literally everything and its killing me. Someone off me.
