~Redditors Research~ Hi Reddit! I'm in high school and I've decided to write my AP Lang research paper on the redditor stereotype. I was hoping I could get some help from my Reddit demographic on determining what this stereotype is and maybe even get some funny statements to include in a speech I have to give. Reddit do your thing!
