I feel like I messed up So Iâ€™ve talked about this girl on the sub before and Iâ€™m back. I finally asked her out on a date and guess what she said no, I kind expected that but it still hurt. I donâ€™t know how to describe how I feel I just feel super, hurt? 
She didnâ€™t do anything wrong I understand why but I still feel shitty
