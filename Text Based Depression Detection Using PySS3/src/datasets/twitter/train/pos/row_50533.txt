I am sad, angry, concerned, disgusted...and i know i shouldn't I was just trying to learn more about the holocaust, after seeing an Anne frank movie, and the comments were disturbing in most of the videos I watched.

Claiming it was fake because ballpoint pen weren't invented at that the time Anne frank was writing (((she used fountain pen, geez)). 

Adding fire emojis, nazi symbols, and even claiming they would do the same thing again with the Jews.

What I am getting at bros, don't be disrespectful and immature, we are a new generation, let's act like we care about each other.
