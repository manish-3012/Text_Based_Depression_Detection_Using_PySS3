What annoys you the most about this subreddit? For me it's gotta be all the people who act like they know everything while still being a teen. Like I may be a teen as well but I won't try to act like I know everything about politics without doing any research I'll actually do my research on shit before arguing with someone. Just today I had someone tell me that pedophilia is mental disorder so it's treatable. No it is not it is something someone is born with it is impossible to change these people it's a demented twisted and disgusting sexual orientation so like all sexual orientations it's something that is impossible to change about someone but still having a 13 year old tell me how wrong I am about pedophilia (a subject I've done a good chunk of research on) and that these people can be fixed when they can not.


Also I should probably add this to this post just to clarify something. When I say that pedophilia is a sexual orientation I by no means am saying that is the same thing as being gay nor should it be apart of the LGBT community. It's a sexual orientation but it's a dysfunctional sexual orientation and anyone with it should be put in prison if they act on it on even the slightest ways
