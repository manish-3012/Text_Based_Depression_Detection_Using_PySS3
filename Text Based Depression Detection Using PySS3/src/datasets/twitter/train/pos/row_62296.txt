I hate my dad and I am changing my surname when I turn 18 

For almost 6 years, I have been verbally abused by my dad. It's a consistent string of mean things thrown at me for just existing in our house. Tells me if I was better I'd have more friends, I don't result to anything, that I don't have a future and it makes me loathe him.

My mom has been trying to help but it never works. He continues to do this, and I get nervous around him because of his outbursts.

One time he threatened to hit me. Scared out of my 12 year old mind.

I am now 16, a month away from 17. Just a few days ago, I said I didn't want to go run at a track club and instead go to the gym because I figured I'd like to work on more cross fit. There were insults and yelling, and then my sister told me he said he'd kill me, and he came into the basement and as I tried to go upstairs he grabbed me and wouldn't let me go. I told him to stop, he didn't, and I slipped out. I grabbed my charger and my phone and I sprinted into the garage, got my shoes and ran away full speed. I went to my friend's house shaking and we walked around until 1 in the morning, throwing rocks and sitting at the back of the school yard. That night, as we were going back to sleep at his house, I decided I was going to change my last name.

I hate that I have to have the same surname. 

When I get older, people will call me exactly what they called him. I hate him with a burning passion. I've decided that I'm going to change my last name to Kujo when I hit 18, and legally I won't need an adult. I'm disassociating with him. I just can't anymore.
