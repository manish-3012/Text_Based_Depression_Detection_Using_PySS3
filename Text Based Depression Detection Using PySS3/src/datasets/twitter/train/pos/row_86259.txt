Iâ€™m actually genuinely happy in my relationship My boyfriend (17M) and I (16F) played borderlands2 yesterday and we both had a really good time just playing it and chilling out together. Usually we donâ€™t play games together cause I donâ€™t particularly like video games but surprisingly I actually enjoyed it. In a way I feel like we connected on a level that we donâ€™t usually connect on, it was refreshing
