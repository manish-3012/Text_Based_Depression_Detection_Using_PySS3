I learned something about girls So I was talking to my girlfriend bout some random thing and one of her friends was there (it was a basketball game) and her friend asked me if I knew who one of my friends liked and I did and I told her and then she decided she didnâ€™t like him. This confused me because boys when they hear something like this either press and flirt harder or give up and live in a pit of depression. So then my girlfriend explained that girls stop liking boys if the boy doesnâ€™t like them just straight up almost immediately like someone new. Confusing night, and things you probably didnâ€™t need to know.
