Holy shit I think she likes me back Never have I blushed this much before

Holy shit I think my crush has started to like me. She almost sat on me yesterday on the bus â€œaccidentallyâ€, though she made a smile that kinda said that she wanted to do it and just rub it off as an accident. She pretty thicc too. In the morning, her friend asked her why we where talking (we donâ€™t really talk to eachother very often), she said â€œ Well it turns out, heâ€™s actually a pretty cool dude.â€ Then she smiled at me. Weâ€™ve been talking a lot and flirting. Some little shit (6th grader) keeps trying to talk with her and show her shitty tik toks as a way to try and date her. When he leaves the bus tho, we talk shit about him and how annoying he is and we both laugh. Itâ€™s been pretty good.
