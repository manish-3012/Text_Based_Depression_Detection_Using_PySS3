Me and my brother asked my mom for uncensored Netflix... She refused because her friends told her "it's not Muslim" and we asked her why she is being so backwards... She just spent an hour calling us ungrateful and materialistic bastards. Smh. 

     Like porn is a sin, you wanna jack off!? No way! That's not Muslim, wanna watch a girl dancing?! That's not Muslim! Want equal rights for LGBT people!? No fucking way! God hates them but don't worry he'll love you for hating them.

      What the hell is wrong with religious people and there stupid beliefs, bitch I'm alive, I wanna have fun. I want shit, I wanna do shit. I was born to collect material, I'm gonna collect material.. Who tf is you to call me "materialistic"?
