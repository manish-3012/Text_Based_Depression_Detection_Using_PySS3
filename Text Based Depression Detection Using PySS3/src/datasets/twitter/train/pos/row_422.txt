First day of high school! Hooray, right? I'm in high school. I'm gonna get a better education. I'm gonna have so much fun. Pretty much all my old friends from middle school are in the same high school as me and most of them are in the same class as me. Hooray, right?

If only I wasn't such a fucking failure of a human being, huh. If only I knew how to keep a conversation going. If only I knew how to talk to new people. If only I could get enough sleep to actually listen in school. If only I didn't basically have panic attacks in the middle of the hallway because there are too many people around. If only I wasn't constantly anxious about having all the possible mental and physical illnesses in the book. If only I wasn't bi and trans. If only I had a relationship with my dad whom I live with. If only the one person who I feel like actually gives a shit about me in this world didn't live 700km away.

I fucking know that no-one cares and that everyone has their problems. I just want someone to listen to me. I'm just so done and so miserable. I have no friends. I have zero social skills. I'm constantly anxious. Why does life have to be like this?
