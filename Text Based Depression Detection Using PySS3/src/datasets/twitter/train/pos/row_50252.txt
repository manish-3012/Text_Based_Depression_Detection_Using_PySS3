any other 13/14 year olds learning japanese? i love the culture in japan and really want to learn! *insert hello in japanese here*

as you've probably guessed by the title, i'm a small teen trying to learn japanese, but i've got one problem:

IT'S HARD AS FUCK AND PEOPLE ARE SCARY ISTG

'oh, don't forget to do listening and speaking practise! use the internet to talk to other japanese speakers?'

well yes, wise old adult who learnt japanese who is superior to me in every way, it is important, but my God i don't know how to say hi respectfully yet and everytime i join a vc in the japanese-english language exchange discord server everybody's like twenty years older than me and scary as fuck no thanks.

i'm wondering if anyone else around my age is also done with hiragana and katakana and wanting to learn japanese? ive got a shit ton of resources (genki 1 and 2 2nd versions as well as the workbooks and audio , guide to japanese grammar, minna no nihongo too im pretty sure) but nobody to learn with, so it'd be fun to have little group sessions w/other people.

if you're up for it please lmk and ill DM you my discord tag (as long as you're not a pedo lmfao)!

have a great day and drink ur water &lt;33
