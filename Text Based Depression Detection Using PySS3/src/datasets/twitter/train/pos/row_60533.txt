I need to rant about a problem which hasn't bothered me till like right now. Help I've liked the same guy since 6th grade, I'm in 12th now. I've almost dated people but back away last minute because I literally cannot get this guy out of my head. I never considered him a friend, we talked in 6th grade a lot but that's it. I haven't talked to him since but he's never left my mind. In 8th grade there was this rumor that he hated me so I confronted him about it in front of the school and he got hella scared (even though he's like a foot taller) and was like "yea cuz u beat me up in 6th". I don't even remember that, but I might have cuz I was really violent and aggressive in middle school. I've seen him around every single day since that grade and it's so stupid cuz I literally don't know what I like about him, his personality or looks? So idk what wrong w me and how to get over it. I also started feeling worse lately and just regret everything. I wish I could just restart my life, I hate it, it isn't just about some stupid guy but just how much of a shit person I was until high school which broke so many friendships. I'm tired.
