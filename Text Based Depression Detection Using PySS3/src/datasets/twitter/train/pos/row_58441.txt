Guess whoâ€™s going to have to say awake for the reast of the day now? Itâ€™s yeah boi. My sleep schedule is fucked and I canâ€™t sleep because I feel like someone is watching me. Iâ€™m so much of a failure I canâ€™t even sleep right. I got to bed and my brain was like: â€œYeah, you know that built in feature your body is able to use direct after birth? Well, we canâ€™t do that. Maybe should try it again in 24 hours.â€
