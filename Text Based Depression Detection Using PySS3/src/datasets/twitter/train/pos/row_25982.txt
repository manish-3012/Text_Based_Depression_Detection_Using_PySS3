Just had one of my most painful moments Covid was shit on my dad and he spiraled quite a bit. Days of fighting lead him to have spent the last 2 weeks in the hospital. 

Iâ€™ve spent the last 14 days without seeing or talking to a man thatâ€™s been there my entire life. It was harder than expected to be honest. 

I was on a bike ride today when I found out he was going to be home for a few minutes. I biked 3 miles in 10 minutes to see him, something I was excited for and hoped he was too. 

When I got there, the first thing he said was complaining about the status of the shed we were building in the backyard. Something we stopped doing because he wasnâ€™t there. 

No hug, no hi, no I miss you. Just immediate complaining that I wasnâ€™t productive in his eyes. 

Not something I was expecting, as something that hurt a lot. 

Sadness and anger are what Iâ€™m feeling. What a fucking shitty day. Not to mention I didnâ€™t get my full bike ride ffs.
