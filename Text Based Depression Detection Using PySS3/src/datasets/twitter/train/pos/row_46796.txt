She wonâ€™t love me back Well boys, my dream gf is in the midst of getting a new bf. I feel awful and selfish, because I want her to be happy and the guy seems great, but I want her. I really love this girl, I honestly do. I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m supposed to find anyone. So itâ€™s gonna be sad and angry hours for the rest of the night. 


Oh and yeah, we talk a lot, like sheâ€™s probably my best girl-friend, so Iâ€™m not feeling this way over a stranger.
