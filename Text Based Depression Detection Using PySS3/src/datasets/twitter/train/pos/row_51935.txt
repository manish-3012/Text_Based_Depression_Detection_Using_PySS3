Someone wanna read my rant? So I'm in 10th grade now and just finished first week of in-person school. My school gave the option of in person or online, most of the "friends" i had took online, and I now only see 1 friend I had from the previous year and we barely get a chance to talk. My first class with him doesn't give time to talk anyway except for the bus ride to main campus (I'll explain if asked). My last 2 classes of the day (first is 3 hrs next two are 1 1/2 each) are Algebra and Gov/Econ. Algebra is filled with what I'd call "preppy girls" who are nice to look at but shit to talk too since *literally* all of them think people actually care enough about their lives to want to see 30 pics per hour of them sitting in class. Really shows how far the generation has come, right? Anyway I don't want to talk to any of them, except as a non-cool kid I have some desire (as much as I'd consciously disagree with it) to talk to them and make them like me. Gov/Econ is basically the same, but here are some people who I suspect are older, but essentially the same as Alg. My goal for this year was to get a gf because honestly that'd help me reassure my own value to myself, but I doubt this'll happen considering that every girl around me is an Instagram thot and there's a bunch of better guys than me. Like tons. Literally at least 150. Thanks for reading my rant. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
