I feel like someone is out there that needs to hear this tonight If you are feeling down right now and you think that you cant do anything because people keep puting you down listen to this, ITS. YOUR. LIFE. Everyone else is just living in it. If someone tells you that you are unable to do something you work for it and get it done just to say that they were wrong. If someone says "youl never make it" work hard and make it because in the end they are the one who won't make it, how could they make it putting people down like that. See, you own your life, nobody can tell you what you can or cant do, no one can tell you how to live, what to where, who to love, how to look. You just be you and In the end that is what will let you climb to any height.

 I hope this is what someone needed to hear tonight. Have a beutiful life and good night, 

                                                 sincerely - Austin (zippy251)
