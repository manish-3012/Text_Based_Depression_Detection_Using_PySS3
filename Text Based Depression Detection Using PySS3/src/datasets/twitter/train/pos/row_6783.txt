Ok I think I have a problem Itâ€™s been 4 years since I had a lowkey crush on my best friend. It just comes and go. I feel like I actually have feelings for her for a while, then I actually realize I donâ€™t, then again I think I just wanna bang her. I just really donâ€™t understand. And yesterday I saw her after a while. We just hanged out, we hadnâ€™t seen each other for a month or so. And I was really confused, I donâ€™t understand, I really donâ€™t, what I actually feel for her. And that sucks because if I had a clear mind on what I actually think and feel Iâ€™d just try to solve this problem by telling her or something, but I donâ€™t really understand whatâ€™s going on with my brain so I canâ€™t. Ughhhhh, I really donâ€™t know where to go from here. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m stuck forever with mixed feelings.
