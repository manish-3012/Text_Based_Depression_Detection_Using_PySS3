ugh i sound like such a simp butâ€¦ i need your help. i like my best friend, a lot. Iâ€™m a guy and sheâ€™s a girl and iâ€™ve known her for 9+ years. we used to go to the same school but now we donâ€™t bcz of hs. i wanna shoot my shot but thereâ€™s a 99% chance of me missing. every day i donâ€™t tell her it eats me up and hurts so much. i wanna tell her, but idk how to. i heard that girls like confidence, but iâ€™m not confident that she likes me back and ik that for a fact. i also donâ€™t wanna break the friendship that we have and i feel that if i tell her, it would make things so awkward and weâ€™d eventually become strangers. any girls on here that can give me some tips? any advice helps. sorry for the long ass paragraph too.
