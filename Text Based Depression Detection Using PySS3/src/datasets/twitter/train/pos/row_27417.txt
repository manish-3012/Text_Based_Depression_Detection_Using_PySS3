Is this a bad situation So my ex contacted me and we been talking a lot recently (about a week) and got along great and I noticed she changed a lot and I think I have feelings for her again. We were talking the other night and we both agreed that if we started dating now instead of when we originally did we would be in a much better situation and we both knew what we did wrong and could like do better in a relationship IF we got back together and she gave off some vibes that she likes me but Iâ€™m not 100% sure
