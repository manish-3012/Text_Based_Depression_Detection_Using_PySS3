anyone here ever tried ripple+ diffusers? what are they like hey guys iâ€™m 14 and struggle with sleeping and often get stressed, i was thinking about buying a ripple+ diffuser (no nicotine) which are made for stress and anxiety, are they worth it? i need a melatonin substitute as you canâ€™t buy it in the uk :)
