Any advice for sneaking out at night? (13yr old) I am super bored in quarantine, I only have a mac to keep me entertained so most games are out of the window (I am building a pc in November) and next week I am getting a longboard and I had the idea it would be super fun to sneak out and ride it around town late at night. 

Have you ever snuck out, do you have any advice to make it easier or are there any mistakes you made?
