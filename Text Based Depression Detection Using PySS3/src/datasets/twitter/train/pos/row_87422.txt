Does anyone else get nervous when they text someone So I have these two friends Iâ€™ve known since I was a child. They are both amazing friends and like sisters to me. A few years back I moved across the country so we started texting more often. But for some reason I get really nervous when I text them. I think they might interpret something the wrong way or be mad with me, ect. I know these thoughts are irrational but in the moment I get so nervous. When waiting for a response I close my eyes and try to distract myself. 

It really sucks. These girls are my best friends. Why canâ€™t I just be normal. I feel like maybe our friendship isnâ€™t strong because Iâ€™m not completely comfortable around them. I shouldnâ€™t be like this. I shouldnâ€™t worry that they hate me when I accidentally say â€œnoâ€ instead of â€œnpâ€. 

I donâ€™t get why Iâ€™m like this and I wanted to know if anyone else struggles with this. 


Btw: Iâ€™m not nervous because I have a crush on one of them or something like that. As I stated earlier both of them are like sisters to me. Also Iâ€™m a girl and Iâ€™m straight.
