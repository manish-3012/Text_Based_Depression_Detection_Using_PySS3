Why is it that I have to hide a huge part of me to make friends?? If anyone knew completely who I am they would just leave me. It fucking sucks how even my close friends donâ€™t know completely who I am. Probably because I always get made fun of if I do something different so then I just donâ€™t do it. I just want someone to love me
