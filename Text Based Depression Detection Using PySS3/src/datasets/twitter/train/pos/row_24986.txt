My school is going back in person in 4 days. I don't understand how absolutely stupid this is. Our country has 5.6 MILLION cases of a deadly virus, my state holding a whopping 600 thousand of those cases, and the school district thinks that it's a good idea to put over 3,000 kids in a school together for 15 minutes MORE than an normal school day. I don't see how it's even POSSIBLE, at this state of the pandemic, to be so oblivious to the dangers of this virus, and the risk you are placing on your students. People could *die,* legitimately *lose their lives*, because you care more about the fucking quadratic formula than our personal safety. This here is solid proof that the whole "schools care about their students" is complete and utter bullshit. Schools don't care about your physical or mental welfare, they care about how well you do in school, because that makes *them* look good in front of the other schools. 

Obviously, schools will argue that reopening is "essential to our education", which is just more bullshit. We have proved in the past 6 months that we can do school online. Going back isn't "essential" for anything, except for the school, because going back means more money and more street cred with the other schools in my district.  None of this benefits us, it benefits the people who have already been to school and don't have to go to school in the middle of a pandemic. 

I feel bad for the teachers, too. It's not like they get a say in this. The school board is forcing them to expose themselves to a deadly virus. While they do have a choice, most will probably choose going back because they need the money to support themselves.

I give it two weeks. In two weeks from now, we will have enough cases that the school will have to close again. See you then.
