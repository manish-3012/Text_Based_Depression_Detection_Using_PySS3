Is it strange that i donâ€™t like socialising? I donâ€™t have many friends but i like it like that. I sit by myself next to a tree and watch yu-gi-oh on my phone at recess and lunch. Many people have invited me to their social group yet i never hesitate to turn them down. I havenâ€™t any trouble communicating.....yet still prefer to be by myself. Is there something wrong with me.
