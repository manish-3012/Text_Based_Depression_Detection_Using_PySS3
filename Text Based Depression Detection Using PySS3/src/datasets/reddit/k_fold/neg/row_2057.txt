i havent left my house in week i quit my job i spend a good of my day cry i dont know what s happening to me my skin took a complete 0 this year and destroyed any little self confidence i had left ha anyone else felt like this before all i can think about is my skin it taking up my life not only is it unbearable to look at it s painful and itchy and i can not afford a dermatologist looking at myself in the mirror always result in a full blown panic attack i end up hyperventilating on the floor i have cried to the point of vomiting many time i hate that it ha this power over me it s such a silly thing to worry about and i know that but it is absolutely destroying me it is a continuous cycle this constant stress only result in more breakout i feel trapped in my own skin talking about this in real life make me sound vain i wish someone would understand the cry seems to never stop and i havent slept in day now edit this wa not a suggestion for skincare tip for me it is not a simple a diet or hydration it is genetics and hormonal unfortunately
