i don t know if this is the right place to write this but before quarantine 0 9 i just thought i wa an introvert and just a very organized and methodic person but then on quarantine i started to realize that i seem to get a lot more anxious than most people and always keep thinking about stuff that happened a second ago always think about what someone s thinking about me if i did or said something wrong always think about everything that can go wrong everywhere i go memorizing the menu a week before etc and i thought the problem for a big part of the anxiety wa online class and being stuck at home with my parent they re nice tho so when i finally got to go do an exchange semester abroad i get to be outside all the time i meet new people gt the freaking anxiety is still here and that make me think that nothing is gon na make it go away but i need it to go away cause i feel like i am an introvert but i make one wrong move i just go from quiet introvert to weird and lose all the people i met i mean met that s really the right word because i just can t seem to do the right thing i don t know some of my roommate that got here the same week a me go out every night with friend and i m just stuck at the same awkward convo phase and it s not like that i scared to talk to people or i don t like talking to people i do it s just when i come back home i start to rethink every single word that i said and blame myself for the smalled little mistake i m just really lost sometimes i think what i do how i think is normal but then it doesn t i didn t even know what anxiety wa until a year or so ago so
