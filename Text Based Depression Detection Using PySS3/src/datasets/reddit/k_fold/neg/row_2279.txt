i m so tired of trying and i know i m not even trying that hard anymore i used to be more enthusiastic and put more effort in but now even if the smallest thing go wrong i give up i just don t have the strength to try anymore my self hatred ha been getting worse nothing i do is good enough i am continually disrespected by the people in my life i just don t see the point if i have to continue to struggle like this i never asked to be born so why do i have to continue suffering through life i just want to lay down and wither away i have no value anyway i m not convinced that i can continue to do this anymore
