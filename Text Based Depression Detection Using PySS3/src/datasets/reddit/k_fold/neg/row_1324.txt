i haven t had a set therapist for a year now and a much a i want to find a new one i am too scared to do so my insomnia is on the rise again and i really want someone to talk to about it my school ha an off site database for therapist that i can talk to but i guess i am just too afraid to do it i question whether they d be suitable for my case or not anxious about their technique and if i will have the same connection with them just like my previous therapist i had my previous therapist for year and it took me a year to finally open up i want to do it but i am too afraid if i don t like them i feel like i would just stay because i would not have the courage to leave
