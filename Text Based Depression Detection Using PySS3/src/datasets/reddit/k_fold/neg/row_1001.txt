in recent week i ve been starting to learn how to live with my anxiety to the point where i very minimally get anxiety anymore anxiety itself happens a couple time a week still but it s nothing i can t handle today i had an amazing day with friend and of course we drank a lot to the point where i wa very drunk at the end which is okay bc i drink more than average i m 9 anyway it wa an unforgettable day and i went to sleep drunk af boom i wake up with the biggest anxiety attack i ve had in month out of nowhere you all understand anxiety attack so hopefully you get it when i say that i wa totally convinced my body woke me up because i wa dying in my sleep or that a heart attack wa nearing now i m calming down on the couch at 0 am watching the office when i just want to sleep what i just want to get off my chest is that i hate that this stupid disorder follows me around in every aspect of my life it s just really depressing there s nothing i can do to make it stop ever it s just depressing that it s always there around the corner waiting for me i wa so proud of myself for learning how to deal with anxiety but now this shit happened to me and i just feel tired about it i honestly wouldn t wish this on my worst enemy i wouldn t wish it on anyone if i had to choose between infinite money or not having to live with anxiety ever again i d choose the latter every fucking time sorry but i just had to vent about this im just tired
