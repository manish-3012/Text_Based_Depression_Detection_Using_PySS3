hi everyone got prescribed citalopram celexa for anxiety yesterday and took my first 0mg last night i woke up a lot earlier than usual today and couldn t go back to sleep a easy i m reading about the side effect and noticed that one can be insomnia i don t know if it s the citalopram or my anxiety kicking in from reading all these side effect but i m feeling more on edge than i did the past few day at this point i m unsure about continuing a i haven t had a serious panic attack in a while and i wanted medication for low mild anxiety i do know that citalopram can eventually provide great result but i m also worried about the withdrawal symptom of coming off of it can anyone else share their first day story so i m not worrying my head off is pill enough to trigger these side effect thank you
