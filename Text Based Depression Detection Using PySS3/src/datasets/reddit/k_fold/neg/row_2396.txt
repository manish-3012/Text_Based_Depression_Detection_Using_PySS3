in today s society it seems like no one really care instead they re worried about lability litigation after something bad happens and want to shirk responsibility that being said would it be respectful to put my two week notice in before i commit suicide so they re ready for a replacement along with that it wouldn t be a big thing that would slow everyone else down i m thinking about putting in my notice i ve had everything in place and in order will service paid for everything beforehand etc i m just trying to make it easiest for the people who say they care about me along with my employer and co worker they won t be liable or responsible because they can t make me do anything
