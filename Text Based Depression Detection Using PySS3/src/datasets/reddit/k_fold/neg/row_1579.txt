i wa married for year to a man with extreme anxiety he wa my first boyfriend and husband and i had been with him since i wa a teenager so i didn t know any different i m 0 now we divorced because of his many mental issue he wouldn t get help for his depression and anxiety wa contagious and killed our marriage his parent are also extremely anxious i had always been very anxious since we had been together and i just thought that s how i wa and i couldn t change it but since we ve been separated for a while now my anxiety ha stopped not completely but most of it is gone when you re with someone who you trust and love deeply and they make trivial thing into a huge deal it mess with your perception on how to feel and react unbeknownst to me i wa depending on him to determine how i should feel i know i shouldn t have but i did because i wa young and in love and didn t know any better now that i depend on myself since i have no other choice i ve acclimated very well to handling life and situation when we would do thing together or have an issue that needed to be fixed his anxiety would make thing seem ten time worse than what they really were it s not his fault i still love him unfortunately and i m not sure i ll ever get over him but we weren t good for each other in the long haul he s such a wonderful person aside from his mental issue the world is a lot more clear now i know how to determine what is a real problem and how to handle it without the elevated emotion that come with it
