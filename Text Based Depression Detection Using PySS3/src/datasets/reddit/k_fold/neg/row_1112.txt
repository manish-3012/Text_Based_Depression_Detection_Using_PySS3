i m almost and ever since i graduated i have been lost i didn t even look at college university my parent enrolled me in admin and i got the cert two then dropped out two time cert and then a spent a year and a half at makeup school which i regret because i still can t find a job out of it i do want to start my own freelance business but it hasn t happened yet lol then at i actually pursued a hairdresser apprenticeship which i ve wanted to do for a while i ignored all those telling me it s a sht job no money what ended up happening wa working at two different salon and causing nothing but chaos to their business the first salon got rid of me after three month after repeatedly getting people wet and failing to follow instruction the way she let me off made me cry on the way home like it break my heart whenever i have to remove someone passionate about hair but today will be your last day the thing is i lied that i wa passionate about hair when really i really am not then i found a job at a salon closer to home everyone there wa a lot older than me and i found it hard to talk to them but they were understanding and very kind they wanted me to quit my waitress job to focus on my career this salon wa a lot smaller and easier than the other one whole place made up of just four chair i worked there for four month caused abit of chaos bleach dye got on customer at some point failing to follow instruction when super busy fast paced on one tragic friday they sat me down and told me some sad serious thing they said they were dissapointed for one there were a few complaint from customer i wa still getting water in someone s eye and forehead too harsh with the wash brushing that same customer ear then they told me someone had been secretly asking for someone else to wash their hair and apparently i haven t been paying attention or focusing or using my common sense and that i need to speak up that night i started to get paranoid that i wa add or had a learning disability im pretty sure i do all over again or even a lack of common sense to my mum the answer is always you don t help out at home so that s why you can t do anything at work start from home first despite all that my boss still gave me a chance and told me they still agreed to let me stat my cert in hairdressing even though i m five week behind and told me to practise washing hair instead of root colour i wa holding back tear the entire meeting right after leaving i had another mental breakdown on the way home my parent were going to leave for a birthday but then cancelled and were concerned i made an instant decision that it wasn t for me and ended up quitting over text then not going to work the next day or going to first day of tafe class the apprenticeship is supposed to be year five day in a salon and once a week in tafe a few day later they called me to come pick up my pay because they decided to under pay me and in cash until i officially started my apprenticeship they were softer this time and asked if it wa any issue with the staff or even them and i denied it all the guy told me he thought i would have come back after the talk and pulled through you know like improve fought they made me feel guilty and want to ask for a second chance to still work for them and pursue the apprenticeship my mum reminded me that i know myself if i stayed they would end up sacking me anyways my mum think it s better to quit before getting fired and getting a bad reputation it s not good for me or their business it s kind of embarassing so yeah there s my experience on trying to become a hairdresser unfortunately for me i do have a case of social anxiety and it s hard for me to speak up i also get a bit grossed out about touching an old guy hair since my first hair salon job i have cringed watching my bos fake laughing to customer how fake you have to be a well ughhh it s not for me is it now i m thinking about going back to studying admin to get an office job while waitressing on the side or i wouldn t mind being a waitress for the rest of my life just some more irrelevant rambling you don t have to read the last thing i want is to end up a factory worker like my dad which everyone in my family seems to look down on my younger bro went to uni right after high school and work towards becoming an it or something i have always been the dumb rebel sibling lol simpson s bart and lisa balance right there it s fine i ll just be the dumb pretty one like the haley character out of modern family except i m not a party girl or ever been in a relationship might a well get a boyfriend for once anytime soon each year that s passed since finishing school in 0 ha consisted of cry in my room over being a failure the first year i started to have withdrawal symptom from being let off antidepressant on the bright side unlike the other sad year i actually have a job before that it wa so hard to even land an interview i have two hospitality related job
