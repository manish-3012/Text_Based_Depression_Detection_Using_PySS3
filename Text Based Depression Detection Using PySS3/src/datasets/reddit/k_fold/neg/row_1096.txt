hey guy just kind of a nervous rant here so sorry if it s long i work at a job where it s an open and fun environment with about other people about a month ago i had a yearly review with my bos who actually ended giving me a small promotion i wa super excited and feeling optimistic my team had been performing well and our bos like to reward u with small thing if we hit our number beer on a friday buy pizza for u for a lunch day etc in the heat of the dopamine rush i wa having from the promotion i had the spontaneous idea of doing a roast for our bos in the office after work on a friday we re all fairly close a far a co worker go with each other so at the time i didn t think this seemed like a bad idea he thought it wa a good idea and said that would be fine he agreed to get food beer for it i thought awesome so i announced it at one of our weekly meeting people seemed meh about the idea but it wa on the calendar this thing is getting close and i have so much anxiety about how embarrassing and awkward this is going to be not to mention my bos usually doesn t come into work on friday but agreed to specifically for this event i know of only other guy that have a few joke written but have no clue of anyone else is even willing to participate i wasn t thinking at the time that the majority of people hate public speaking don t want to attempt comedy in front of their co worker and be taking shot at their bos on a friday after work we have fun at work but i m getting the sense that no one is really into this i think it ll end up being me up there speaking for about minute maybe getting an uncomfortable laugh or two and then having this be a gigantic failure going to be really hard to show my face at work if this doesn t pan out if you made it this far thanks for reading just had to vent and get this out there
