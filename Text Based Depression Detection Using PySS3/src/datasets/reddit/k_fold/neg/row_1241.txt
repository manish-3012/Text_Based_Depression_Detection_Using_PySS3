have had pretty good control over the most part of my anxiety up until recently when i ve been having headache again and my neck seems to have flared up it s like a sense of impending doom followed by extreme panic and the feeling of thinning i m about to die idk what it is but it s crazy usually happens before i go to sleep these weird dull hit weirdly sharp pain in the left side of my head and this weird dent on the same side of my head hope it s not cancer
