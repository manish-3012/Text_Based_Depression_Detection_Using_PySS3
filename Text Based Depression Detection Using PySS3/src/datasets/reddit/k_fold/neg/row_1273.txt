doe anyone else feel their anxiety lower when they re living in a busy home i m not sure if it s because i wa raised in a crowded home so it gave me a distraction from my worrying but now our home is about to get bigger and i m thrilled about it i always found comfort in knowing there s always someone in the house and i ll never have to be alone
