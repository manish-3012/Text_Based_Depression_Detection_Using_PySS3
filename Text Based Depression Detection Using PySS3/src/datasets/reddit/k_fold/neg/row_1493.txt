i hate how my body reacts to anxiety by making me ill this last year ha been horrible for me because of it i d say most of the time it s manageable but it s still so exhausting on an emotional and physical level usually it s the standard nausea puking headache whatever but this last three week i ve had a faux cold a in i don t actually have a cold during the part of the day i m stressed out i have horrible symptom but when i m home after school or on the weekend or if i skip because of anxiety said cold go away which is so bizarre to me because i ve had the extreme nausea diarrhea etc that come with anxiety but never sinus related i mean i end up having a terribly runny nose or having hot flash to nothing when i m able to get away from stress the other day i literally had symptom of an ear infection supposedly stress worsens your immune system and i already have allergy so this is probably how that s happening but it s just awful i want to lay down and rest for a few day a if it wa a real cold but i don t need it of course i need to figure out how to settle the emotional stress somehow but i think it s just me being anxious because it s end of the grading session typing this out gave me a headache lmao i hate all of this
