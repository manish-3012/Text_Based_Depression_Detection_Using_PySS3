so basically for a long a i can remember i have been terrible in public situation when i have to present i shake and go red but the most difficult thing thats happens is that my throat feel like it closing up and i can not get any word out even if i keep trying this lately ha progressed into seemingly random situation i think it s because im more aware of it i could be talking to some of my friend in a group and suddenly start to choke and can t speak it s made all the more confusing a when i take beta blocker i can speak fine in any situation so i guess this must mean it a mental block if anyone ha ever experienced this or could even point me in the right direction for stuff to read that would be great i have tried googling this issue but can t find anyone similar to me i m not sure if practicing talking to people work in this situation a i literally cant get the word out of my mouth when it happens thanks
