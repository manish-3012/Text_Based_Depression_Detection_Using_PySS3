it feel like ever since i wa younger i couldn t ever make myself feel a will to live for context i wa abused pretty badly by my mom at a young age hit in the face beer bottle broken over my head and all the mental shit that came with it and at my grandma took me in and then i moved into my own place at my age now 0 but the feeling never went away in fact it stayed with me and i ve always been lonely never even had my first kiss through out my life and the feeling of just shooting my fucking brain all over my wall get stronger each week i have called hotlines and it s helped a lot but i never get over it in the long run
