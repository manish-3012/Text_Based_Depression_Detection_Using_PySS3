like i can t even focus on anything my mind is always racing overthinking and obsessing this is especially annoying right now because i have my final exam coming up real soon and i need to work but i can t concentrate i hate the way i act around people i am so awkward i don t even speak just awkwardly nod whenever someone talk to me and whenever i do talk some dumb shit come out of my mouth it seems like i have started to isolate myself more and more from people and i am always moody people have started to catch on saying that i always look sad tired among other not very nice thing whenever someone asks me if i am okay i just lie and say yes nod my head awkwardly or make up some excuse i wish i could tell someone about my problem in depth but really i don t know what i would say and honestly no one would actually care and i don t blame them everyone ha their own shit going on and i don t want to bother anyone with my problem my own mother ha started to catch on to my moodiness and she ha started to yell at me and everything cause of the way i am acting i don t even think i am doing anything wrong i m just not talking and i want to be left alone i wish i could tell her but again i don t know what i would say i don t know how she would take it and i don t want to stress her out anxiety really suck i hate using these thing a an excuse cause i just want to get on with my life like everyone else
