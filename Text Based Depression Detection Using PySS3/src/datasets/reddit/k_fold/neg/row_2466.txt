no matter how many people i talk to my suicidal thought always fester in my mind a problem shared is a problem halved a complete lie i ve told people about my deteriorating mental state yet the burden still weighs on me no amount of talking will ever ease the pain i live though my situation is hopeless and i can only predict a bleak future for me all i truly want is an end to my constant mental anguish i just want peace
