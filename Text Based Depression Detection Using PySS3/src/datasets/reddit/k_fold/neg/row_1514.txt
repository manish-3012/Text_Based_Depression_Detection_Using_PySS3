i ve only known my boyfriend for month official for he ha briefly opened up about having anxiety all i know is that he ha previously been medicated for it but not currently today after i left his place he messaged to apologise incase he came off odd he wa feeling anxious for no particular reason and that it just happens sometimes i told him not to worry about it now just before i go to sleep i messaged him to see how he wa he seemed fine initially but when i asked he stopping answering so regularly i m not sure if asking him wa the right thing to do i want to make it known that i care and that i m thinking of him but i m not sure if that make it worse i have never known how to help friend with anxiety either since it seems to be so rooted in not being able to talk about it
