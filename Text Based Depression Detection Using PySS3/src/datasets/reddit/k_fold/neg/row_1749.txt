can t stop thinking i m dying of something anything all the time petrified a usual but i m also too scared to go to the doctor and the whole shebang anyway so here i am stewing in my own juice of despair agonising over all the what ifs while doing absolutely nothing about it don t you just love it ironically i feel like even if i did manage to get myself to talk to a doctor get an mri and blood work and all that dramatic stuff i still wouldn t believe them i feel so trapped
