i just need to vent a little i think it s upsetting to be a student who know the answer to your professor s question a student who want to engage in discussion but also a student unable to do so because of this silly little thing called anxiety cowardice even a i ve been told it s been an uphill battle ever since i started highschool my grade have always been decent but they re never a good a they can get because i can t speak up in class i know the answer and when i don t i can make intellectual guess not that i m boasting but it s something that i know would be well within my capability if i weren t so scared all the time whenever i m called on to recite it take everything in me to keep the shakiness out of my voice in the online set up even if the question being asked is a simple how wa your weekend i stutter and shake and sweat a if my life is on the line during face to face class i would visibly shake in front of the class and i ve lost so many point time and time again because of that the embarrassment and humiliation even if no one laugh or pick fun at me outwardly burn so badly i guess it s doubly upsetting because i ve been told that i just have no goal in life and because of that i can t bring myself to prepare for anything then proceed to cry and complain about it when i m unable to answer a question or perform well you deserve it if you re not going to do anything about it is it my fault wa being so anxious that my mind would go blank at every question a choice i do try i don t back out when i have to speak in front of the class i try my best to pretend that i m not terrified out of my wit i ve joined a quiz bee or two even if i could never bring myself to compete further than that and i want to do more i don t want the people who say i m wasting opportunity wasting my life to be right in the end maybe it s hard to believe but it s just so tiring when you see everyone around you breeze by an obstacle that you need to spend hour and day on just to overcome imagine that hyping yourself up to do a thing accomplishing it telling someone about it casually only for them to throw it back in your face because you couldn t do better than that ah what a mess
