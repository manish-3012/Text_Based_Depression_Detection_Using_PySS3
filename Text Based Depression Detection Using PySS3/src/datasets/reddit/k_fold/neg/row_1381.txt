existential crisis and angst ha become a month period drama for me every few month i will come across or think of a existential or scary thought where i ll go down a large rabbit hole and in the end become a nervous and terrified wreck i ve been through a existential crisis on mind philosophy sexuality identity apocalypse anxiety biology philosophy space anxiety and now it look like the next one will be quantum fucking physic based if i don t stop it in time i m just so sick of this cycle of fucking misery throughout my life i can t find any happiness or calmness because of my year is spent being terrified and super anxious sometimes i feel like lying down and cry but this depression ha made me so numb i can t cry anymore i just can t fucking take this anymore
