i ve been eating the same food every meal for month now bc everything else make me want to throw up and cry this is pretty normal for me so i never thought to bring it up with my psychiatrist and recently i ve been able to eat other food a well but when i sat at the table this morning i found everything repulsive even my go to food this usually only happens when my anxiety is really bad but i feel pretty ok rn so i don t know why i can t eat is this common with anxiety disorder
