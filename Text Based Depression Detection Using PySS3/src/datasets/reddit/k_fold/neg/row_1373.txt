year old male year here i ve always had a confusing relationship with myself and anxiety when i wa a young child i wa very outgoing then hit about and wa bullied because of my sensitivity and openness developed really bad anxiety a a result got to year old and found it impossible to talk to girl and wa completely sick of my shyness so i decided overnight that i wa going to showcase my confident side at all time faking it till i made it this wa a blessing and a curse because a lot of my confidence wasn t necessarily real i wa inspired by people like russell brand and keith moon and i kind of acted like them all the time now thank god i ve reached a much calmer equilibrium most people would consider me a a very confident outgoing person but i feel much more myself i m way calmer chatty and forward with people one on one but i m still plagued with anxiety in other area i have no real issue in social occasion i m the frontman in a band and we re about to go on tour playing to thousand of people and i literally have no nerve whatsoever if only this translated to everyday life firstly i m terrified of getting a new scary job working in a pub bar something with people who have the potential to be snooty and mean if i don t know what i m doing instead i live at home with my parent in a sheltered existence i work a really simple easy job at home because i m too scared of a job where i have to do something new for the first time working in a bar absolutely terrifies me but deep down i wish i had the bravery to just do it and not give a crap if i fuck up whenever i ve tried new job in the past i get so frustrated with myself when i m not my cool calm confident self in these new situation why the fuck do i take so long to get relaxed with these thing and how do i get the bravery in the first place i m just so scared that people might perceive me a being shy i guess i value my self worth on my level of confidence in that current moment my second massive issue is when i m on my own in public perhaps public transport for example i m just fizzing with anxiety constantly it s horrific in public i feel extremely self conscious i know that no one give a shit about me or care about me but i literally feel like people are judging me constantly even though i know this isn t true something a simple a cycling on a road is a fucking impossibility i m just so scared that people will think i don t know what i m doing i just hate that physical feeling of anxiety of people watching me and judging me literally sitting here with a massive stress headache because of being in public the last couple of hour i then overthink about this for hour and hour because i just don t understand how i can be this way feel like i m having a personality crisis therapy hasn t helped medication didn t should i just stfu and get on with it in essence exposure therapy how can i not care when load of people are watching me on stage but literally feel like i m dying when people look at me in public why is there this maddening split personality in me i don t think my confidence is an act because when i m confident and relaxed i would consider that to be my most normal authentic self i m not naturally a quiet person just desperately insecure and sensitive
