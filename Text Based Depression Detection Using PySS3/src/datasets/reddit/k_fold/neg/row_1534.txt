i ve had a severe anxiety problem since i wa i m now i want to make a really good effort to find what the underlying problem causing my anxiety is when i try to think about it i just catch my self thinking very negative thought that are not necessarily true i realise this isnt much to go off for a good answer but i wa wondering what s the best way to really understand what my trigger are they seem random and unprovoked most of the time thank you
