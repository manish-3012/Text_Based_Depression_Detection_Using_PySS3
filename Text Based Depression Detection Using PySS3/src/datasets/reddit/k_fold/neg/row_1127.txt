hello everyone new to the sub here i would like to receive your insight about my recent discovery about myself tw self h so i used to do this when i wa and it mostly because i have severe anxiety and i need a coping mechanism ive stopped and have been cleaned for year since today i had a fight with my entire family about not respecting my boundary and not coming into my room when im literally shirtless and they make fun of me for being too serious about it theyre good people and have never touched me inappropriately so i too wa puzzled about my sudden anxiety attack so i locked myself in a room sobbing to no one and i felt so much pain and i just want the rush to come but then i saw a resistance band and literally did a thousand bicep curl and u know how it burn when someone exercise the first time i couldnt feel my hand i guess the endorphin made me feel so much better i forgot about wanting to do that bad thing i feel so much better and i wanted to know if i could do a thousand bicep curl at the risk of injuring my hand to avoid doing what i used to do
