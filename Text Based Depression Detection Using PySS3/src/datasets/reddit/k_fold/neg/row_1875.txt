i m sick of hearing these are your best year and it only get worse i m year old i m in highschool and every adult in my life insists that it doesn t get any better than this i m told that a i get older get a job a house debt more responsibility i ll only get more stressed school alone coupled with my anxiety is enough to make getting through a single day a struggle i m fortunate enough to have a very good home life my greatest struggle ha been and continues to be with myself i m afraid that once i move on to life past highschool and i no longer have a strong support system i will collapse in on myself if you struggled with mental health in highschool when you were younger ha life a an adult improved for you doe it get any easier
