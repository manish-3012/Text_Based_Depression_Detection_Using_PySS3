hey recently i realised that i ve been having one problem for a couple of year but i wasn t able to identify and name it until now so basically when i talk to someone directly i have no problem in holding eye contact it just feel natural no anxiety at all no matter if it s someone i know or some stranger however i m facing lot of situation when i feel unable to look around like in library where i literally feel some kind of mental block to look at someone sitting beside me or someone passing by sometimes i experience that also in public transport or at the gym i usually try to combat that feeling by looking there anyway but it just feel even more uncomfortable and i feel that this discomfort make me look like some sort of creep how do you even approach such problem
