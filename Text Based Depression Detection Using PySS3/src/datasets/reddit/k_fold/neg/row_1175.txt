i just got back from a hour cycle enjoying the sun and i got in and had lunch and i started to feel so fatigued uneasy head fogginess it the strangest feeling to explain but it so horrible ive had this feeling a few time before it like ill sit on the sofa and ill have no will to move and the thought of getting up is overwhelming it feel like my health anxiety worry over normal stuff like being fatigued if i think more rationally and consider ive been going on hour cycle ride for the past day and ive been sleeping like crap ive been doing something quite intensive and then not allowing my body to recover through dodgy sleep plus on top of bad anxiety what is already quite exhausting
