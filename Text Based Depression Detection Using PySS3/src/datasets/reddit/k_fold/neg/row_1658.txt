i m a year old male and today is the last day to drop out of uni without paying for the semester i ve been trying to get this degree for a long time and i finally seemed to be on track until last year when my year relationship ended and i wa basically unable to function let alone study properly so now i ve still got full year left to complete and i just can t come to term with staying broke for that long at this age until i ve finished furthermore i m not medicated for my adhd because i couldn t deal with the side effect it s overwhelmingly frustrating and shameful because i know i m intelligent and it s an interesting degree the other thing is i ve basically told my friend and family that there s only year left for some absolutely dumb reason being at uni gave me at least something to tell people that i wa working towards now i m going to have to accept that i m a complete failure with a massive debt if anyone wa in a similar situation or ha advice i d love to hear about it peace
