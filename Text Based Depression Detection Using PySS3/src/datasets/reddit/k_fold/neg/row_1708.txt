hi i m f i wouldn t say i have an ed but i do have anxiety over food and weight i ve been told i m slim and it want it to stay that way however my parent don t seem to fully get that my dad like to make all my meal which upset me bc his food isn t the healthiest like today he made me a sandwich w a lot of mayonnaise which got me into a rage filled episode where i punched my leg multiple time and couldn t stop cry tho i did they in the bathroom by myself then afterwards he made me ice cream and that scared me even more so i aggressively worked out and punched my leg i get so anxious that i ll get bigger and so all i can think abt is food i ve tried to talk to my dad but he doesn t appreciate it he enjoys making me food my anxiety is getting so bad
