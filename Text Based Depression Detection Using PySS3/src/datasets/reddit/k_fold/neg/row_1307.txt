i ve been woth my boyfriend for two year now but i ve known him for he get triggered fairly fast and he end up feeling anxious for hour or he get very intense anxiety attack where he can t breathe well and he start cry uncontrollably the first thing i used to do when i sense that he s getting anxious wa give him a hug or even just hold his hand physical touch seemed to help him so much it immediately calmed him down and he would be able to talk about what wa making him feel scared or overwhelmed or threatened however we re now in a long distance relationship and i haven t seen him in a year it s very difficult for both of u but this specifically make it unbearable at time we both know that we ll see each other soon but saying that doesn t help when he s anxious what should i do
