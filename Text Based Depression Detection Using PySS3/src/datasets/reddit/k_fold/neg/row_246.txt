i am on the train with feeling of regret sadness lonliness disappointment and nostalgia most importantly dealing with uncertainty about the future we could die tomorrow thus the train crashed killing me i could end up homeless i could end up penniless i could end up in a wheelchair i could be super disabled i m just trying to make good with what i have and to not be sorry for what i don t hope is an addictive drug that stimulates dopamine but depression give me doubt
