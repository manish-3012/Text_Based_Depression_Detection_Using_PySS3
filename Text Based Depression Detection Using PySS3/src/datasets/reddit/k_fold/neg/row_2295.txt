i lost my ambition when i wa somewhat and now we re 0 going on failed everything don t know what to do or who to talk to i told myself in september that if i end up in the same position i wa in the year prior i d kill myself seeing a i wa unable to find some shred of purpose then time ha repeated itself and now i m obviously anxious about it but i don t know if i can find another purpose because of the backlash i would receive from my family for wasting their time i told myself thing would be different but they never changed even if i tried my best to change them so if this is my last post then it s my last post i chose reddit i just hope in the next life if there is one that god at least give me more willpower and or intelligence because i honestly can not traverse this planet in this meatbag
