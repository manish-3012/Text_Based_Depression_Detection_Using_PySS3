so at the place where i work we had a new girl started off okay work got crazy and we were under the impression she had it under control question were minimal she seemed okay then she wa out sick and we had to take over her desk and long story short there were several thing found that made her a liability and could possibly get u sued by our customer thankfully all thing were corrected and we re okay but now they want to fire her it wa decided that she s out a soon a she s ready to come back from being sick i feel so bad and anxious about this which i voiced to my supervisor who happens to be my mom i said that i didn t feel bad she wa being fired because she deserves it for the huge mistake she s repeatedly been making i feel bad because she s at home having a hard time allegedly but think that she still ha a job like if that wa me i d probably never recover i noticed this anxiety ha me wondering if my relationship is happening the same way where i ll find out later with seemingly no warning that it s not okay and i m fired it s just so hard and i feel so bad but a much a i try to distance myself i can t and i don t know how to make this stop
