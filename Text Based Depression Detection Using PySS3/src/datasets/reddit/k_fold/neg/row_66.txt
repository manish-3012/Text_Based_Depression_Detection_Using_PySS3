lately i ve had very strong feeling of hopelessness like i m just wasting my life away i don t want to be around people most of the time i purposely try to avoid social situation i also noticed that if i m feeling an emotion such a anger i can feel it throughout my entire body i m tired of isolating myself and feeling like my life isn t worth anything i ve had thought of not wanting to be here anymore but i know that i won t act on it i hate feeling this way and i don t know what to do to fix it i ve gone to a psychiatrist but i feel like they don t really listen to what s going on and they are more worried about the medication i m taking if anyone ha any suggestion or natural remedy please share i m tired of feeling this way
