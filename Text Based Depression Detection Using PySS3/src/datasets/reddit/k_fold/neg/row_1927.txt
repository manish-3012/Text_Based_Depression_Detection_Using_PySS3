i feel like i am getting closer to giving up everyday and i can help myself it like i am watching a ship slowly sink i don t think i will see my next birthday i know myself pretty well and i know i can t hold on for much longer i feel like a cancer patient with few month to live i have had suicidal thought before but nothing like this it feel like i am already dead
