hi with my anxiety the grocery store ha been a tough place for me i ve managed by going at off peak time so there aren t a many people around dressing in layer in case i get too hot and wearing headphone or ear plug to block out noise my last issue is the fluorescent light they bother me a lot any tip besides wearing sunglass indoors when the sun isn t out and having people stare at me lol
