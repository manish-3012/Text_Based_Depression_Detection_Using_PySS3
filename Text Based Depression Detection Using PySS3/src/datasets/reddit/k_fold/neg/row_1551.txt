hi my first post here i m a 0f who ha been diagnosed with anxiety and mild agoraphobia in july last year i ve been on medication ever since and it ha significantly improved my condition i attend university hang out with my friend go on date with my long term girlfriend and haven t had a full blown panic attack since january so in a way i ve never been better the problem is that despite my improved condition i still get highly anxious when i m anticipating something mainly date but sometimes also outing with friend when we have more formal plan in the morning i wake up feeling jittery and can not focus on anything i often feel cold and shaky my hand tremble awfully and in the worst case i have an upset stomach right of the bat then a i m on the train or a tram just second before the meeting i start feeling hot nauseous and lightheaded when we finally meet the panic reach it peak and i very often nearly throw up nausea and diarrhea are the symptom that terrify me the most and then it s over it take some time for me to calm down but this kind of intensity of symptom doesn t come back anymore it happens mostly when i go on date when my s o visit me or when i m hanging out with a completely new friend which is annoying because i feel safe and comfortable around her she understands my condition and helped me through it when i wa at my lowest and could barely leave my house but for some reason she still trigger my anticipatory anxiety the most it doesn t happen always not to this extent at least but i m always at least a little bit shaky and nauseous at the beginning and the not knowing whether i ll be okay or not okay on a certain day is in itself nerve wrecking to put thing in perspective i used to get anxiety attack even when making plan through text message just setting up a meeting could send me spiralling down now doesn t phase me anymore so a you see i m much better now ha anyone experienced something similar
