a lot of post and answer here are about health anxiety which i don t have or social anxiety which i do have but isn t the problem most of the time i ve had really bad anxiety for a long a i can remember and it s only starting to get better now that i ve been taking antidepressant for about a month but i just don t understand where the anxiety is coming from and even what it is about i don t know what i m afraid of i couldn t tell you what i m stressed out about recently my therapist told me my anxiety come from an obsessive disorder but not like ocd he explained it wa only mental but i still don t get it so i guess my question is doe anybody else here have that kind of anxiety and could you explain it to me it just drive me crazy to have my life ruined by something that doesn t make any sense
