my spouse say they are a highly sensitive person based on some reading that they have done they re also a mental health professional so they may not be jumping to conclusion too soon but i have some concern they have a lot of mood swing low self esteem and self confidence when they re not working they re almost always doom scrolling on instagram they have no interest in outdoor activity and they re also easily affected by the issue of client they see a a part of their job i see all this and tell them that they may need to see a therapist themselves because i had similar symptom and got mental health help myself but i m almost always met with a snappy response saying that they re just highly sensitive and don t see the need for therapy thought anyone
