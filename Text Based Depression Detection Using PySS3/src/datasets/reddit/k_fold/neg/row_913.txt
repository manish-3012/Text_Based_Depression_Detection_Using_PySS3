so i m f and i finished college right when the pandemic hit march 0 0 so my internship got cancelled and i ended up getting no experience in my field i work in fast food and decided to wait a bit before job hunting cause the pandemic made everything crazy and i felt safe where i wa i also wa considering going back to school cause i wa uncertain if i wanted to stick with my degree but i ve decided i ll only go back if i find something i know i ll be passionate about and i haven t fast forward to year later and i ve hit my limit and started to seriously job hunt because i can t stand working in fast food anymore my parent treat me like i m a loser for still working there and tell me i need to get my life together and make it clear they want me to move out in a few year they don t need to treat me like that at all because trust me i hate my job it make me so miserable and my depression ha been so bad this winter because of it i ve felt like life isn t worth living and i have this horrible fantasy of getting into a car crash etc just so i don t have to work i apply to job day after day but never even get any interview and i m trying to be patient but none of these job want to hire someone with 0 experience in the field and it s so unfair how am i ever supposed to start and get experience when they all want someone with year i wa so close to quitting my job this weekend cause i ve hit my limit with how understaffed we always are and how rude customer and manager are but i can t afford it so i either have to stay patient and suffer through my current job or maybe leave it for something else while i still continue to look for a office job but i feel like any retail job would be just a bad so i don t know what to do this job is sucking the life out of me and i feel so burnt out every single day when i get home i never have energy to game much which is my biggest hobby and i feel so negatively about myself for still working there at my age and my parent make me feel so much worse with their rude comment i m just feeling really discouraged and mad at myself for only starting to look for a new job now but i can t go back and change the past and i know job hunting can take awhile and persistence but it s just so hard when you work a really toxic job and want to leave so badly but can t cause you need the money so you feel trapped if i had the money tbh i would go back to college cause i loved college i loved how i felt like i wa open to so many possibility and loved how it felt like i wa learning new thing everyday and now i feel so trapped and suffocated but it s too late and i need to stick with the degree i got
