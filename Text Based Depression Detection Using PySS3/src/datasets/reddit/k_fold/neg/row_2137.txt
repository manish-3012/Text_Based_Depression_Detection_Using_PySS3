i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that
