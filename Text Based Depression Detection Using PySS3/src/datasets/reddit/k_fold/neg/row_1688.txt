to be fair i don t have access to much of my family s history past my parent so i don t know if there s a possibility that someone in my family tree had anxiety but when i wa younger i remember taking online test about anxiety because i couldn t see a therapist then worrying about the result did i somehow create my anxiety by self diagnosis then spin it into the real thing
