hi last year in matheletics i managed to bag at least top 0 but suddenly this year my playing condition have dropped because when i look at the leaderboard every time it make me more anxious and lead to bad performance in the competition now i can not even reach top 000 this ha been making me more stressed and now i even have mixed feeling to never take part in any of these competition even though it thing that i like are there any way to at least calm myself down
