m no underlying physical health issue known i started taking 0mg propranolol a few week ago missing some day and on others taking tablet when needed they have deffo helped relieve that horrible fight or flight feeling however two side effect i can t stop thinking about which don t seem to be mentioned in the leaflet are the odd heart palpitation and possibly a bit of a cough these typically occur hour after taking the tablet sometimes i don t experience these symptom on others they re quite noticeable i do feel really calm and relaxed after taking them and don t want benzo s ssri but when i experience the heart palpitation i freak out also the cough is kind of worrying too it could be a coincidence i did have covid month ago google of course mention load of other possibility which is nerving anyone else been in a similar boat i thought beta blocker were meant to prevent heart palpitation
