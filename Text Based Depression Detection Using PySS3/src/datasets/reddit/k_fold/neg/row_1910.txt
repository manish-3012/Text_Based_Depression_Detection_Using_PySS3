i m f currently on a work trip with a few of my coworkers most of whom i ve known for year but haven t seen in person since covid started i m decently close with one person in particular and the rest i just have a normal professional relationship with last night everyone went out to celebrate a big milestone during the trip and had a great time i wa definitely pretty drunk by the end of the night and getting home is a little hazy but i woke up with good memory of the night before and wasn t concerned that anything had happened anyways no one had texted me this morning and i wasn t sure what the plan for the day wa so i reached out to the coworker i m closer with and asked what she wa up to she said she wa going to breakfast with another person on the trip and that i could come which i agreed to but then she texted and said they were actually leaving right now for breakfast and that we could meet up later this seemed odd to me since we re all in the same hotel and i could have been ready to head out whenever but it felt like she didn t want me to come i think i m reading into it a bit too much but now i m freaking out worried that i did something wrong last night and that s the reason i m not being invited along today i don t really have a track record of doing thing out of character while drunk though so i m just really confused and anxious tldr got drunk with coworkers who i haven t seen in a while and now it feel like no one want to hang out with me
