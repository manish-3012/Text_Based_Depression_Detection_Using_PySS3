i ve been feeling this way for close to a year at this point but it ha gotten worst within the last few week i feel that i am unable to calm down and i m in a constant state of panic at first i passed this off a just stress from school from being behind on assignment but i m all caught up with work now and i just feel even worse my heart ha been racing for literal hour and this kind of thing happens way too regularly now i m also really struggling from being in recovery from an eating disorder and i ve struggled with depression really badly for about a year about a year ago i also went through a traumatic event that cause me to panic whenever i hear any urgent voice from another room im just so done with feeling this way and keeping it to myself all the time and i want some validation for my stress
