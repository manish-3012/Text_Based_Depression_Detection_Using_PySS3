i have been trying to drop in on a ramp every time i do it in the last second i lean back and fall i can simulate it in my head but my fear or anxiety prevents me i literally went skydiving last week but i can not get myself to do a simple trick i ve fallen plenty of time so what s the worst thing that can happen it s weird how fear is relative i go skydiving one week and the next week i get nervous while driving or when talking to a girl one ha more fatal consequence while the other one just make me nervous i want to conquer all fear but trying new thing is always stressful
