i hate myself right now because of my anxiety i hate the anxiety and i hate that it make me hate myself i hate that i didn t ask to have anxiety i hate that i didn t ask to be raised in a culty religion that wired my brain to have such a narrow view of the world i hate that i wa raised in that religion by a manipulative mother so now it is difficult to believe anyone i just freaking hate it all ultimately i hate myself for hating myself because i didn t cause this and i shouldn t have to suffer because of how other people treated me
