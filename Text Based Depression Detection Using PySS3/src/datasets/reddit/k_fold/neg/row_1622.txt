so i m just going to get this off my chest i m and in one evening in the beginning of november i went to go to sleep and felt like i couldn t breath i got up and wa sweating super fucking restless so it wa like a mini panic attack this panic attack ha marked the most torturous month of my life i wake up in the morning and the first feeling i have is a racing heart that anxious feeling in my chest shortness of breath and it last constantly until i have to take sleep aid to calm me down enough to sleep at night i don t understand why me i eat healthy i exercise and there is no family history of anxiety it suck because i m not anxious about anything in particular it s the feeling so i ve been sort of surviving on benzos not everyday probs a few time a week since then with lapse of about a week or so when i can t get any i just have been taking them to prevent the fucking anxiety starting i did have little time at the end of dec and around january feb for a week or two where i feel like it did go away but that might have been because i had benzos in my system and that s why i felt ok i ve been purposely cutting down my benzo use so last week i used on monday and didn t use until friday i felt severe anxiety all of those day but didn t crave the drug or have any withdrawal i only took them on friday because i just wanted a fucking rest it s so stressful to feel like this all the time i get so scared it s never going to go away i want to start an ssri but they take like week to work i can t wait that long sorry for the rant
