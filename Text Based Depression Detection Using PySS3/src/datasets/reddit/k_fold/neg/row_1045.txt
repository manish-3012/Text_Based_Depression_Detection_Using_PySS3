two day ago i got the biontech vaccine my third dose on the night immediately after i got the vaccine i had a celsius degree fever on the next day it went down a bit i think it wa ish but wa evidently better than my first day today i still felt a bit hot and i checked my temperature to be around a well yet i don t feel super unwell just sometimes i would feel my body is a bit warmer than usual may i ask if this is okay people say that if your fever doe not go away hour after vaccination something is wrong but i don t have any other symptom no pain no fatigue whatsoever may i ask if this is something that i should be concerned about
