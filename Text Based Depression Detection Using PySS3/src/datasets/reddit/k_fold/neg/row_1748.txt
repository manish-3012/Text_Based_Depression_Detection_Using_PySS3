i believe it s a psychosomatic symptom in my arm but what s it called when you overthink about a limb and hyperfocus on it it feel weird like nothing actually wrong but it s a constant focus because you re thinking about it it s like if you overthink about a word it start to sound weird i hope that make sense i m not really sure how to refocus my attention off of my left hand feeling uncoordinated when it s not but it feel like it is like i m hyper aware my left hand exists and i know that sound so silly but any insight on how to stop this or redirect my thinking i don t feel like being in this rut any longer
