i ve never been one to feel anxious or thought of having anxiety even during difficult time however this past week i ve been struggling so much and realized i m suffering from anxiety long story short i met someone about month ago i knew in the first date just that gut feeling she s the one it wa great perfect everything i wanted but not long after she unfortunately suffered great trauma with the loss of her best friend her sister in the beginning it wa manageable and i think it it wa mainly due to her denial she lost her sister eventually the grief settled in and now the true challenge arose for her anxiety yr prior she lost her cousin and still had not gotten over it now after losing loved one she had the fear of losing me created turmoil between u jealousy trust issue it created anger in me i felt like a monster she wanted me to be understanding and working with her where i wa foolish and expected her to get rid of it that is my biggest regret thing got worse for u add the fact covid put a huge mental strain on u i also lost a family member during that time that wa dear to me and the stress of still trying to accept a different work culture a i changed from being out and about in the field 0hrs a week to stuck at a desk working from home this created a ton of anger and frustration in me this wa also part of our downfall a few month back i stepped away from our relationship her fear of losing me and constantly keeping me on her mind prevented her from working on herself i knew she would not heal and work on herself so long a i wa around i felt that wa the best decision i lied to her i told her i didn t love her anymore i wa trying to protect her my second biggest regret two week ago i reached out to her after working hard on my personal self to remove my anger do better for myself with my eating better working out but i also made plan a plan to ensure everything that went wrong would never happen again i knew she wa still my soul mate i knew she wa still the love of my life i knew she wa still my bae we had coffee chatted i told her i wanted her back in my life and had a plan and would do whatever it took to get her back she told me we would get back together but she needed time she wa in conflict and fear of losing me again fear of her anxiety being an issue for u again and her just being her old self i respected that and told her i would do anything for her i told her i d wait week later after a week of confusion emotion uncertainty her feeling changed she knew she loved me still and care deeply but that fear of what happened in the past and her uncertainty in her own well being made her change her mind and she had guilt telling me we would when she is uncertain we could ever get back together i suffer of fear of losing her i suffer of regret of everything i wish i did differently i fear she may hurt even more if we don t try and she end up having regret i know we weren t working a a team i know we needed to collaborate more but i know i gave her so many change a she kept begging me please give me one more chance i just now have to live with fear regret and wish she would just give me chance we promised to stay in touch very limited maybe call a week she still care for me and still want me in her life but she need to focus on her i will wait for her she know it even though i know i ll continue to suffer with that fear and regret but right now she is hurting right now she is in pain so right now the best thing for me to do no matter how hard it is is to be the best support person for her it s what she need and i ll do anything for her
