whatever sound i hear keep on repeating in my head in an endless loop to the point where if i m in a loud room like the shower or air conditioning is on i start hearing that sound that s looping in my head outside of my mind almost like it warp the real sound and convert it into the sound i hear in my mind i am always very well aware that it s just my head and that it s just the sound repeating although my anxiety can t stop worrying about it being psychosis anyone that can help me i would call my psychiatrist but she doesn t work today so this is my other best option
