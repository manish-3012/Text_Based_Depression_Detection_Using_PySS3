i m not a big fan of sharing overly personal stuff online so i ll just say that i ll have to take a moderately long plane ride soon a couple week from now i think and every day i have at least one mini panic attack worrying about it there are some minor complication that could happen to me on the flight but nothing particularly harmful or super bad in any sense i m mostly concerned about anxiety claustrophobia and the side effect of that while on the flight this is stressful and feel pointless a i know from past experience i never know how i ll feel until i m there or in this case in the anxiety inducing situation any advice
