i wa in my car actually but it wa a bad time to start cry i know it sound pathetic but i felt my emotion build up and started remembering thing i shouldn t remember then my tear started flowing the worst part wa making sure my eye didn t look red before going out in public this happens to me a lot and i can hardly control it i ve always thought cry make you weak but a it turn out i cry a lot for someone who look down on it i feel like a pathetic po and even more so for being a grown as 0 year old woman
