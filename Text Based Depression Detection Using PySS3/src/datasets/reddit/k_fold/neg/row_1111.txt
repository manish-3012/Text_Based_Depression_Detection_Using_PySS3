i m not sure where to even post this but i m hoping someone who read this can relate for the past month everything feel wrong or off but there is objectively nothing wrong i started a new long awaited and anticipated job and quit my horribly toxic previous work place this wa the moment i had fantasized about for the last few year but ever since then i can t seem to feel ok everything feel chaotic and out of place but nothing else ha changed i am on a good routine but i still feel out of control again absolutely nothing is out of control in fact looking from the outside in my family is in one of the best stage of life we have been in why can t i seem to feel at home or grounded i feel a constant longing for something but i have no clue what it is i can t come up with a solution to this feeling because when i think about it logically i can t find anything to fix i just can t feel ok
