so i would describe myself a someone who is pretty high functioning in term of living with moderate anxiety although in certain triggering situation it can become completely debilitating and a huge obstacle to making progress in my life on wednesday i have a job interview and i am just nauseated and so anxious even thinking about it it s only 0 minute long but i think it s 0 0 whether i ll straight up have a panic attack during the interview and i m absolutely dreading it the inability to speak to think in a straight line to remember anything to breathe properly feeling totally disoriented i m not trying to manifest it here but it s just the reality of how my body reacts to these situation and in year of my working life i have never come close to conquering it i have a wonderful partner i have been with for nearly a year now but she ha never really seen what anxiety can do to me when it get bad i guess i ve just been really good at avoiding situation that trigger it she s very sympathetic and encourages me to prepare but it s clear she fundamentally doesn t know what it s like to be debilitated by situation to the point of panic attack i tried to explain but she think if i prep then i ll just be able to speak without issue but it just doesn t work like that for me at all prep can only get me so far and half the time i ll just get a few sentence out then descend into panic i am so anxious just thinking about wednesday that i ve barely made progress with my prep anyway although i ll try my best to do some more over the next couple of day sorry this is just a rant and isn t a very meaningful post i guess i m just desperate for people to understand how horrible it is to feel so anxious and to know you re basically setting yourself up for a potential panic attack with an audience hope i can find my courage to get through it
