i tried to end my misery last week but my boyfriend intervened since then he told me he is emotionally checked out but yet we are still together i m so confused he won t touch me or kiss me he rarely smile at me or converse with me when he get home from work i feel so alone i literally have no one to all to about how i feel or what i am going through besides my dog
