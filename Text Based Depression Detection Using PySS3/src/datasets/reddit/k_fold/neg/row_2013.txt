feeling really cynical about it my life is a fucking mess been two week i don t sleep getting crazier and crazier everyday but don t have any room for taking care of myself because of a 0h week study contest to come and even my weekend being splitted between people i need to see right now just thinking i ll kill myself after all these contest if i don t blow up before then taking rest is a no no i have diagnosed disability that my teacher don t care about dying seem like my only escape and comforting thought
