i have been going to therapy for roughly year now and i feel like it isn t helping i have minute appointment bi weekly but i feel like the minute isn t enough time for me it take a bit more time each appointment to get recomfortable with a therapist if that make sense by the time i feel comfortable we barely get into anything important and i leave feeling unsatisfied i ve seen multiple different therapist and this is common with all of them i feel like i might need to find a new provider who doesn t follow this protocol but this is a common practice in my area doe anyone have advice on how to break through the awkward part each time and get down to what i need help with are there therapist out there who see people for more than min hr at a time
