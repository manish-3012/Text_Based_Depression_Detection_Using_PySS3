having difficulty swallowing fear or choking always needing water beside me wa one of my first symptom of anxiety before i knew i had anxiety that wa about year ago and that symptom still follows me around and is one of the most annoying symptom my anxiety ha manifested over the year and i ve had it all but i just realized that when eating chocolate i don t have the same fear a any other food i can swallow chocolate perfectly fine put a plate of food in front of me and on my worst day it take me forever or i can t eat put chocolate in front of me and i can eat it easily quickly and without fear seems odd i wonder if it s due to the reward center in your brain when you eat sugar more or le curious if this is common or just me
