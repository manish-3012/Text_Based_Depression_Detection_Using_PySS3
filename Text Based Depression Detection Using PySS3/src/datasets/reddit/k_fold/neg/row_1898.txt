i have a constant paranoia of having rabies normally i can distract myself and just not think about it but if i get reminded of it i m worrying about having it i don t think i ve ever bitten by a wild animal and definitely not one that had rabies plus my country hasn t had a rabies case in year the last one being a dead fox found in the wood i have no idea why i keep worrying about it but i do and i keep wondering whether it s related to anxiety or something else
