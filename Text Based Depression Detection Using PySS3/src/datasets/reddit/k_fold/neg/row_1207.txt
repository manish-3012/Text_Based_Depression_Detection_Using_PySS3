just to start off i do work but i really don t want to for some reason i get a crazy amount of dread when thinking about working especially going into a shift i especially have anxiety thinking about how it mess with my schedule i had a really bad experience with a lazy employer and i would work totally alone for shift without much instruction it wasn t very bad but my anxiety would not leave me alone it keep me up at night and that s really hard to do because i fall asleep in literal second i don t even know where to go from here everyone i tell this to say i have to work a if i will never get a job for this reason even when i specifically say i will work but i won t like it
