i have been struggling with anxiety and panic attack for most of my life but i finally seem to have gotten a handle on it for the time being i still have stress and anxiety from time to time but the panic attack are much le frequent i actually can t remember when i last had one and i used to have them a lot and when they do come i m better able to handle them so i ve been able to get out into the world a bit more now but there is one problem that is still lingering from when i wa more anxious i can t tell whether my desire to say no to certain thing is because i genuinely don t want to do it or because of anxiety although i wouldn t call myself agoraphobic anymore i still always have the automatic urge to say no to anything anyone asks me to do i understand that about myself and usually it s enough to give myself some time to think it over or not think about it at all and then i m able to decide that it is actually something i wanted to do i am just nervous but lately i ve been feeling this intense urge to avoid doing certain thing and i don t know if it s because my anxiety is creeping back in or because i just don t want to do them my mind tell me i just don t want to but a you all know our mind are not always the best reference for example i moved from the u to italy and i finally mustered up the courage to join a book club in my new town to try to make some friend here the other member are italian but we all discus the book in english which is awesome because i can speak more freely that way i wa really anxious the first time but it turned out to be great it wa really fun and i couldn t wait to go again until right before the next meeting when i got anxious again again it wa fine though and this happened three or four time but every time i wa actually at the book club i wasn t anxious the only problem wa the anticipation but after the first couple meeting the book club itself started to be le enjoyable aside from one or two other member no one is very nice or talkative and hardly anyone read the book and for the last few meeting we have only discussed depressing and completely unrelated to the book thing like war and death and covid all the thing i read and go to the book club to escape from for a while also my being american apparently make me like an ambassador and the leader of the group keep asking me for the american opinion on this or what this or that is like in america and i usually have to tell them about stuff that isn t great like health care police brutality issue etc it isn t fun anymore and there is also the added problem of the leader of the book club sending me message outside the group asking me to edit her assignment she ha to do for a magazine and while she s way over the top with her gratitude about it i feel like she is just using me which is making me not want to go even more so now every time there is a meeting coming up i again get that feeling like i don t want to go but now i m thinking i might just genuinely not want to go because it s not fun not just because of the anticipatory anxiety last time i actually skipped it but i felt the same kind of guilty feeling i feel when i skip something because i m anxious this week there s another meeting and again i just don t want to go even though i read the book but i don t know if i should push through it and see if it s a better meeting this time or just listen to my gut and skip it again and or quit the club i really wanted it to be good though because i love book and i wa hoping to make friend here doe anyone have any advice tl dr how do you tell the difference between not wanting to do something because of anxiety and just not wanting to do it when you can t trust your own gut to tell you
