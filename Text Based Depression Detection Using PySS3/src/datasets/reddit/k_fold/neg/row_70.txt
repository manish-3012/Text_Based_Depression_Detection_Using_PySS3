i am a male who should be having the time of his life in college meeting new people getting a degree experiencing all that life ha to offer in reality i dont want to be here any more i feel that i am in people life to help them through their stuff and then one they re fix im out of their life i feel like there are maybe people in the world that would miss me if i wasn t here i feel like everything i do on a daily basis is to keep an appearance that i want to live and that i am doing thing for me i have never been this close to just accepting the fact and just not waking up tomorrow i know it might hurt some people that i know but i am dont suffering in silence and i am done with this facade that i have to keep up every single day of my life my life feel like it is on repeat the same thing happen and i dont feel anything besides not wanting to be here i dont feel emotion like others do i can go from laughing like im about to cry to a straight face within second i dont feel sadness i dont feel happiness like others i am in a constant state of numbness i dont want to play this game anymore im done with it there no one i trust that i can share this with and no one in my life truly understands this
