i ve made phenomenal progress with my anxiety issue over the decade but one thing ha gotten worse and i m not sure what to call it if i start a train of thought and i suddenly remember something traumatic or embarrassing or unpleasant i start to feel bad and i start to say thing out loud when i say the thing it seems to release pressure so that it s easier for me to stop thinking about what upset me it s usually something like no or amen although it cycle and it s been worse thing like i hate myself or i want to die it s annoying enough when i do it by myself but i ve started doing it with my husband or child around and it worry me to know he s hearing me say these thing is this actually a kind of tic if not what is it doe anyone else do this
