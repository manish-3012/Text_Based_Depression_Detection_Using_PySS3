my on and off boyfriend of two year left me after i got diagnosed with bpd le that two week ago he decided to read the bplovedones subreddit and like yeah i will not invalidate their experience but the way they speak of people with bpd is dehumanizing everything seemed fine sunday and then he read the stuff monday and dipped on tuesday i don t want to be alive because i don t want to hurt anyone else and i feel so disconnected from the world it s not because he left it s because i feel so alone and i don t want to hurt and i don t want to hurt anyone else i also feel so guilty for the shitty thing i did do i m worried i will never change and die alone i don t know who would love someone like me after what i have done
