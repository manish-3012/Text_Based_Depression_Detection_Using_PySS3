feel anxious when i dont follow my routine exactly for example i usually do the same task at work but do know how to do other task non are hard and take a few day to learn but however whenever i deviate from what i normally do i feel anxious that something bad will happen it doesnt make sense because i have done it before and have experience but still feel scared
