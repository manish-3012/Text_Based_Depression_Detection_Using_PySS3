just recently moved into a small condo to be someone s caregiver and i have my own space but i am constantly worried about my neighbor especially the one bellow and above me i worry about every single conversation being overheard and listened to i worry that a a bigger guy i sound like an elephant walking to those bellow i worry that the fancy sound bar and subwoofer i bought before moving wa even an idea is too loud even at quiet level i hate this i feel like i am worried about every single nosie i make i am so used to living in a house with space between each one back when i could blast my music or watch movie with the bass turned up now i am paranoid of watching horror movie because i am afraid that one of my neighbor is going to hear scream and think something weird is going on or hell watching pretty much anything else because i don t want to be annoying i know this is all irrational i know the floor and wall are probably thicker then i think but anxiety won t let me relax i am just paranoid about every sound i make here
