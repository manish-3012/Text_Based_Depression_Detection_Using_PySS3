i struggle with boundary i either come across a defensive or a complete push over and people pleaser and both of these behaviour come from a place of fear and anxiety i always have self doubt and in conflict with others i straight away believe i have done something wrong and it s not until later i realise i haven t i feel my anxiety wa life long but worsened by an abusive relationship in which i lost any sense of self or autonomy how have you worked through your anxiety to come to a place of self compassion self esteem and healthy boundary i feel unable to find the balance thanks so much in advance
