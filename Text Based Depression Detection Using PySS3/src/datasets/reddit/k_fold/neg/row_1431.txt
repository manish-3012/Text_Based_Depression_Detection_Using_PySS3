i just read this line somewhere the problem with silence is that it s usually not complete it got me thinking how i usually like to drown the noise around me by playing some music in the background the noise make me anxious or irritable at time but then i would probably not be able withstand complete silence a well because then i d be left alone with my thought which isn t exactly comforting and i sometimes get anxious if i completely cut off outside world because then i m anxious about not knowing what s happening out there damn it s frustrating any of you guy face this a well
