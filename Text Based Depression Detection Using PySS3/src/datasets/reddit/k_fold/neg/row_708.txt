do you guy also have the unbearable urge to just step out of your door one day and leave i can t take it anymore i tried for year to get happy or at least not miserable but all i do creates more critic and now i m not even at peace when i m home i have no hope finding peace success or even stability at home and just vanishing seems to be the only thing left to try sometimes i just wan na get in my car fuel it up and leave everyone and everything behind sleeping in the car and go wherever sadly i wouldn t even have the money to even last a month
