being gay is so fucking lonely everyone is either busy making their crotch gobblins or busy with their so i come from a super religious family and am not financially stable by myself so i just have to sit on the corner alone and watch everyone else enjoy life i have no one to talk to i dont have any friend id feel comfortable talking about this with and warmlines feel fake a fuck i hate how straight men treat every get together a an excuse to find someone to fuck but i also feel lile a fucking weirdo for not liking woman in latin america where im from people think gay men want to be woman and every comedy show make fun of u i just feel like an object not a human an effigy created to be ridiculed and ostracized a thing that help straight people feel better about themselves by being a freak a useful object like a gay best friend or le of a man i know this will sound petty but it also hurt seeing so many beautiful men and knowing that i would never be able to be with them im also pretty ugly and gay men tend to be quite vain im not muscular im too hairy to be a femboy or a twink and im not a bottom like most people would expect of me i just feel like i dont fit in anywhere and no one will love me
