my girlfriend finally left me my depression drove our relationship into ruin it also drove my relationship with my family into the ground i feel so hopeless i feel so much sorrow and so much rage toward myself i m not emotionally stable one negative thing can put my mental state so deep in the negative i don t know what to do anymore but killing myself i feel tired all the time i try to work for something but then i fail and can t pick it back up cause of my exhaustion why is it so painful watching the people you love leave knowing you can t blame anyone but yourself and they think i m not trying hard enough or i dont care about them i just can t win the battle in my head with my depression and my anxiety i wa never religious but i started praying for god lately to end my life please i just want to go and rest i just want to be at peace
