hi guy it s late night now here in my time zone i can t shake down the urge to go to the building rooftop and take a leap it s story tall should i do it please tell me a logically sensible suggestion my reason my family got covid 9 the past month but it affected my otherwise healthy 0 year old dad the most within a couple of week of infection including 0 day isolated hospital confinement thing just kept getting worse so he wa moved to another hospital for icu confinement and there went into lung failure doctor decided on intubation thing didn t stop there and currently he is on ecmo in a different hospital it s been about month and he is yet to show any progress i work and used to live alone but recently we all have been together from my fam s side my dad is the only breadwinner and he controlled their finance so naturally i took the heat during his absence a a stopgap running his business for a couple of month paying bill and medical expense food etc i have burnt through all my personal saving sold my cryptos and taken all the possible loan just to stay afloat with the expense this ha made me terribly depressed and made me unable to continue working since last week by the end of this month i can t even pay my dad s insurance premium in that case the policy is gon na lapse because of month of non payment i don t see a way out of this i need about 0k just to cover the due and maybe another 0k for the future expense at this point i can t get out or stop this snowball effect my mom isn t willing to work nor doe she have the experience to work any decent job my si just finished her high school but is trying for a job anyway even if we all work in this place we can t possibly make a dent in the due and expense all of this is taking my self control off i feel like i ll snap and go insane any moment but i and my dad have life insurance policy my dad s policy is just gon na pay 00k if ever on the other hand my head can pay out a quarter million dollar claim it can solve all the problem and save their life i can also get this miserable life to stop hurting me any further i like to think logically philosophically and pragmatically i don t see a better option than this should i do it tldr my healthy 0 year old dad got covid 9 went into lung failure and is currently on maximum life support on ecmo i ve bankrupted myself supporting my fam and am still in need of about 0k or more to settle the due and for further expense i m at the verge of insanity from all the pressure i ve a life insurance worth 0k should i do the deed and let my fam claim the benefit so that they can solve everything and live better life sorry for any bad english thanks in advance
