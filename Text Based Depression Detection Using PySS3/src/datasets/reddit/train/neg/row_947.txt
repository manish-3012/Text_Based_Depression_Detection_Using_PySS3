i m just wondering if anyone ha experienced people in healthcare disbelieving how depressed you are because you have a job i hold a very low level easy work from home job i m sure if i wasn t depressed i d be able to do a much higher level job but my current job is not demanding at all and honestly there are day when i cry for the entire day however i ve had psychiatrist downplay how depressed i am because i have a job at all i wish i didn t have to work but i d become homeless pretty quickly so it s not like i really have a choice i just find it frustrating because some of these doctor aren t prioritizing getting me access to the help i need because of their bias ha anyone else had this kind of experience
