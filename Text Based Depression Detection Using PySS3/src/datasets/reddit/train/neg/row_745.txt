through out the day i keep telling myself okay tomorrow you need wake up and do these thing so i have to go to sleep early job search and practice permit test to get the license but every night once it reach 9 0 i find myself unhappy in my bed ruminating about how i messed up in life and how worthless i am that no one want to hire me i wonder is it even worth it i then end up sleeping till like or am i ve applied to food le and such and have gotten either no call or few place rejecting me i stay up in bed trying to find something that ll distract me or pacify me to sleep and even when i do go to sleep early i dread waking up i just wish i could sleep forever
