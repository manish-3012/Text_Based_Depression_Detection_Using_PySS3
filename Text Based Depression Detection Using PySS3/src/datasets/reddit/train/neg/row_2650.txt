just a disclaimer but i love my parent and i love my family a lot i ve been super spoiled when i wa younger and i m glad i wa born in my family in no way is this vent ragging on them or supposed to highlight them a bad people idk what the main topic of this is just a vent bc i got my card like a week ago and i feel horrible i m planning on offing myself before the next school year start im planning on doing everything ive wanted and never done before then go out with a bang be useful for once in my life then leave while the satisfaction is still fresh and before i make another mistake truthfully in the past two year i ve tried multiple time but stopped at the very last second i m not struggling a bad a everyone else so why do i feel so miserable everyone else ha become better now so why not me i ve just gotten lazier and lazier and basically just lost all of my will to do anything right now i m a a child i wa pretty much one of those kid who were constantly pressured to be in first place join competition win in basically anything many time i wa pressured to do thing i didn t want and hand in hand with that i couldn t really do most of the thing i liked too an example of the thing i had to do wa public speaking and basically announcing stuff in front of a crowd i already had stage fright then but it ended up getting worse and became overall anxiety after i humiliated myself multiple time on stage forgetting what to say stuttering etc i knew many people who could do it better but no matter how much i disliked it i guess i had no choice after that my voice became quieter i became passive i didn t raise my hand unless i wa called everytime i wa in front of people i basically just shut down when i wa younger i wa a lot more extroverted the older i became the smaller my confidence fell when i reached th grade i became really paranoid and felt all my worth wa tied to being smart and even now i still can t break away from thinking that way basically my self esteem is now in the gutter maybe even in hell at this point but the difference is just that i don t really care anymore i constantly felt the need to be a role model felt that enjoying thing would make me le of one while the rest of my class bonded with each other went on outing etc i wa so stuck up that i never went with them i wa very rule abiding after all that wa the only thing i ve ever known i remember the first time i got second place my mom is a super nice person to be honest but that time she told me i wasn t trying hard enough really hurt me so much i also used to be a really moody child there wa a time i overhead my mom say that it would be my fault if she died from stress it proved even more to me that my only redeeming factor wa that my grade were high i had the personality of a dog turd i had no talent i wasnt social honestly i wa bad kid there s really no excuse i never got violent with people in fact my sibling were the one who bullied and teased me in a very mild way though just temper tantrum i just wish they sent me to therapy instead of constantly insulting me i didn t even know how to get better i didn t know how to control myself from being angry how could a year old understand that sort of thing i asked them how i could make it stop they told me to just stop being mad i don t know why it affected me so badly now but i feel like the stuff i subconciously learned back then i can t really unlearn that easy anymore even if i don t believe in them anymore i realize i ve never really had dream i wa just going to do what my mom wanted me to do i d get a job be rich and just work and exist i guess deep inside i knew i d never be good enough for that sort of thing i just engrained it in myself that im just an average person maybe even lower and that whenever someone say im smart theyre just giving me empty praise i wouldn t say that the thing that happened to me were extreme not at all but now here i am zero motivation to do anything at all useless and more of a burden than ever before i ve been failing for two year i can t keep up with anyone i don t understand the basic i m always distracted it been two year i still can t do a damn thing the only thing i can do is draw even then it take so much of my time that i can barely do it i have so many thing i want do and learn now but i guess school is in my way again this time i suck at it even harder im always distracted i cant muster any strength or will to study or answer question to make it worse i may have adhd but i dont want to self dx it just that since day people have constantly pointed out my carelessness my voice with an uncontrollable volume etc i cant wake up on alarm i cant follow routine i cant follow timer im really forgetful im distracted and i dont know how to make it stop it horrible i dont know if im just being lazy and trying to excuse it i dont know everytime my mom see my report card i can feel her disappointment i m scared of even looking at her face i dont know why shes trying so hard to keep me alive my parent fought because of me before my mom is already too tired i dont want her to waste any more of her energy on me there just no point before the pandemic i wa still functioning properly hell i even got into the honor list and there were only a few of u now i pas everything late play game all day and slack off incompletes failing grade all of that the first time i remember wanting to pas away to say the least wa when i wa in first grade it wa a weird memory i dont know what prompted me but i gave a paper to my friend and asked her if she d ever thought of dying i remember thinking id never grow past 0 when i wa younger it wa weird but i could never imagine myself a an adult maybe this wa why i thought it wa just that i d pas away because of bad health or some accident i never really cared ive been a burden since day one guess i still am i dont know why i wrote this i guess i just felt horrible thanks for reading i appreciate it sorry for the messiness i wrote along a i thought stuff
