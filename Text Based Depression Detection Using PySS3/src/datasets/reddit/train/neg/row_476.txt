i don t think i m being irrational i know that nobody will ever want to be with me romantically im getting more depressed by the day and i already notice my few friend distancing themselves i can t blame them i m sure i m not fun to be around there s very few people with whom i feel like i can share how i m really feeling but doing so just push them away i need my life to be different not to be stuck in this worthless body i need optimism but there s none left in me i don t think i ll ever be able to kill myself so it s just going to be 0 0 0 maybe even 0 or 0 more year of this void maybe i ll be struck by lightning or something finger crossed
