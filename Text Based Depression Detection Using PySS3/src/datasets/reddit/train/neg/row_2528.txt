tw sui attempt mention of method invalidation take care of yourself before reading i m really really confused because i keep really really invalidating all the time i wanted to die i don t want to call them attempt because they aren t serious i took redacted amount but not a lot of zoloft the first time which is not enough to kill anyone i didn t know that but i wanted to die so that s the closest i think i ve ever gotten to a real attempt but i feel like it s more of an od than an attempt and i m just calling it an attempt based of my ni vete at the time the other two were the same night so i don t even know if i should classify them a separate or not the first the rope wa way too long and the second i didn t tie it correctly and it slipped i didn t try after that but like i never even got a little choked can i even call those attempt i wanted to die but wasn t in any danger these were all year ago and i ve had some therapist say they were attempt but i don t really believe that i wasn t close to dying like my intention i m so ashamed to even call them attempt because they seem so pitiful this past december i feel confident calling my cut a suicidal gesture because if i wasn t chicken i would have gone deeper into the artery i still needed stitch though because i wanted to die but knew that i wouldn t go deep enough so that s not even a true attempt either everyone else i talk to in my life with attempt is like yeah i attempted x amount of time and almost died and had to be in the hospital and i m sitting over here thinking how fucked up is it that i m calling my pitiful gesture attempt when they haven t even come close to having negative consequence it doesn t seem right to me am i just calling them attempt for attention because i want to make people think it wa more severe then it actually wa
