i ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thought for a couple of year now i don t know why but i also have the worst anxiety and it cause me to overthink everything and ruin my own life anytime i m near a stranger i can only think about if i m breathing too loud or weird and when people look at me i just want to disappear because i m afraid their laughing at me or something i cry a lot and i feel bad because dude aren t supposed to cry so much i hate work too i work at home depot and i feel like every person think i m weird and is laughing at me for something i just want to make my family proud and be successful but i have such terrible intrusive thought and i hate it i ve also never really had a real girlfriend i dated in middle school and i feel like the biggest loser because of it i just don t understand why we live our life knowing we re gon na die anyways even if your the richest man your still gon na die the best looking or most healthy person is still gon na die so what s the point
