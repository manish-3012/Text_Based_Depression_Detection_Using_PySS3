it been year 0 month and 9 day since i last self harmed i m really trying to keep the streak going but honestly i don t know if i can make it much longer i ve been thinking of suicide heavily the past few day and i m just so tired every aspect of my life all seemed to crash and burn within the same couple day and i m so tired of cry and hurting i just feel numb but at the same time i feel so much something that i have to scream i ve been trying to be better about being positive or telling myself to keep going but is it really worth it i spent all of last night thinking about killing myself and really what would happen i hope you all have a better day tomorrow
