trigger warning self harm hello i m a 0 year old male and have bipolar i i wa recently diagnosed but knew for year i wa bipolar i just never had the courage to actually seek help due to the stigma i ve been on one medication already lamictal that back fired on me and i m hesitant but desperate to go on something else to help with the severe depression and suicidal ideation i ve never had thought of self harming but last night i started to and it s only intensifing i scratched my arm raw earlier and i hate to even say that i m ashamed i fear i ll use a sharp object next and that scare me most of all because i don t trust myself to stop once i start i need someone to talk to i have no friend and my life is pure hell
