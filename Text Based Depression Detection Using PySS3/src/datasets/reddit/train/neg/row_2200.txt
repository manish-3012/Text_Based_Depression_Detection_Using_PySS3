every little thing i do every step i take i regret it after i think too much about how what i do will affect others to the point where i just want to fade away and not exist i can t get over my failure a long a i have a constant reminder of them it s impossible and i can t bear it anymore i wish thing didn t happen like this i wish thing didn t continue like this i just want thing to improve but there s no sign nothing i feel so done
