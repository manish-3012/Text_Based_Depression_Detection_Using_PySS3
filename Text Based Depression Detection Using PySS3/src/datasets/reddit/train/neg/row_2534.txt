for a long a i can remember i ve always just felt inferior i m not good at anything i m not attractive i m not rich i don t have any unique talent or ability i literally just exist to let people down i always thought that a i got older i d slowly figure it all out but it hasn t gotten better and it never will i deserve to die for being a burden to everyone in my life
