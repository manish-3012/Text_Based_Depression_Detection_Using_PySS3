no clue where to put this so it s going here a while back i wa asked what caused you to start drinking so heavily my default respond to that ha always been it s just how i am which for the most part is correct deep down i think i always knew the real answer now i am finally realizing it s truth it s love a little more context i have been sober for over year now and to be honest recently it ha really been tested and i ve come closer than i ever have to relapsing it is worth mentioning i m not the type of person to actively seek a romantic relationship i have had a few very brief fling over the year but nothing i would consider serious and for the most part i have been okay with it but now i have actually caught real feeling for someone and i am falling hard so hard it s really scaring me it s causing me to want to hide from the feeling a i used too by drinking after year of counseling i wa given better tool to help process certain feeling that could lead to me drinking which i do believe they have helped me recently because i actually did something i didn t think i wa capable of i told her how i felt too my surprise she actually didn t tell me no but she didn t exactly say yes either which is why i am feeling the way i am now i believe now i feel like i m on a rollercoaster of high and low i see her and talk to her daily a we do work together however some day she seems so distant and shut off others it seems to me she s overly flirty we have gone out once it didn t really go a planned but it wa still nice now to the stuff that is really eating at me she had just gotten out of a relationship a while back i know it didn t end well and when i told her how i felt she said she still wa trying to get over her ex and she wa confused which is understandable and i want to give her time and space but at the same time i don t want to miss my chance especially because i have not felt this way about anyone for over 0 year to make thing worse her ex is also a coworker in our department and i have seen them leaving together after work multiple time a week which to be fair is really her business but if she really would rather be with him why don t she tell me that s what s killing me i feel like she is using me a a fallback or a second choice i really hope it s not the case i do not think i could handle it i just wish i knew for sure how she felt i can handle being rejected it the limbo i feel like i m in i can t handle and honestly i don t know what to do about it i m so scared i m going to slip one day and have a drink if that happens i know i won t recover from it and i ll loose everything i worked so hard to achieve there s more detail if anyone ha any question if anyone can tell me what i should do please feel free anything is better than how i feel now
