i literally feel empty and hollow i feel like i m slowly just losing touch of what it mean to be alive i had people to talk with for awhile and it wa great it made me smile knowing i wasn t lonely anymore but look like that disappeared from me the one i talk to just stopped no concern no care just treated a a stranger that really broke my heart i feel so sad and unmotivated about anything anymore it such bad timing because i figured what i wanted to do in life and this come to weigh me down i literally feel like ending it would give me a sense of peace for once i don t know what to do so much stress is on me i don t know how to deal with it anymore what am i supposed to do now
