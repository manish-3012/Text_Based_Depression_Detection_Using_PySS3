well the title say it all i ve decided to off myself after thursday im not sure how i m going to do it but i m tired of fighting for my life my in law kicked me out and i have to leave on or before the th of april i have no one and no where to go my husband refuse to get an apartment with me because he s not ready i have nothing good to look forward to and i know a soon a i move out he s probably gon na file for divorce so wtf is the point of being heartbroken and alone i m scared death is gon na hurt but it s what i have to do of course i m scared shitless but not being in pain anymore is better than surviving the worst
