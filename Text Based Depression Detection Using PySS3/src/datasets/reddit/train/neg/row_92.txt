literally a im typing this im sat with my friend just feeling sorry for myself i said i would do something with them a i wanted to but when i actually started talking to them i felt like complete shit i havent said a word in about 0 min and it almost like there just this weird dead air 00 they can hear me typing this and know that it just me being quiet and not any other factor i hate myself in the sense that i agreed to do this but i just feel like a dick for not inputting anything they dont even really know that anything is going on because im too afraid to tell them too much so i just have this horrible feeling that they are starting to hate me and want to make me go away so they can actually enjoy themselves i think the worst part is is that i dont even blame them im really just not fun to be around anymore a i dont find anything overly enjoyable anymore i apologise if my punctuation or my spelling or whatever is off i just felt like i really needed to say something
