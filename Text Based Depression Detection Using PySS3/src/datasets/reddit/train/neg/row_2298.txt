got my loan i m officially 90k in debt now i can t die with a clean conscience dying would put all that debt on my wife i mean i have life insurance and if it happens to be an accident i think it double so financially she should be fine assuming i don t get fired first but now my mood is just shitty before i wa okay with dying now i feel just a much a burden alive than i do dead i wrote this before but there is a certain freedom in coming to term with death a calm malaise that feel good like everything and everyone doesn t matter
