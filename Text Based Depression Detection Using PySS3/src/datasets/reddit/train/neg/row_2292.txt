i ve been wanting to kill myself for a while but i tried to be strong and i kept fighting it i kept looking for a calling something to give my life meaning and everytime i think i got it it s just ripped away and i m slapped by reality i m tired of it the longer i stay alive the more i just drain the energy from the people i love killing myself would hurt them emotionally for sure but logically it be the best thing for them no more worrying about the loser
