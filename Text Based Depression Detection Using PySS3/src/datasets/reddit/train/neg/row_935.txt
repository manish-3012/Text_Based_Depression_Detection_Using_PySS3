tw sh suicide i m a year old still in high school with depression anxiety intrusive thought and a emerging personality disorder i got diagnosed year ago now and once i heard that it wa overwhelming it made me feel labelled a a kid who wa no longer a kid but a mentally ill person and it wa horrible it put me in the worst place of my life and after service and service all spoke to me the most important thing i realised is that i m never going to be the same person before i wa diagnosed and i had to accept the fact i m not okay that wa the first step into recovery and year in im finally starting to get better bit by bit iknow how hard menial task can be such a getting out of bed showering eating etc which is why i m glad so many people know how hard it is to having people who understand is another key thing that helped me start to recover a a lot of other people suffering from depression i self harmed and i self harmed for a year and a half it became almost an addiction and for the first time since i started i can finally say i no longer want to do it i m currently day sober from a relapse after month sober relapsing is a part of recovery which is a thing i m still learning because when you relapse you don t think this is natural your first thought it oh ffs all that progress i made is gone but intact it s not it s just a part of it i also suffer from suicidal tendency meaning that i have constant suicidal thought and i have attempted time it sound bad and it is but i m glad i did because it made me realise how much i want to live the last one wa the worst one my mum found me hanging in my room and cut me down and instead of going ballistic she listened to me and got me the help i needed now me and my whole family are closer than ever so a horrible situation worked out the best i decided to write this to let people read if they want to and know that no matter how bad you are at that point there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel cliche but true and make sure you don t lose track of the most important instinct survival thank you for reading it mean a lot
