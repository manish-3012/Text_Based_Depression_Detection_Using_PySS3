i have no trauma or especially horrible experience it took me yr to even admit to myself that i m most likely depressed i thought that i would write down my feeling but my mind resonated that to writing a suicide not i m proud of myself for stopping when i realised that it made me feel worse i feel lonely i have friend who i trust care for and can talk to yet it s impossible for me to tell them about any of my true feeling because even i cant understand what s going on in my head i feel guilty for thinking that one of the main reason for my behaviour is my family they have always emotionally neglected me treated me a the dumb kid invalidated any feeling i expressed and my mother is physically and verbally abusive i barely share thing with them and nowadays they ve started scolding me for telling them anything because apparently i m too pessimistic my sister seems to be using me i have always been there for her and listened to her when she needed while she is there for me if i need help with study and shit she never even make an attempt to listen to me because apparently that s a therapist duty and she isn t my therapist i can t cry i can barely feel thing at this point i m like a zombie my mental state usually deteriorates in the summer and summer is here i can sense the decline my only friend who i can physically meet and am comfortable sharing deeper detail about myself to seems to understandably freak out when it come to suicide related topic if it involves known example basically joke and stuff are fine but he seems to get a bit perplexed if i mildly hint at my suicidal nature this is just a rant i have a terrible tendency to bottle thing up in such a way that i forget about it i will probably feel better by the end of this day
