i wont do anything because i fear hell but still i cant really explain anything about what i feel think or who i am since a kid ive felt like everything is a fever dream where im being carried by something else that i dont really have control over where i end up where i am at a point in time you ask me the type of question that relate to the my idea of myself and i lose myself and paradoxical thought and incoherent idea i feel sad happy suicidal overly optimistic manic confident in different point in time like random due to this tortured psyche i tend not to know why why is the biggest description of my life i dont why im writing this i dont know if i want a solution for this i dont why i want to know why those paradox of hope and despair make the idea of just be yourself a death sentence for myself ive pushed many away because of my mind baggage and this regret make me rather troubled i am social mostly from a intense desire to conduct and use all my mind nonsense energy into talking talking to people no biggie but when i start getting close to someone or i start liking them a timed detonation start that i dont know the countdown of eventually i will realease my mind onto them on that point in time the relationship wont be the same some people like me for this the existencial despair of my mind is very funny when you hear it talk some just stop talking to me some want to passionately help me save me from myself to be a mentor recently i have to really control it i dont know to what point im getting too i just forgot half of the thing i wa gon na say eventually what im feeling right now a mental breakdown i think maybe i just feel all the paradox getting into a boiling point will reach a limit usually i start getting into suicidal thought not because i hate the world or necessarily hate myself my life etc is a strong feeling of wanting to go away to a better place to see the beautiful thing of a different world to reset my reality to get out of here to end my mind to end my happiness and my sadness my mind suddenly calm itself the fog suddenly clear like body saying you wont die i am left wondering what wa i even thinking about i just wasted my time amp x 00b then the cycle start again i love circle amp x 00b due to this my mind want to end it own thinking meaning that i tend to seek mental damage note you can see how this is a problem for romantic relationship i mean no one want to deal with a man with deep mind issue im willing to accept that i will live and die mostly alone with no meaningfull or deep friend except my family right now and in the future i will have friend and such allways im not a loner on earth but a loner on my reality
