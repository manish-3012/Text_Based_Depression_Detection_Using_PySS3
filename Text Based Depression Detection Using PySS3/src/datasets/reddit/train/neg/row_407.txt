i hold a lot of pain and trauma in me and i m not good at sharing it with others except for a very select few i have started therapy recently sometimes this pain really take control of me almost put me in a black hole where i can t stop and it take a big toll on me and those closest to me mentally therefore i am hurting the people i love most in my life and the pain only get worse i wish i can stop but i get so deep in this hole for that moment of time and i can t escape it when i realize how awful i have been to everyone else it s too late the damage ha been done they understand my trauma and what i been through but people can only handle so much i don t want to hurt those around me anymore what are the best tip to stop or just improve over time thank you
