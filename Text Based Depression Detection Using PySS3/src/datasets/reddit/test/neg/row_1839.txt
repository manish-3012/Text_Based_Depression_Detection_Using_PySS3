idk if it wa selective mutism or not i never got a diagnosis wasn t even suggested to get tested for it partially bc i don t think people understood how serious and debilitating it wa but i used to have severe anxiety around certain people mainly teacher or subject talking about myself or asking for help were big one for me to the point where i literally couldn t speak like people don t really seem to get it when i say this because it s one thing being shy or nervous to speak for me i know how that feel like if i m just nervous i just feel very uncomfortable this wasn t that when talking about certain subject or talking to certain people i would have this very uncomfortable and sometimes very painful physical symptom where i don t know how else to describe it other than it felt like someone wa stepping on my throat like my throat wa closed shut tight i found it hard to breathe not in a hyperventilating kind of way more like in a i m choking right now please help me way i would start hyperventilating if i wa forced to speak for whatever reason trying to force myself to speak would make me lose air lightheaded and i would start breathing hard trying to take in more air since i wa literally choking on nothing basically or worse i d quickly break into an anxiety attack and start cry if i kept trying to force the problem even harder to breathe i felt faint close to passing out so many time then it wa not even funny i m not looking for a diagnosis i wa just wondering if anyone can relate idk
