for the past month i ve been ill and every er urgent care and pediatrician say that nothing is wrong with me after several trip to my school psychologist because of anxiety i ve deduced that these are probably long covid symptom cool i guess since the monday before last i ve been waking up with headache that don t go away i immediately started getting anxious and started researching my symptom immediately google say it s brain cancer great i m and all i ve been thinking about since this started wa how i m going to die soon they ve checked all the problem area except in my head i want to get an mri but the oncoming medical bill are looming over my head i m also scared of the result on one hand i could have a tumor cancer that might kill me and on the other hand i could be wasting everyone s time my pediatrician suck and will probably just say it s anxiety which is probably the secondary issue not the primary one i m just so tired and so scared i feel like i have no one to talk to and it s consuming my life
