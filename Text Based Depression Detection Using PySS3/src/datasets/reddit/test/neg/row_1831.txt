how do i get past this i don t have panic attack i m diagnosed with bpd and never considered anxiety to be it own issue just a component of my bpd but i think my anxiety independent of bpd need it own attention i m scared to seek help i m scared a therapist who specializes in anxiety will stigmatize me for having bpd and tell me that s just your bpd i m anxious my bos won t give me time off work for therapy i m anxious i ll need anxiety med and it ll impair my function
