two day ago i made a comment to my sil i had forgotten some thing that had happened that week and what i said came across a completely insensitive and thoughtless i have since apologised and they have accepted my apology but there hasn t been minute in the following day where i haven t thought about what i said and what a mistake it wa i feel sick i can barely sleep and the panic attack are every min where i can t breathe and just feel like i m drowning i have doubled my dose of sertraline because i simply can not let go of what i ve said this in turn ha increased the side effect of the sertraline anxiety suck i just want to turn my brain off
