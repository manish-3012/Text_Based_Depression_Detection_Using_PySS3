i have a constant fear that i m going to have cardiac arrest or a fatal arrhythmia i f in good health just got back from the gym and it wa great now i m in my car about to get lunch and bam my anxiety kicked in and my heart started beating soo fast honestly it probs only beating 00bpm and all i can think about is what if i die from a cardiac event i m on beta blocker literally for my anxiety and am in therapy but sometimes these thought happen from time to time and it s frustrating i have no real problem with my heart and it s all in my head but sometimes i just wish it would turn off
