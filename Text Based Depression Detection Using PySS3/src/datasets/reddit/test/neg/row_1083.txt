so i wa just working a completely normal day in fact i felt pretty good i work at a goodwill so it s relatively social but i can handle it cause honestly every person that enters that store is fantastically polite and friendly but for some reason half way through my shift i begin getting light head i assumed it wa my tight hat or my new prescription glass so i took those off and got back to work and for a little bit actually helped but it got worse and worse my hand were shaky and i wa super light headed bless my coworkers cause i mentioned i wasn t feeling great and my manager let me have a break despite not requiring one due to shirt shift one of my coworkers actually spent a dollar to get me a snack and i wa improving i didn t wan na leave these lovely people short staffed a i wa the only product handler closing so i tried getting back on the floor and instantly i wa back in it and again bless my manager cause she suggested it wa fine and i could go home i got in my car and instantly my face felt numb by the time i wa home a relatively short drive my chest wa super numb too im i ve only ever had this feeling once before and i wa wondering if this is what a standard panic attack feel like how do i bring this up with my dad in order to get this figured out sorry if this wa long it actually helped a good bit in getting me relaxed just writing this
