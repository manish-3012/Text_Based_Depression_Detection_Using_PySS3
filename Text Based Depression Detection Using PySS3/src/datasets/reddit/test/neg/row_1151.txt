i m renting a room from a guy that i know from aa i heard from others that he s very odd and clean some even told me not to rent from him but the area i m in is in a housing crisis right now and i needed a place to land we ve had a lot of spat over very minor thing but he blow them up to a huge proportion one thing that i did that wa really bad wa i accidentally left my space heater on while i wa at work i realize that s dangerous and costly but i offered to pay the entire month s electricity which he refused and promised that it would never happen again recently i think he went through my drawer but i can t prove it he got really pissed off that i had a set of silverware in my room and gave me 0 day notice to leave it got pretty heated and i said that i need to contact a lawyer because the thing he s threatening to kick me out over are very minor and are basically personality thing he doesn t like i sleep in too late on my day off he ll go through the trash and confront me about thing he think i shouldn t be eating i sleep with my tv on etc we agreed on a move out date of june 0th but the heat in the house is not dying down i feel very unsafe living here just because i don t know the next thing he s going to blow up over i m also moving to a new city in june and i know that he s not going to give me a good review especially after threatening a lawyer this is a verbal agreement and i pay month to month so i know some apartment don t count that a a real tenant history lease though essentially it s like living with a friend for a couple of month i m so stressed out this is on top of me finishing my ph d and the pressure is insane i ve told my friend more thing that have gone on here and they agree that this guy is ludicrous and unwell what should i do am i truly in the wrong and i m that bad of a roommate i keep the house very clean including the room that i pay for i m serious that i think he go through my stuff
