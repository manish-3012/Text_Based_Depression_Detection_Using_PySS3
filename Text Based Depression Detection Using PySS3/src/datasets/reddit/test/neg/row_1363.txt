every single day at school during my rd period i get very nervous for my th period and my stomach start to ache badly it s like there are gas in my stomach and i get very gassy i think i get nervous because i start thinking about this girl i m very intimidated by but i wouldn t think that it would make me this anxious and then in my rd period i have to go to the washroom to do number two and it s usually diarrhea and that happens every single day in rd period no matter what i do to try to calm myself nothing seems to work i tried breathing pattern but i just get nervous again maybe it s because i eat lunch before rd period but it s every single day that my stomach is aching is it normal to feel this way i don t know if i should do something about it
