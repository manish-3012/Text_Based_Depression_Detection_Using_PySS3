hi everyone it s my first time posting on this forum i m really in a bad spot wondering if my anxiety ruined my situationship and would love to talk it through with someone if anyone could message me i d really appreciate it here s a bit more color on the situation we were good friend started talking in december hooked up beginning of february got into a disagreement the next weekend at a bar because this girl who he had hooked up with previously wa all over him and it made me visibly very uncomfortable we spend the next week talking every day but not seeing each other i definitely try to initiate a few hangout so doe he but le so and it didn t really work i know he s also talking to other girl a well but continues to tell me that he really like me and just want to keep getting to know me better last saturday we hook up he again tell me how much he like me and that he doesnt want to play game thursday i ask him over snapchat if he want to meet up for st paddy and he doesnt answer we end up at the same bar i make a comment saying ohh i thought you said no game just teasing he get upset and think i m trying to have a feeling talk with him at a bar while he s drunk we flush it out over text the next day and i ask him if he want to hang out this weekend he say we ll see and that he ha some plan already we end up bumping into each other again on saturday this time we talk the whole afternoon but i can tell he s le flirty more withdrawn he s going to a concert so he leaf i tell him later we re all going out to this bar he like and he heart the message this morning i snap him and ask how the concert wa no response obviously i need to leave this man alone at least for a little bit but i feel like back the first time we hooked up he wa so so into me then i ruined it by being jealous at the bar and by continuing to only pursue him i got complete tunnel vision i should have just left him alone and maybe he would have come to me but now i ve put so much pressure on the situation it doesn t help that my roommate who is his friend tell me constantly how much he doesn t actually like me and that he s just a player
