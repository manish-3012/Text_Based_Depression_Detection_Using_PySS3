so earlier i wa on a run and some kid were playing football behind me one of them accidentally kicked the ball in my direction i could hear him getting closer behind me and i had a sort of intrusive worry that he might kick the ball at me or something a soon a i stopped worrying about it i realised how irrational it wa but i then started to worry that it wa seemingly a paranoid thought and could be a sign of my mental health getting worse can anyone relate to thought similar to this
