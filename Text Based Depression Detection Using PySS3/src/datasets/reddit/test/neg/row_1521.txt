i am male and getting my dream education right now and will be working with young people that can t live with their parent for a multitude of reason anymore in year after year of being aimless i found that to be my dream job i am together with a nice girl and we have great chemistry i am living in my own flat and my grade and praxis are is going great i got professional help after a major mental breakdown i had year ago that made me live like a plant and got over severe depression and constant panic attack panic attack are rare and i know my trigger and how to deal with them i am confident in myself and got to reflect on my messed up childhood and problematic personality trait a couple of week ago i started feeling really anxious tho by far more than usual i am afraid of dying for stupid bodily reason and i am always so tense and have ache in my stomach and neck and my heart beat really fast from time to time and i am afraid my girlfriend will leave me that s what i am most anxious about she is really good for me and she told me that i am good for her but lately she act distant while still showing me affection in way because she isn t doing that good aswell there are reason for her to feel bad besides me but i am afraid that i might be a big reason because she wa confronted with a lot of my anxiety related issue logically i would say she won t leave me because gave me thoughtful present and still care for me by reminding me to eat and she sometimes say she miss me but she behaves so distant and it s triggering me so hard because of a toxic relationship i wa in i decided not to talk about my anxiety anymore because i don t want to lay that upon her and i told her about my abandonment issue once and will leave it at that because i don t want her to feel bad everytime she behaves distant because of her own issue that would be selfish hell she even told me she won t stop loving me even if she cant express it but my anxiety is still there the worst thing is that she doesn t want to speak about what s bothering her because she doesn t want to think about it which make me feel like it s me and then i feel like an asshole because i am not the center of the world so yeah long story short my abandonment issue are the worst thing right now i decided not to bother her with it because it s not fair but i don t know how to deal with it oh and those issue wouldn t be so bad if i weren t so anxious in general the general anxiety came with the practical part of my education but i don t know why because i am doing good i will be done with that in week and that s when i will meet her again and i hope that everything will be okay by then but i am afraid that i will be sabotaging myself before then by ruining my relationship just so that the anxiety go away
