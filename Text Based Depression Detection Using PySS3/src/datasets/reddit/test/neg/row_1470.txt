i ve been on venlafaxine for year or so it helped at first but it hasn t helped whatsoever in quite some time i take 0mg in the morning the last month my anxiety and panic ha been absolutely crippling debilitating and unbearable i called the dr today and he called in a prescription to increase me from 0mg to mg i hate taking any medication or pill whatsoever especially increasing a dosage anyone had any good result from a venlafaxine increase after taking the same dosage for such a long time
