i am a waitress in a busy restaurant and while usually i put my mask on and try to not seem so anxious for some reason lately my anxiety is getting to the point where i can t even look at people in the face and then my anxiety just get worse thinking about how much of a bitch or weirdo i seem for not looking at them i also struggle with eye contact which make it even harder i honestly just want to ease my mind and be able to talk to people like the rest of my co worker i m contemplating medication but wanted to know if anybody noticed a difference while on medication
