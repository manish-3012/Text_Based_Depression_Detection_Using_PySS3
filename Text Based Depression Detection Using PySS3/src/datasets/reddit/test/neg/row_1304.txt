so i got my mirena removed last month on the th because of it having a bad effect on my mental health i had it in for a little over year i knew getting it out id probably experience the mirena crash i wa fine up until today when i got my first period i ve had very intense anxiety depression all day today to the point where i can t even leave my house i m guessing it s the shift in hormone and everything considering it s been 0 year since i ve been birth control free did anyone else experience this super low mood after removal i ve also just been feeling very out of body today and very exhausted
