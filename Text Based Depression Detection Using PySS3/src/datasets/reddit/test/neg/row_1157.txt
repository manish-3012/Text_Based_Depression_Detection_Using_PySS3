trigger warning racism do you know these situation where you react insecure and passive although you feel extremely uncomfortable year ago i wa out with a group of people one wa a friend of mine and a few of them were more or le acquaintance so there wa this guy who got drunk and he started making black joke i am mixed race half german and half afro american he became really offensive and insulting he said stuff like oh i m going to say it in your language and then he did those click sound which are common in african khoisan language he wa trying to act like oh i m just joking don t take me serious but he wouldn t stop i felt so uncomfortable and i wa really angry but i wa also insecure i wa giggling nervously and just wanted to change the topic but he kept making stupid joke about me in the end i paid my drink and went home but i acted like everything wa fine it s been year and i can t stop thinking about it i keep overthinking of how i should have reacted and i feel so ashamed of myself whenever i remember this situation tbh what disappointed me the most wa that nobody really said anything someone at the table just said oh just ignore him he s an idiot and they laughed a few day later someone told me that everyone felt really uncomfortable yet no one said anything i feel like it s difficult for me to let this go and it took me a almost year to realize how bad this situation actually wa maybe someone can relate or made a similar experience
