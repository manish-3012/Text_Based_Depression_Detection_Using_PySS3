i ve finally been put on med after year of pushing through my anxiety the idea of going on med wa scary but i m hoping it ll be better in the long run the only issue i m having so far is i m so tired i m normally not this tired but i swear all weekend i ve just been sleeping i have no motivation to do anything i just want to sleep i m hoping that this will go away a my body adjusts more a part of me is scared that the drowsiness won t go away i m happy that i have this week off from work to try to get myself used to them before going back to work i don t want to be tired like this forever
