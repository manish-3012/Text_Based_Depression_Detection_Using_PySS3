for reference i am f graduating college in may i grew up in a really shitty town and i worked really hard in school to guarantee i could get into my dream college and move to a city where i thought i would find more likeminded people college sincerely sucked i had terrible friend now don t really have friend don t really like my major scared that i only have qualification for a job i won t like and not to mention half of college wa online because of covid i am so terrified of applying for job and figuring out what i want to do with my life this wa literally my biggest fear going into school wa that i would waste year on a degree i don t love and don t know what i want to do i feel like applying to job is also accepting that i am no longer a student which ha been a huge part of my identity for what year i also think having college be a huge disappointment make me really nervous for everything else like the narrative that high school and college are supposed to be the best year of your life is pushed so much and both really weren t great i ve also heard it really hard to make friend outside of school which scare me a lot i feel like i have a few friend that i talk to occasionally but i don t think of them a my best friend or that i am overly close with them i think i am a nice and interesting person who care about others a lot and i don t understand why i have had such a long history of really horrible friend who never really cared about me literally had my best friend in high school pick the guy who sexually assaulted me over me i just am so scared that life won t get better it seems so easy for other people and i don t understand why figuring out life ha been so difficult for me
