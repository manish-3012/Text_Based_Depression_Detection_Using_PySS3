even when i have logical proof that it isn t true i still can t help thinking everyone find me annoying and hate me one example of this is a guy that work in the reception of my accommodation we get along well we talk more often than we would need to and often about thing that aren t customer employee related he ll asks me question about my family and my life when he doesn t need to in reality the only interaction we need to have is me collecting parcel or if i have problem with the accommodation so clearly all other conversation is optional and he wouldn t talk to me if he didn t want to yet i still can t help but think he hate talking to me and would rather i just leave him alone and yes there is the possibility that he s just putting up with me for those few minute but even then i know this probably isn t true a he suggested i apply for student ambassador next year and he wouldn t do that if he couldn t truly stand me because the role involves working with him for multiple hour so why despite these solid fact do i think he can t stand me and how do i stop thinking like this
