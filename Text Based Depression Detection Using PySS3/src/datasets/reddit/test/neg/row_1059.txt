nowadays it s a if my body is just tired of being anxious all the time like it doesn t really care anymore like it s just an annoying pest i get intrusive thought which fuel my anxiety and my neurosis it seems that after dealing with it all for so long the constant worrying the obsessing the hyper fixation the pacing back amp forth the chest pain and the dizziness the shallow breathing i m just tired of it so tired of fighting my mind and body is basically starting to tell itself man what are you even toiling over what s the point why worry about what s not there what you can t control it s one thing when others say that kind of stuff to you but when you realize it yourself it hit different somehow i m starting to actually feel some relief for the first time in a long time this is an interesting development in how i feel towards my mental health i guess it s some kind of progress though not the ideal way to overcome the anxiety it s better than nothing i m sure i m not out of the wood yet but hey i ll take it i want my life back i don t know if anyone else ha made this realization too i m just kind of venting keep your head up everyone stay safe out there
