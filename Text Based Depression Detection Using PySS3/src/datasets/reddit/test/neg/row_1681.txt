i know i m not i m fully aware that i m not dying the problem is the fact that it feel extremely difficult to breathe even though i know nothing is wrong my lung are genuinely taking in all the air that they can and i don t have any medical issue there s no pressure around my rib yet i feel trapped i feel like i m running out of breath and it s making me panic and that in itself is making it even harder to breathe i feel on the verge of a panic attack even my posture is fine ha anyone else felt this weird out of breath sensation it feel like no matter how much air i take in it s not enough
