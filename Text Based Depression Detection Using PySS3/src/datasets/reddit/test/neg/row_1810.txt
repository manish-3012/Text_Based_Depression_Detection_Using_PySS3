should i ask my parent for a therapy session i m scared to ask my parent for therapy and i come seeking opinion on what i should do i m y o and these feeling have been killing me i m sure change in hormone have a part in this but i have been dealing with feeling of poor self worth since i wa i begin slightly shaking clinging and breathing heavily with excessive worry and fear almost daily now but i m worried my parent will say average teenage feeling and leave it at that i also don t want to waste money on something that might be just a phase and so i m asking for thought on this matter now for a little backstory my writing may be a little messy so i apologize in advance thinking back i ve had symptom of anxiety for a while now i wa yelled at a lot a a child for very trivial matter and still to this day ill get hour long lecture for thing that arent that big of a deal after a specific scolding when i wa around i believe that kickstarted thing i started playing what i saw and heard in my mind over and over again until i got night terror for some reason i can still recall this moment and it still scare me i became afraid of a certain speed like m p h a strange thing to be afraid of i know don t know if this is just some sort of trauma type thing or what but it wa always weird to me i start sweating and shaking whenever i think about anything with that specific speed and i don t know what that mean anyways fast forward to early 0 9 and my grandma passed away she wa the only one i truly felt attached to and trusted i have trust issue don t know why so her passing hit me hard a year later when covid started my dad cheated with my best friend s mom ending in a lot of self confidence issue and when my trust issue began showing my parent are still together they just argued and eventually got it worked out since i don t want everything to go downhill again i just bottled up everything and hid what i felt now to the present day this is why i find it so difficult to ask for a therapist i m afraid that my parent will just brush it off or be disappointed and think they did something wrong this hopefully doesn t give the wrong idea about my parent i believe they tried their best and to be honest didn t do a horrible job there were still good time i remember and they ve done a lot for me unfortunately i can t truly say i love you back without my parent telling me and that hurt i know people have it much worse than me and that s another reason that s holding me back from asking either way i m still heavily considering therapy and why i m asking you is it just a phase will i benefit from a professional am i being petty and should just deal with it i m not looking for a diagnosis but would love some thought on the matter and will try my best to answer any question if any thanks p s i hope this wasn t too long i tried to cram a much information a possible without it being accessive apology for any grammar mistake
