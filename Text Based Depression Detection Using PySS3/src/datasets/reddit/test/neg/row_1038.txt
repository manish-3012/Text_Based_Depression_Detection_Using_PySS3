so i ve been working steadily since i wa i m now i ve been dealing with anxiety panic disorder the entire time i used to have it mostly under control enough that it didn t usually affect my work social life etc but it ha gotten really bad i ve been calling in sick a lot i worked a five hour shift yesterday and i wa having a panic attack by the time my gf picked me up i just don t think i m physically or mentally capable of working right now but i have rent to pay and i can t afford to be unemployed so i m wondering if anybody here ha gotten disability assistance for their anxiety panic attack and how i might go about doing that
