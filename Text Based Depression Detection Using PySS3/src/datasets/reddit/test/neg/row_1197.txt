sometimes when i close my eye to try to sleep i get this crazy feeling that i can describe closest to be a zap it only last a second second and kind of feel like a sharp rush upwards and make me whole body tingle a little when it happens i thought it wa vertigo at first but since hearing about brain zap i think this might be closest i also described the feeling to my ent because i thought it wa vertigo and he looked confused taken aback but my description so i m guessing it really isn t vertigo it doesn t happen too often and only really happens at night when i close my eye to sleep i ve never been on any medication
