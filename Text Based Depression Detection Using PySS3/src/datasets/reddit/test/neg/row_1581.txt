since i wa little i have been raised to never respond when i think people are wrong or when they scold me so i learned to just keep it all since i moved alone to another city i have tried to express myself better without being aggressive but lately i have noticed that when i express my emotion or thought people get angry or upset with me so i have been thinking for some time that maybe everyone prefers my submissive version that doe not mention what i think to my most assertive self and that from my perspective it is my true self maybe my personality is wrong and i really should change it or maybe i just don t have the tact to give my opinion advice for any of those option would help me a lot thanks
