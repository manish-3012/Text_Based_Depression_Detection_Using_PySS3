hi i 9f just applied to become the disability rep for one of the society at my uni this is kind of a big deal for me since i ve never really interacted outside of the bubble of maybe 0 people in total of my year and did not visit any of the society meetups but with the way the application are looking they re letting just about anyone in several people who happen to be my friend are also applying for other position and i know it might just be our little bubble but i am so very proud of myself for doing something i have never done before i got diagnosed with anxiety and depression just very recently and i had to take the rest of the year off from uni so yeah this is a big thing for me omg
