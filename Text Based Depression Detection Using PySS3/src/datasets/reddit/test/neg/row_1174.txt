about a year ago i started getting anxious when i heard people yelling it doesn t happen when i m being yelled at only when it s other people arguing or sometimes even just loud talking even if it s isn t fighting it s gotten much worse to the point of me shaking and cry when i hear yelling i don t understand it i don t have much of a past with yelling a far a i know so i m not sure why this could be happening especially so suddenly there isn t much i can do to stop people from yelling because no one listens when i say it make me anxious and my only way to really block it out is loud music which i can t always have but i feel like at least knowing what could be causing this would help me feel at least a bit more normal understood if anyone know what this could be caused by or anything that could ease it even in the slightest bit maybe a form of music or something else please share it with me i d be very grateful also i don t have access to a therapist currently a mine just moved and i didn t get much time to talk to her about it
