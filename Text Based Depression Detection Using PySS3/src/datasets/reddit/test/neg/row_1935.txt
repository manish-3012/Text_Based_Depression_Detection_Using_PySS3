i seriously don t get how people just live their every day life without completely falling apart and i don t get how people are just happy with their life i m in college right now and i m failing class have no friend and zero motivation to do anything about it i really just don t see the point in putting myself through hell for a degree so i can get a job i don t want and coming home from that job to absolutely no one i really don t think anyone could ever love me so if i ll hate my job have no friend and no romantic partner what s the point there s nothing in my life worth working towards and i m ready to give up on everything i just can t do this anymore and i don t know what s left to do other than kill myself
