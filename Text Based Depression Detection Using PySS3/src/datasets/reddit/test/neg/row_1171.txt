i had struggled with this decision for month and finally i did it today i think i had been thinking a lot about how to say it and what my bos would say and i didn t even think about how i would feel after doing it maybe bc deep down i kinda knew i wa postponing it for a long time kinda surprised myself today when i did it the thing is i m just really weirded out bc i know it s the best for me and my bos even said so that there s in fact no room for growth there but i think my discomfort come from a deep attachment to this routine i ve had for almost year even if it wasn t the best and not knowing what s gon na happen with my job life from now on bc i don t have a new one yet amp x 00b anyway don t wan na let my anxiety win and revolve around this weird feeling bc i think i should be proud of myself for taking the matter into my own hand for once and for all amp x 00b if you read this hi and ty
