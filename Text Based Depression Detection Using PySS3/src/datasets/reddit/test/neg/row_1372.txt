i ve been feeling a lot and going through a lot for the past few week i can t talk to anyone i m emotionally and mentally drained i m not even diagnosed with anything but i feel like i m having anxiety and just want to be done with everything i sometimes feel like i just want to jump off our building or drown myself in the pool so that i wouldn t feel anything i m really scared i know what happened to me wa careless and full of stupidity i guess this is my karma just letting out a little bit i don t know who else to talk to i feel like i m dying inside i m afraid to go to the beach with my friend because i might do something really stupid i ve been cry and cry every night so that i could hide all my feeling but it s really killing me i want to get out of this situation but i can t escape i know i have to help myself but i can t do it there s no one else to blame but me i m so sorry for this i just have no one to talk to i don t want to be a burden to the people around me
