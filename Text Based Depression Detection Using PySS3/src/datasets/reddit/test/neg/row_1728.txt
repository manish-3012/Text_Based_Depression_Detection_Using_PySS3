i just can t seem to relax throughout the day every time i think about sitting down and reading watching a tv show meditating putting a face mask on etc i ve got 000 thing on my mind random stuff anxious thought thing i have to get done etcetc so i never get to truly relax i panic just thinking about reading cause it ll be calm and there s nothing to distract me from my thought until i m able to focus on the book which can take a while the only time i m able to actively relax is when i m tired after i ve worked out for h in the gym or late at night got ta find the sweet spot between anxious mess and falling asleep feel like walking a tightrope amp even when i manage to get there i have more important stuff to do than relaxing eg studying amp other stuff that my anxious self didn t manage to do
