for example this happened the other day while driving to class the week before first week of the course sometimes i wa pretty nervous agitated and generally anxious during the drive resulting in a weird feeling that i usually feel in this circumstance it s hard to put it to word like an uneasy rushy in real time sense of reality this time i didn t feel any of that i wa actually close to being symptomless the problem is that when i started noticing this too much my brain started to scan and check for that feeling that i described before even tho i didn t eventually feel it again it did ruin the moment and it impacted a bit on the symptom anyway so how can i just let go generally speaking
