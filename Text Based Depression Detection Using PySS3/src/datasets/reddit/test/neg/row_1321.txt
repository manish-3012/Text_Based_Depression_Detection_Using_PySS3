i keep having anxiety in the shower sometimes i can manage through but i had to shave and take a little extra time my usual anxious thought about a million way to die i swear i could have written the script to the movie and why i m terrified of the unkniwn waved over me and i pushed through the shower a fast a i could got out and instantly took a full pill of my clonazepam mg now i m sitting here about minute later still half anxious struggling to even right this a my brain is going into shut down mode i still have to make dinner but my husband may be tasked with it tonight which i know he won t complain or think anything of it but it make me feel like a bad wife i went almost month with little to no anxiety until about week ago and now i feel like i m right back to where i wa it s been two year and i m so ungodly tired of this i m tired of being good for a couple year then being thrown back into anxiety panic attack i m tired of deciding that not feeling at all is better than participating in living c
