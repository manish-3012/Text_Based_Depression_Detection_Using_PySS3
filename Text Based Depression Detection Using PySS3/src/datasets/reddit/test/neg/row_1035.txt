i m always scared of getting dvt but usually tell myself it s not it and move on i do get leg pain from working a desk job and have had leg ultrasound in the last year that were clear i usually tell myself if it s a symptom i ve felt before i m fine just started a work from home job where walk le i get up every hour but walking around the house is very different than a large office building and my leg ha been hurting which isn t new but i happened to look at where it hurt and it s the area right below my knee cap on the inner part of my leg aka the part that could touch the other leg when i m standing i noticed there is slight swelling there idk if swelling is even the right term since it s not hot or red but def stick out more than the other side maybe about half an inch more which is new considering i ve in the past looked for swelling a i mentioned before it s not hot or red but i am worried yet don t want to cry wolf and get a rd ultrasound in the last year i should mention i have an autoimmune disease that can put me at risk for blood clot but thankfully have had no issue prior i don t want to bother my dr again but also don t want this to be the time i actually have it since i ve never seen swelling on my leg before
