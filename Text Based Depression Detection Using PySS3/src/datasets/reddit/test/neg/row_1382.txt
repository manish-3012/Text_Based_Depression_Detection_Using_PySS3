curious to see what people think here s my question can dissociation also be described a separating yourself from thing event happening in your life for example if something happens that overwhelms me or make me really anxious a lot of time i simply forget it i ll be going along with my day a normal but feel that something is off so i ll have to sit for a moment and think why do i feel sad anxious etc and after a minute of thinking back it click oh right i have to give a presentation on thursday is this a form of dissociation it ha always happened to me and if i describe it to someone they usually don t understand it i e if i m anxious i can t stop thinking about whatever it s about let alone forget it i told my therapist about it one session and she thought it wa fascinating she said that anxiety is stored in the body too so that s why i can feel the negative feeling even if i forget why it s there just curious i m not seeing that therapist anymore or else i d ask her
