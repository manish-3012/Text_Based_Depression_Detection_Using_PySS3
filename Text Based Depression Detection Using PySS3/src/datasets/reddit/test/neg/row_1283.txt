my anxiety affect my life but it s not debilitating for me like it is for others i get panic attack very rarely my brain is never quiet though it s always going and cycling around thought even when i m trying to let them go i see my dog and feel happy then my brain immediately say what if he died though and it show me what that would look like stupid thing like that i also have ibs that worsens with stress i guess i wa just wondering if anyone out there ha tried any med even though they can deal with their symptom and if it helped i m a bit worried about side effect but if i could just live without having to ob over thing and feel defensive all the time that would be pretty amazing i will ask my doctor of course but wanted to hear from others in my situation
