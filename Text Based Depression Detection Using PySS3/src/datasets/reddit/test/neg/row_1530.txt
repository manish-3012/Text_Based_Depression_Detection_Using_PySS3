so in december i wa admitted to a mental hospital after developing psychosis i only had delusion no hallucination they ruled out schizophrenia and left it at marijuana induced i have a medical card although fitting the timeline i received a covid vaccine and wa hit hard with covid a week later right before all of this i did research into what other reason cause psychosis and covid and or the vaccine actually ha caused psychosis due to neurological damage from the virus i have always struggled with anxiety and have been on lexapro for the last year although nothing could prepare me for the withdrawal i had when stopping zyprexa i reached a point where i had an existential crisis which lead to existential depression while trying to recover i m a person who hyper fixates on thing so of course i couldn t stop thinking what s the point of doing anything i lost interest in literally everything i wa prescribed wellbutrin which helped me out of bed but did not let allow me to just relax outside of work i used to love movie video game etc now i can t even enjoy those thing without being in my head about how much i dislike everything i m curious though i m stopping wellbutrin today and have been switching over to buspar and lexapro combination while on wellbutrin i couldn t get drunk or high no matter how many shot 0 within a few hour i m definitely not going to continue that habit but wa curious if anyone else had this issue and did it resolve once stopping wellbutrin i don t mind living a simple life i have a good girlfriend good family good job and live in a small town in oklahoma i own a gym so some of my hobby are lifting weight and doing yoga but i can t obviously do that i need to be able to turn off my mind and watch some television or game i m hoping once i start being able to smoke again i ll be able to start enjoying the relaxation of video game and television also how is buspar tldr had psychosis developed existential depression on wellbutrin but i can t get high or drunk will that resolve when stopping also how wa buspar for your obsessive thought
