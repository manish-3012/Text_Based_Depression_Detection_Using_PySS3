every time i get out the house i start to panic and shake my grandma just got into the hospital and i feel so overwhelmed by everything i feel like the world is putting everything on my shoulder right now and every breath i cave in it s like i don t have anyone to talk to about my problem like it doesn t seem like anyone want to hear me or listen to me so why bother i just feel like i should just close down and shut myself in
