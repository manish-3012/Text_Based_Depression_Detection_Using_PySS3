i spent my 0 s in a real mess i let anxiety get the better of me and quit a job outright with nothing to go to i developed agoraphobia and lied to family and friend that i wa still working i got really sick and couldn t go to interview because i didn t know how i would explain an month gap luckily i got a volunteering job which led to full time employment which i ve been in for year the only problem is the pay is terrible and the hour are incredibly long after year of deliberating i recently decided to apply for another job i got an interview but they told me that they wanted to discus my gap i panicked and pulled out of the interview i didn t want to humiliate myself in front of stranger that i had a break down and can t handle pressure i can t see myself lying about what i wa up to that year without my nervousness giving me away i just couldn t do it it suck because i really wanted to work for that organisation but i just chickened out i just feel like crap right now i guess i just needed to offload thanks for reading
