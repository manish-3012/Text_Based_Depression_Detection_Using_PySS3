i m am worried about potentially developing schizophrenia eventually my sister 0 is suffering from this disease right now of my mom aunt also had it my parent did not have it they both passed away and year ago i know the onset of symptom typically occurs in the 0 for male i smoked weed very often almost daily when i wa in a smoking mode but i also took a few tolerance break anywhere from month the past year but recently i decided to stop i also tripped on lsd 9 time within one year but the last trip i had wa almost year ago i know lsd weed and stressful situation can trigger dormant mental illness in people but i am wondering if schizophrenia would already have been triggered and active in me given my history i didn t know i had a family history of the disease until about year ago so please don t shame me for my ignorance i also just found out there wa a link between weed and schizophrenia in the past year and thankfully i have conquered my battle with weed even though it took some time do you think my previous drug usage will come back to haunt me if someone could provide some number for what my odds look like that would be nice a far a i can tell i am not in a prodromal phase but after leaving the weed behind i am worrying myself a lot thinking about all this thanks for any input
