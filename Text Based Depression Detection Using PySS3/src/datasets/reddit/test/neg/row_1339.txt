idk who need to hear this but im really proud of you and you should be of yourself too recently i said that to someone and she said i m proud of myself too and idk how to explain you guy but it really blown my mind like i take myself for granted but we need to understand how much we are doing and living despite having this anxiety i wasn t able to tell my friend about my struggle because im not strong enough to let the people in my life know of my struggle but still i feel proud of myself yes it get messy but we are doing our best and should be proud of ourselves
