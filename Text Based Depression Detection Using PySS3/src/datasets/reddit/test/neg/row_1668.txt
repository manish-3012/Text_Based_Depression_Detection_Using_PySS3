i m have aspect of social anxiety and notice it largely when talking with people i view a smart and they start bringing up some complex idea a they are explaining it i often go through this cycle of oh no they re explaining something complicated you better pay attention or they ll find out your dumb then of course i ve zoned out for a few second now playing catch up and i either nod along praying they think im following or if i m feeling brave ask them to repeat there s a major imposter syndrome component i know but i m just wondering if anyone else struggle with this kind of thing ha any recommendation
