for context i m an english teacher at a small private english school the school is so small i m the only teacher no sub i got my period last night and a always the first day is the worst cramp headache nausea needing the loo every minute and i feel so freaking cold today no matter what i do i just can t seem to get warm so i cancelled my two afternoon lesson and asked the receptionist to deal with a meeting with a potential client herself i mean that s pretty much her job anyway but i feel so guilty for cancelling the class the nausea got worse a soon a i sent the text to my bos i feel bad that i have to cancel two class in one day especially since i had a week holiday the week before last maybe the student are losing too much lesson time this year my class today were from to 0 and then to but i don t go home in the gap between meaning i d have to sit at my desk with nothing comfy or warm for hour all while feeling really crappy idk just looking for someone to tell me it ok to take a sick day if i need it and tell the anxiety voice to shut the heck up edit thank you so much to everyone who commented and got me through the day i went to bed feeling better emotionally and physically than when i got up today is a new day
