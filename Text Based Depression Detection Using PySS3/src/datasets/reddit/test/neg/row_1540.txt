i am deathly afraid of driving over an hour away from my town i hate the feeling that i m vulnerable to my car breaking down and me getting stuck over night somewhere is this stupid the fear is very intense and crippling the thought of having a panic attack somewhere off an interstate exit and being hundred of mile from anyone i know to bring me comfort
