i recently got caught at my school with a very small amount of weed my dad ha a number of reason to be worried about this he work in an environment where addict are he ha went to rehab for alcohol in last year ha had sister die of overdose etc he ha not gone to work for day in a row now and he tell me it s because of anxiety whenever i ask him what s on his mind he just say idk and that i can t do anything to help him now mind you i haven t spoken a single word to him about the incident stated at the start even though he is well informed of it every morning around the same time i hear him vomiting i don t have much experience with alcohol so i can t judge too quickly here and i understand i m probably not leaving enough info for anyone else to fully decide too whether this could be anxiety or something else just what should i do in a situation like this ha anyone had any experience with vomiting around the same time due to anxiety
