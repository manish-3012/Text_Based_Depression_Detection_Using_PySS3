they didn t respond after a day so i brought it up in person if they even got it and if they liked it they said that picture stress them out knowing that they could be accessed by a hacker and that they didn t do it for them i like to send picture when i m feeling good because it make me feel even better but this sting of rejection is really tough for my anxiety i feel silly and ashamed and don t understand how he didn t like it
