i m currently taking 0mg effexor xr for anxiety and depression i ve also taken lexapro 0mg for year and zoloft 00mg for a year both had similar effect barely put a dent in my anxiety and really helped with the severe symptom of depression but it s still there my anxiety is still bad particularly my physical symptom i always feel on edge and nervous i can always feel my heart pounding hard not fast regardless of my mental state and it s the most debilitating symptom i feel i can never relax and never truly enjoy myself because of how anxious i feel i take propranolol 0mg twice a day and is the only thing that help a little with the physical symptom but they re still problematic i have tried meditation breathing exercise exercise i have read a multitude of book on cognitive behavioral therapy acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness no exercise in the book ha helped with the symptom whatsoever i should also mention i have had test for my thyroid adrenal any gi or diet issue antibody etc and i m sure i can rule out physical cause is anyone else in a similar boat to me and found buspirone helped if no ha anything helped you thanks
