asking because i m not sure and it just happened yesterday so the memory is still fresh from what i ve learned panic attack can make people genuinely believe they re dying or like their throat is closing up but i don t get that feeling for me i feel like i can t get enough air and that every time i have to take a deep breath but taking slow breath is really hard and near impossible sometimes and when i do try to breathe normal or deep breath i get dizzy like the act of taking in the air make my head spin causing me to feel more uncomfortable and disoriented i ll also get racing thought centered around how people interact with me will want to talk to me have spoken to me how i m a failure how people would be better off not knowing me how i ve fucked up in the past and so on when i get those thought it get really hard to slow them down and breathe yesterday when it happened i wa literally just in bed hugging my pillow really tightly because of the stress trying to focus on the music but it took roughly 0min 0min before i fully calmed down is this normal is this a panic attack or something else even though i didn t believe i wa dying or felt like my throat wa closing up if this is a panic attack how the fuck am i supposed to stop it or help it deep breath don t help meditation make it a thousand time worse trying grounding technique make it worse too knowing i don t have trick to end it make me feel worse during it
