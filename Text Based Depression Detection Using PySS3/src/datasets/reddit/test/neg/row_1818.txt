i m m and i have been single my whole life because my anxiety around girl a a young kid up till now i have always had this anxiety towards girl i like and this fear ha stopped me from pursuing girl also i get anxious in crowd or party which i try to avoid at all cost when i go any place where there are a lot of girl like the gym i get really anxious if cute girl are around me i always hope none of them talk to me because i will get anxious and it may show it always feel like i m battling myself to look normal and not anxious to minimize my anxiety i avoid eye contact with any girl i would say i m a handsome guy and i have been told that all my life by several people i m also confident in myself for the most part i think but despite that i still have this anxiety towards girl and the thing is i know the way to cure this is to start talking to girl but the fear is too much for me it ha got to the point were i m starting to accept that i may be single for the rest of my life another thing is my parent always ask me if i m gay they always say how am i handsome and don t get girl i always tell them it because i have anxiety but they still don t understand this just needed to vent thanks for reading
