hi first post here so sorry if i m doing anything wrong recently i ve been suffering from very intense anxiety and panic attack nearly every night they re usually triggered around midnight and last through to around 9am normally preventing me from getting any sleep at all during the night my bedroom also seems to be one major trigger a i m able to calm myself down sometimes but a soon a i re enter my bedroom the panic flare up all over again and it s like i m in full fight or flight mode during the daytime the panic is almost nonexistent i think the most difficult part is that it generally happens during hour when nobody is around to give me comfort so strong feeling of isolation and hopelessness often accompany that brings me to my question for anyone who ha experienced nightly anxiety what ha brought you comfort during a time when you re unable to reach out to others i would love to hear about your experience and the thing that have helped bring you comfort in a time of isolation thanks
