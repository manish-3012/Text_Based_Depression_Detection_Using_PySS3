hey so i have health anxiety and got blood work done result will be posted in a couple week i believe however lymph node are a major cause of my health anxiety right now i m concerned with two knot which are in the exact same spot on opposite side i barely felt them a few month ago and assumed it wa a muscle or tendon since they were literally in the same spot there is one on each side above my collarbone not on my neck but in that little pocket you can create while shrugging supraclavicular fossa is the specific name for the location i believe anyway i have these soft and moveable lump on each side are they lymph node if so they seem large maybe like a quarter in size give or take to be fair they haven t seem to grow at all since i last felt them which wa late last year no fever no night sweat no trouble breathing etc i had a cold where i coughed and sneezed a lot a month ago but all symptom went away also you can not see the two lump unless i tilt my head to other side shrug my shoulder and try to flex my neck a little bit at that point you can clearly see them you can most certainly feel them i have absolutely no clue what the hell they are and why one is on both side it doesn t seem to be apart of my anatomy seems abnormal thought experience suggestion i ll bring it up to my doc can t believe i forgot
