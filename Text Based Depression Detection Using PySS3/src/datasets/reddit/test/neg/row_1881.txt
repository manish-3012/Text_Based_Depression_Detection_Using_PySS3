when i wa younger my mom would get me for month out of every summer a written out in the divorce paper during this month i wa hardly allowed to shower or brush my teeth and i often got in trouble for asking repeatedly for food or saying that i wa hungry i wasn t allowed to make friend in my mom s apartment complex and i wa never allowed to go outside unless my mom wa taking me to get food or we were doing her shopkick stuff i wa forced to drink coffee even though i didn t like it at the time and she d smoke in the apartment without opening a window from time to time a you guy can probably imagine i hated it there and i would become very unhealthy my mom would keep me up all night and refuse to let me go to sleep until like am i d pray for her to leave the apartment to go to the gas station for ciggarretts so that i could at least brush my teeth and chug down some water i wasn t allowed to drink water either because my mom didn t like it and she didn t want me drinking the tap water i wa only allowed to drink soda i d wait for her to fall asleep on the couch and try to sneak off to bed and finally get some sleep sometimes she d wake up while i wa sneaking and i d play it off a i wa going to the bathroom i wa always deathly afraid of making her mad because she d emotionally berate me or go overboard with the belt i wa also always afraid of getting caught for brushing my teeth or showering or going to sleep i wa ok for the most part when i d live with my dad i wa usually irritable for the next few week while i d readjust but now i m a sophmore in college and i m finding myself becoming more and more introverted and having more anxiety with le control over my emotion i am also doing the same exact thing that i d do when i wa with my mom for that month eating no more than once a day not sleeping staying up all night watching tv not taking shower not getting up to drink water not going outside and not talking to people and it s not for lack of wanting to do these thing i ve also seemingly developed a skin picking disorder where i pick my acne pick my bottom lip until it s completely covered in blood and my lip is raw and slightly swollen and pick my cuticle to the point of cry when i put my hand under running water i ve noticed that when i m picking at my skin i m thinking about how much i want to take a shower go to sleep eat food or drink water i have no idea why i m anxious about those thing again i m living with my boyfriend who encourages me to be healthy and is the complete opposite of my mom he s perfect all i know is that i need it to stop before my skin picking and or my introversion becomes so severe i can t come back to it i can t even go to the store by myself right now and i wa very independent my freshman year of college i m sorry for this being so long but if anyone ha any idea or advice that can help me get to the bottom of whatever is triggering me to feel this way again please comment below ask any additional question if you need to i would greatly appreciate it
