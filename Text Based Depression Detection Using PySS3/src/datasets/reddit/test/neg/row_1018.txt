recently wa diagnosed with gad and though i kind of knew i had some sort of anxiety disorder my whole life being diagnosed motivated me to stop avoiding and confront everything i started going to therapy and i learned a lot about myself but the more i practice mindfulness the more i ve come to hate myself i ve spent my whole life constantly caring so much about what others thought of me that i never stepped out of my comfort zone i feel like i have no sense of self identity i convinced myself throughout high school that i wa okay being alone and bypassed a bunch of opportunity i would ve never admitted it out loud before but i realized have such a low self esteem most problem i have created in my life is a result of me it s not like i didn t know this from before hand but admitting it ha made the thought more prevalent i don t know why i feel worse in this sense after getting a diagnosis
