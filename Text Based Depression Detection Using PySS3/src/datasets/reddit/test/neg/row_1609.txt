ativan is the only one that work for me and shuts my anxiety up but lately i have been depending on it way too much i have been taking up to mg of ativan everyday for the last few week because of a lot of stress in my life and it is the only thing that help with my ocd and intense panic attack im worry to death about developing some sort of dependency but idk what else to go to lexapro help but not a well i have been thinking about maybe taking lyrica instead since it help with anxiety epilepsy and seems fairly similar to ativan and adding in clonidine for my physical anxiety doe anyone have any experience or recommendation i have been limiting myself to only mg and not going any higher but i am basically house bound with panic if i dont take it so not taking something similar is not an option
