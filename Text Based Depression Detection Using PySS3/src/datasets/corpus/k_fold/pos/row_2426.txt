watch movies nick mancuso because frankly love guy even though ages typically cast baddie longtime fans note reason blond flick fairly familiar movie terms plot but movies days exactly original rick roberts appealing imperfect husband martha macisaac equally appealing daughter mitzi kapture good job goal angry sometimes pretty hard like nick still got terms able demonstrate charm psychosis however much plot takes place offscreen  like motivation prior behaviors good times bad times  things seem apparent characters never quite make audience ie me final scene leaves everything desired but about category overall cant say cared much characters said  reasonably entertaining way spend afternoon  still like nick
