loved it fan original series always wondered back story would  fail delight me also love fact apart eric stoltz recognise one person  refreshing much like bsg introduced whole wealth new talent  cant wait series start airing well done ronald d moore team  excellent job special effects dialogue acting spot on felt emotionally tied storyline know purists probably disagree assessment felt caprica far superior scifi stuff produced last decade
