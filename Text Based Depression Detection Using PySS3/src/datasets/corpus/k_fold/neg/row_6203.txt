correlated odd know think take away opposite ide considering laziness pretty much got flunked college really seen pan elsewhere mother father worked asses build good lives end significantly worse off hard work trying get better way helped thing ive learned psychology really science therapists clue actually help psychiatrists mostly guessing lessons hard learned  medications  different families antidepressants plus atypical antipsychotic now may looking thinking thats great all actually suicidal honestly im entirely sure im basically miserable nothing brings pleasure joy nothing feels meaningful hell things barely even feel real everything annoys me people seem slow dull get frustrated sometimes downright mad look around world shit everything monitored monotized marketed parasocial relationships weird bizarrely intermingled capitalism branding companies try obfuscate friendly individuals behind sassy twitter messages paying workers peanuts know ceo wendys major trump supporter bullshit bootstrap mentality omnipresent attempting point institutionalized flaws system means looking excuses days ago phones keyboard started displaying microsofts name reason even type im advertised at world morphed comical exaggeration they live feels like anytime try show someone like  minute long fight scene they live want guy put god damn glasses oh said before sex  years face that knowledge that realistically theres much anything change face apathetic majority see redflag bad idea yes family friends sad honestly job keep happy anymore job keep happy thats imposition impose them id hope me ive set date best friend roommate former so finishes last semester school know death absolutely destroy him im sorry will but going happen want degree fall back recovers leave think

negligibly related close know want feel obligated participate keeping alive vague idea theyre supposed do finally really want it
