down maybe relateive down dark imagine waking paralyzing fear sure im may dreaming didnt know afraid felt like everything afraid turn head raise arm paralyzed id sit bed scared negative thoughts racing head would go days weeks months id look outside window trees appeared fake almost plastic nothing beautiful one single happy thought could penetrate concrete wall encased brain fight every second trying keep head water driving work daydreaming crashing listening family voices unrecognizable ghosts taunt me keep going one morning wake feel it crack concrete restriction mind lessened ever slightly thought one simple thought maybe chance hope hold onto thought dear life one thought keeping going weeks go day new ray light somehow someway managing pierce thick fog clouds mind one happy thought fog breaks im driving happening feels though shock waves ripping body breathed first time dont know else scream cannot contain emotions coming trapped ride wave long lasts long hit another slope cycle repeats itself im stuck idk many fights left me
