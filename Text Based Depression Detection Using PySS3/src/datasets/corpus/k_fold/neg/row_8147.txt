im trappedim trapped military im trapped life feel deep loneliness stomach desperately want connect someone want someone understand everything feels superficial feel like always alone forever die im gripping feeling want pass im desperate loneliness overwhelm enough pushes end all feeling feels real true anymore everything else feels fake delusional feel like sharing thoughts makes peoples life complicated burdens then everyone thinks im fine im really looking answers cant fall asleep
