drowningim trying hard cry start know hours stop biting inside cheeks hard can hoping pain shock thoughts stall tears feeling like utter failure when despite every effort tears come always do messy painful stings cheeks roll down feel spiralling control drowning beneath waves keep crashing me theres relief down logic sense searing raw pain chest gasp air feeling failed again lost last shred hope know okay anymore think even want okay im tired fighting survive want sleep dreams waking
