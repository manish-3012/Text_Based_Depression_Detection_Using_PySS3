wish strength end now alli cant ever anything right feel empty hopeless im exhausted see another day cant see point living everything hurts pain going inevitably grow much more loneliness strangling me darkness clouding heart soul dont feel anything light within put out ever feel true happiness thoughts death accompany everywhere go door leave plane earth here could leave see whats side maybe death next great adventure guts now time comes again time ill ready say goodbye
