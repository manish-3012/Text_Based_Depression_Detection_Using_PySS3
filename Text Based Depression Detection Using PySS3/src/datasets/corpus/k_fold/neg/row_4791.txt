wishing could dieit sounds nice waking early making cup tea sitting write goodbye notes simple sweet let know care give closure clean room spotless  wipe windows rearrange books launder sheets remake bed put flowers vase spray perfume leave take bus cliffs whirling winds climb simple wooden fence stand mossy sandstone slabs looking ocean then id jump let body go limp end life hit waves sink im wiped clean world sounds nice
