last hopeim tired im hurt im lost world uncaring torment left rot hands held facade caring eyes  years loathing happiness finally coming close say  dont try happy its fault like this  im tired helping you last one hitting hardest left thr lips one called love one asked fiance earlier ones coming mouths blood line like asked happiness torn grasp maybe  years time shut cover old beaten tale maybe right tossed dogs im tired fending darkness closes upon light finances grim lost jobs cared hold love slipped cluthing fingers fate snickered wickedly woth every passing moment darkness looks inviting begging join eternity think ill answer call
