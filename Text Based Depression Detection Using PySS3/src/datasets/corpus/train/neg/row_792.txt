following crimson stained roadwell following dusty red road path turns sideways every step sink deeper deeper thick red blood red blood path special tells dirty little lies finally start believing lies fake smile put someone asks whats wrong path let sleep night pulls deeper every hour sleep cant breathe step step step dark crimson lines wrists finally breathe dark angry lines remind certain crimson path hopefully ill see person tonight
