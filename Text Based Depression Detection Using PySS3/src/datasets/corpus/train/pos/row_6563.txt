say despite reviews angels outfield pretty good movie like fact teaches kids always faith never give yes miracles happen unlike baseball movies one particular movie stood hits amazing special effects well orchestrated soundtrack interesting though liked movie flaws irrelevancy ie towards end ray mitchell hits homer step plate therefore score thats nitpicking say really impressed movies presence moral faith give up
